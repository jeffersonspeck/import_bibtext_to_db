	abstract = {Evidence suggests that fixed and growth mindsets shape human behavior (Rucker & Galinsky, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2016;26(1):161–164); however, empirical research on mindsets is highly sensitive in terms of how they are measured. This article addresses specific limitations in measuring growth and fixed mindsets using existing scales, especially Dweck's (Self-theories: Their role in motivation, personality, and development, 2000) scale, which is the most recognized and commonly used instrument in this area. The main contribution of the article is that it develops an alternative scale that addresses these potential limitations; specifically, the proposed scale (1) measures the fixed and growth mindsets as independent constructs (note that We refer to “independence” among constructs (fixed and growth), considering that they are not just two opposite constructs of the same continuum, but different constructs. Thus, we included items for each one to capture the properties of each construct while avoiding the use of the same items in reverse coding), (2) does not use reverse coding, and (3) comprises four dimensions including important variables that should be considered when measuring mindsets: intelligence beliefs, practice and effort, challenges, and multiple intelligence. To this end, we employed a multi-method approach by combining qualitative research with the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of a survey database to arrive at a 25-item scale of growth and fixed mindsets. The scale, denoted as the Multidimensional Mindset Scale (MUMIS), satisfies reliability, convergent, divergent, and nomological validity tests. MUMIS opens new avenues to explore the understanding of the effects of specific intelligence beliefs, practice and effort, challenges, and multiple intelligence in fields like consumer behavior, education, psychology, and well-being. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the impact of Differentiated Instruction (DI) on the reading comprehension skills of 30 Grade Eleven Academic Strand Learners. Using a pretest-posttest design, the research assessed the effects of DI on reading comprehension levels before and after treatment. The experimental group, comprising 30 participants, received DI, while the control group of 30 participants underwent traditional classroom instruction. It is essential to note that participants primarily used English as their second language (L2), and the research was conducted in the Philippines. The quasi-experimental design involved the pretest-posttest control group with matched subjects, utilizing reading comprehension passages with corresponding difficulty levels. Assessment tools included the Informal Reading Inventory (IRI) standardized test, adapted from Jerry Johns Basic Inventory (2008), and the Checklist of Intelligence Strengths (Armstrong, 2009) for determining participants' learning preferences. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, evaluated comprehension levels. The researcher employed t-tests for independent and correlated samples to test the relationship between variables, with a significance level set at .05 alpha. Findings indicated that learners undergoing Differentiated Instruction achieved a Middle High School Level of comprehension, while those in Traditional Classroom Instruction reached only a Sixth-level comprehension. The study underscored DI's positive impact on developing learners' reading comprehension skills, enhancing their interests and enthusiasm for better understanding. Importantly, integrating learners' preferences in Differentiated Instruction proved effective in fostering motivation and performance, shaping competitive, skillful, and knowledgeable 21st-Century Learners. © 2024, Theodore Maria School of Arts, Assumption University.

Two focus group sessions were conducted, one of which involved a questionnaire. After data interpretation through content analysis, it was concluded that children perceive emotions and recognize multiple intelligences during their interaction with the reported games, identifying specific mechanics and moments associated with these emotions. As a secondary finding, it was observed that the adapted session, featuring illustrative cards developed based on previous responses from the children, showed superior performance in questions about learning. The connection between learning and individual engagement, with engagement being intrinsically linked to emotions, is evidenced through the participants’ own perceptions. It was concluded, through literature and practical demonstration that this interaction exists and can be beneficial for learning different skills, with the collection of such data being important for prioritizing the needs of individuals in design and education. The adaptation with cards, tailored to the group’s needs, fosters greater interaction and involvement, aligning with the constructivist notion of children’s participation in research, knowledge to which this study aims to contribute. © 2024, Sociedade Brasileira de Design da Informacao.

	abstract = {In this paper, firstly, in order to solve the piano playing recognition problem in the field of artificial intelligence, based on the theory of multiple intelligences, the VGG-16 deep network migration learning algorithm is applied to estimate and acquire the piano playing gesture posture. Secondly, combined with the Iterative Update Extended Kalman Filter (IU-EKF) algorithm, the micro-inertial sensor fixation of the piano-playing gesture is realized, which in turn is conducive to improving the piano-playing gesture recognition accuracy. Then, we obtain real-time piano-playing gesture information through a Kinect somatosensory device, construct a piano-playing gesture recognition model based on migration learning on the basis of obtaining piano-playing gesture features, and confirm the effectiveness of the model through the experimental study of piano-playing recognition. The results show that in piano-playing gesture recognition, the recognition accuracy of this paper’s method remains above 0.9, and the application of this paper’s method can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of piano-playing gestures. On piano playing pedal action recognition, this paper’s method shows that the average F-measure scores of these two strategies are 0.924 and 0.944, respectively, which are better compared to other methods. This study provides an effective case for applying AI techniques to piano performance recognition and broadens the scope of AI applications. © 2023 Jiahui Zhang, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the critical challenge of disaster waste management, a growing concern exacerbated by the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters like flooding. Traditional waste systems often struggle with the volume and heterogeneity of disaster waste, highlighting the need for innovative solutions. In this study, we present a novel disaster waste classification model integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques to streamline waste categorization in post-disaster environments. Our approach leverages a dual ensemble deep learning framework. The first ensemble combines various image-segmentation methods, while the second integrates outputs from diverse convolutional neural network architectures. A modified artificial multiple intelligence system serves as a decision fusion strategy, enhancing accuracy at both ensemble points. We rigorously evaluated our model using three datasets: the “TrashNet” dataset for benchmarking against existing methods, as well as two meticulously curated, real-world datasets collected from flood-affected areas in Thailand. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms like VGG19, YoloV5, and InceptionV3 in general solid waste classification, achieving an average improvement of 11.18%. Regarding disaster waste specifically, our model achieves 96.48% and 96.49% accuracy on the curated datasets, consistently outperforming ResNet-101, DenseNet-121, and InceptionV3 by an average of 3.47%. These findings demonstrate the potential of our AI-enhanced model to revolutionize disaster waste management practices. Thus, we advocate integrating such technologies into municipal waste management policies to enhance resilience and optimize disaster responses. Future research will explore scaling the model to diverse disaster types and incorporating real-time data for adaptable waste management strategies. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The historical trajectory of Taiwan’s university entrance examination system has culminated in a multifaceted platform for admission. This evolution is directly attributable to the implementation of the 2019 new curriculum guidelines of 12-year basic education. Aligned with the curriculum’s emphasis on cultivating nationally competitive talents, the traditional entrance examination has been replaced by holistic evaluation of students’ learning portfolios. Consequently, senior high school students’ learning portfolios play a crucial role in the admission process. The reformed curriculum is centered on core competencies, fostering student aptitude and adaptability through a multifaceted approach encompassing enrichment electives, diversified electives, school-developed curricula, cross-domain interdisciplinary learning, flexible learning, self-directed learning, and independent learning. This fundamental shift prioritizes individualized learning opportunities. Moreover, to stimulate student engagement, the curriculum and pedagogy emphasize rich, adaptable, diverse and cross-disciplinary learning opportunities. Considering the core competencies framework of the 2019 curriculum, college recruitment should not rely solely on advanced subject tests as selection criteria. Instead, comprehensive evaluations of the student-centered learning process are imperative. Such evaluations enable a holistic education philosophy that integrates learning and life. Talent selection by using professional competency-based rubrics necessitates the collection of diverse materials and focuses on the learning process. Accordingly, a competency-based portfolio assessment and selection methodology should be established. To this end, the talent selection mechanism for college recruitment should contextualize the student learning process, emphasize characteristic review, and facilitate the development of a robust positioning mechanism and professional assessment competencies, which are essential components of curriculum reform success. The implementation of Taiwan’s 2019 curriculum has engendered a diverse educational landscape characterized by varying school profiles and student learning trajectories and encompasses school-developed curricula, specialized electives, on-campus and off-campus engagements, flexible and self-directed learning, competitions, standardized tests, and certifications. Multifaceted experiences such as these are systematically documented in student learning portfolios and complemented by a teacher certification mechanism. To effectively evaluate these diverse portfolios, reviewers require not only specialized expertise but also refined assessment tools capable of meeting societal demands for enhanced review quality and public trust. This case study elucidated the development of competency-based rubrics through focus group interviews and empirical research and identified critical rubric components for talent selection. By understanding these criteria, students can strategically cultivate attributes valued by higher education institutions during their senior high school years. Portfolio assessment has been identified as a pivotal evaluation methodology in the Taiwanese education landscape. This study bridged the gap between university competency-based selection and senior high school talent cultivation through the lens of portfolio assessment. The study involved an examination of the perspectives and opinions of both stakeholders. By conducting a case study, focus group interviews, and a historical review of portfolio assessment rubrics, the study developed appropriate rubrics for university selection and high school talent development. Given the nascent nature of portfolio assessment tool development and calibration in the Taiwanese educational context, a case study methodology was employed to investigate the rubric creation processes of various university departments. This approach is well suited for addressing complex and underresearched problems and for exploring what to do, how to do it, and why to do it, thereby offering in-depth, multifaceted insights. Focus group interviews, a core component of the case school’s rubric development, facilitated dialogue between university and high school teachers, fostering a comprehensive understanding of portfolio assessment and culminating in the development of competency-based rubrics through collective input. Finally, this study verifies the validity of said competency-based rubrics through empirical research. The study findings reveal that competency-based rubrics developed by university departments, aligned with their educational objectives, effectively mirror the core competency emphasis of the 2019 curriculum reform. Although rarely used in college recruitment, portfolio assessment is widely used by teachers to examine student performance and assessment results. This research demonstrates the efficacy of assessing students across diverse learning domains. To address the challenge of appropriate talent selection, this study expands the traditional archival assessment approach. Focus group interviews involving university and high school faculty facilitated the refinement of competency-based rubric dimensions and promoted portfolio assessment. These interviews also fostered consensus on rubric connotations. Such dialogue between universities and senior high schools enabled universities to grasp the core competencies and multiple intelligences cultivated in high schools, whereas the senior high schools gained insights into the characteristics and skills required for university success. This study pioneers the application of focus group interviews in the development of competency-based rubrics for college admissions. Finally, the results of the correlation analysis of pre-enrollment and postenrollment student performance informed calibration of the rubric and the enhancement of its effectiveness. A dynamic correction process, incorporating a Plan-Do-Check-Action mechanism, was introduced for rubric verification and calibration. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of other evaluation rubric correction methods. The study results provide a foundation for senior high school students to cultivate university-aligned talents and offer a model for university departments to develop suitable competency-based rubrics for student selection. © 2024, National Taiwan Normal University.

	abstract = {Objective: The study aimed to assess the quality of preschool piano education in Weifang, examining its goals, content, and learning outcomes. It also explored ways to enhance teaching efficacy through improved curricula, resources, and methodologies. Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework for this study is grounded in educational and developmental theories, emphasizing the role of early childhood music education in fostering cognitive, emotional, and social development. It draws on the principles of constructivism, which highlight active learning through engagement and interaction, and Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, particularly the musical-rhythmic and bodily-kinesthetic intelligences. These theories support the idea that quality piano education can enhance preschoolers' overall development and learning outcomes. Method: The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to gather comprehensive data. Questionnaires were administered to parents and piano teachers to collect quantitative data on their perceptions of the quality of preschool piano education. Additionally, interviews with teachers and parents provided qualitative insights into teaching methodologies, challenges, and outcomes. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and content analysis for qualitative data, ensuring a thorough understanding of the research problem. Results and Discussion: The study found that preschool piano education in Weifang met expectations, contributing to children’s cognitive, emotional, and social development. It enhanced skills like discipline, confidence, and creativity. Challenges included limited resources, inconsistent teaching methods, and rising demand impacting quality. The findings highlight the need for improved curricula, resources, and teacher training to sustain high-quality instruction. Research Implications: The study underscores the importance of prioritizing quality in preschool piano education by revising curricula, improving teaching resources, and standardizing methodologies. It highlights the need for professional development programs to equip teachers with effective strategies. These implications extend to policymakers, educators, and curriculum developers, emphasizing the role of structured and resourceful piano education in fostering early childhood development. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the existing body of research by focusing on the quality of piano education for preschoolers, a relatively underexplored area in early childhood music education. Its mixed-methods approach provides valuable insights into improving teaching practices, curricula, and resources. The findings offer practical recommendations for enhancing preschool piano education, benefiting educators, parents, and policymakers alike. © 2025, Editora Alumni In. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim: This research aims to establish to what extent Multiple Intelligences (MI) Theory differentiated instruction enhances second graders’ mathematics achievement: focus on geometric objects. Methods: The study adopted the pre-test; post-test control group quasi experimental research designs the participants for the study comprised 80 second-grade students from two primary schools in the China for the 2022-23 academic year. The students were divided into two groups: The experimental group comprised 40 students who were taught under an MI-based curriculum, and 40 students in the control group who were taught under traditional curriculum. Pre-and post-test of 25 multiple choice questions with options A, B, C, D and E focused on identifying geometric objects. Results: The study results showed the fact that there was a significant difference in the pre and post-test of the experimental group through significant increase in the scores as through the implementation of MI-based curriculum which enhanced academic achievement The systematic control group also exhibited improved performance but far from that of the experimental group. Consequently, the study establishes that MI-based instructional approach, which aligns learning and teaching with students’ learning styles, is more effective in enhancing learning and teaching of geometry as compared to conventional methods. Thus, the research finds that the implementation of Multiple Intelligences Theory in a learning environment increases learners’ interest and activity levels and decreases resource spends on learning anxiety to produce improved learning outcomes. Conclusion: The findings of this study evidence the notion that using MI based instruction is superior and helpful in creating a friendlier learning climate that can enhance the success of the students in the long run. The implications of the study are generalized to the field of education to indicate that adopting multiple intelligences teaching approaches makes student achievement better across all fields. It is hereby suggested that further research study the outcomes of implementation of MI-based curricula in various educational environments in the long run. © 2024 Ani Publishing Ltd.

	abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) plays a pivotal role in the educational sector, serving not only as a medium for information dissemination and communication but also as a crucial tool in decision-making processes. Traditionally, the utilization of ICT in the realm of career studies and multiple intelligences has predominantly centred on academic career guidance, career development, and the exploration of individual interests and talents. This research aims to innovate by designing an application that serves as a teaching strategy recommendation system. This system employs the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method, grounded in the theory of multiple intelligences, to aid teachers in executing differentiated learning strategies effectively. The development process for this application follows the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology, ensuring a swift and adaptive creation cycle. The indicators for multiple intelligences are derived from the Multiple Intelligence Profiling III framework. This meticulously developed application assists teachers in identifying student groups based on their distinct multiple intelligences profiles. Consequently, it serves as a valuable reference for teachers to implement tailored learning strategies that cater to the diverse intellectual strengths of their students. By leveraging this application, educators can enhance their teaching methods, fostering a more personalized and effective learning environment that acknowledges and nurtures the varied intelligences of each student. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.},

At present these intelligences are considered as abilities covering eight areas: linguistic, mathematical, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalistic. The objectives of the present research were to know the psychometric properties of IAMI-R in a sample of physical education students from Chile and to study the differences of multiple skills by sex and year of study.The sample was 304 students of Pedagogy in Physical Education from two universities in the city of Santiago de Chile, to which the Inventory of Self-efficacy for Multiple Intelligences Revised (IAMI-R) was applied.The results reveal that the 43-item AMI-R contains the eight factors associated with the eight multiple abilities, which explained 65,502% of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha gives a value of .891 for the instrument. In the sample, the highest score was obtained in kinesthetic ability, followed by interpersonal. In contrast, naturalistic ability scored lowest.

He labels these units as intelligence, each with identifiable and quantifiable aptitudes. The nine intelligence types differently influence an individual’s behaviour and decisions. The multiple intelligence Inventory and a questionnaire on investment decision-making were used for data collection from a hundred investors. Analysis was done with the help of Pearson’s correlation, multiple regression Chi-square test, and correspondence analysis. Rational decision-making is intellectual, as per the review, and it is proved here that intelligence influences rational decision-making significantly while the other is not influenced.

	abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of scientific attitude and intelligence on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) motivation using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). It is possible to say that there is a reciprocal relationship between attitudes towards science, intelligence and motivation towards STEM. Motivation is closely and positively related to STEM, scientific attitude, intelligence and organizational development. When female students are supported and motivated positively, it is possible for them to be successful in STEM. It is possible to say that female students are the female leadership candidates of the future. Female leader candidates can play a role in future organizational development. Female leader candidates who are supported and motivated by their environment can take their place in organizational development. There is a gap in the research literature on this subject in Türkiye. This study fills an important gap in terms of sampling, research method and data analysis. Method: In the study, personal information form, Attitude Towards Scientific Research Scale, Multiple Intelligences Self-Perception Scale and STEM Value-Expectation Rating Scale were applied to 159 female undergraduate students who are disadvantaged in STEM field and studying at Ege University Ödemiş Faculty of Health Sciences. Results: It is possible to say that most female students have positive attitudes towards scientific research. According to the research results, as the reluctance to help researchers and negative attitudes towards research increase, motivation towards STEM decreases. As positive attitudes towards research and researchers increase, motivation towards STEM increases. In addition, increases in verbal–linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence and natural intelligence lead to an increase in positive attitudes towards research and thus STEM motivation. Conclusion: When the value expectations of future female leadership candidates for the STEM field were evaluated, it was found that 81.13% of the students had a medium level of value expectation evaluation level for the STEM field. This situation suggests that female students are not positively motivated for STEM in the family, school and peer environment. Copyright © 2024 Dere.},

	abstract = {Intelligence is a psychological attribute that has been related to academic performance (Ayoub et al., 2022) and creativity in university students (Sánchez-Cid et al., 2018). In this sense, Dweck et al. (1995) remarked the importance of self-theories or self-perception about one's own intellectual capacity and the belief of whether it can be modifiable, for the achievement and academic success in higher education students. According to Sternberg (1985) theories explaining intelligence have been organized into two categories: implicit and explicit. Implicit theories refer to particular and personal beliefs based on experience and explicit theories emphasize the biological component and the conception of multiple intelligences. In other words, implicit theories of intelligence constitute a self-perception about one's own intellectual capacities. In this regard, studies have demonstrated their importance in the educational field, as they are related to motivation, academic performance and general well-being; however, despite the fact that empirical evidence has demonstrated the importance of implicit theories of intelligence in the field of higher education (Costa & Faria, 2018), in Peru there is no valid and reliable measure to fill the existing knowledge gap on this subject. Therefore, the main purpose of this research was to analyze the psychometric evidence of the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (ITIS) (Dweck, et al., 1999). The study is framed in an instrumental design, for which 1319 university students were selected, through a non-probabilistic sampling, with the average age of the participants being 20 years old, most of them being women (57.1 %). Initially, the ITIS statements were translated into Spanish, the relevance of the linguistic adaptation was reviewed through the back translation procedure recommended by the International Test Commission (2005). Then, the version translated into Spanish was applied on a sample of 319 participants with whose data the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was performed, the results showed that the translated version replicates the structure originally proposed by Dweck et al. (1995). Subsequently, on a sample of 1000 participants, this two-dimensional structure was corroborated in which the Entity Theory (ET) and the Incremental Theory (IT) were differentiated. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was carried out with the method of unweighted least squares with mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV). The results showed that of the three models tested (Model 1, original model; Model 2, with correlated errors; Model 3, reduced version) the second model in which errors are established between items 1 and 2 and 7 and 8 is the one with the best fit indices (CFI = .993; TLI = .987; RMSEA = .047 [.027 - .068]); also, its internal structure is solvent and invariant according to sex. On the same sample (n = 100), validity was analyzed in relation to other constructs and it was determined that the TE is negatively related to Consistency of Interest (CI), Academic Self-Efficacy (AA) and Dispositional Optimism (OD), while the TI is positively related to Perseverance Effort (PE), AA and OD. The reliability of the ITIS was determined by internal consistency, both factors reported optimal omegas coefficients (TE, ω = .786; TI, ω = .741); in addition, the measure showed temporal stability in its scores after two weeks with respect to the first application (CCI = .751 for TE and CCI = .761 for TI). In sum, the ITIS is a measure that presents adequate evidence of validity and reliability in Peruvian university students; its scores are consistent, interpretable and invariant according to sex. © (2024), (Centro Interamericano de Investigaciones Psicologicas y Ciencias Afines).

	abstract = {The present study utilized advanced psychometric methods (i.e., Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis [CFA]) to evaluate the factor structure of the Multiple Intelligence Scale (MIS) and its validity among Taiwanese older adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study design using convenience sampling was conducted among 200 community-dwelling participants aged 65 years or older. Results: The Rasch analyses showed that the MIS had good structure validity and unidimensionality. Among various CFA models testing the MIS factor structure, exploratory structural equation modelling performed the best given its parsimonious and excellent fit indices. Conclusions: The MIS can be used among older adults in a culturally-fair way for understanding their multiple intelligences. Using the MIS, healthcare providers could encourage older people to assess their own strengths and weaknesses of intelligence. The results suggest that more research on older adults’ MI is needed to tailor bespoke therapeutic programs to individual needs in community settings. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The focus of this study lies in early childhood development, a crucial stage marked by sensorimotor and cognitive advancements. The trajectory of early childhood development is intricately influenced by genetics, environment, nutrition, health, and, notably, stimulation, which is the provision of enriching sensory and educational encounters. Toys emerge as one of the vital catalysts for nurturing exploration, creativity, and learning in children. The efficacy of toys varies, prompting the imperative to craft age-appropriate, technology-aligned playthings. Smart toys, exemplified by smart building blocks, seamlessly blend conventional play with electronic components, promising interactivity and amusement. In this research, whether game-infused learning, employing these smart building blocks, augments early childhood development is investigated and its pedagogical efficacy is assessed through educational effectiveness evaluation. Notwithstanding certain constraints, encompassing cost considerations, technological functionalities, and regional predispositions, in this investigation, innovative paradigms are introduced for shaping smart building blocks as didactic implements that prioritize simplicity over intricate technology. The findings underscore the ease of use and educational potential intrinsic to smart building blocks, positioning them as transformative assets in early childhood education. Consequently, this exploration advocates further research and development to unlock their complete educational prowess. © MYU K.K.},

	abstract = {The multiple intelligence (MI) theory suggests that students learn in different ways based on their intelligence strengths, thus, proposes teachers employ a variety of intelligences to engage students in the teaching and learning process. This study explores the application of MI in the Malaysian English as second language (ESL) classrooms and the extent to which teachers provide instructions that meet the needs of the students in the classroom. Data were procured from a survey questionnaire that gauged teachers’ teaching activities in ESL classrooms under Gardner’s eight constructs of MI: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalist, and musical. Descriptive statistics using mean score and independent sample t-test was employed in the data analysis procedures. The findings reveal that only 58% of the teachers had knowledge of the MI theory, with only 12% having received formal pedagogical training on MI. In addition, the eight intelligences were not practiced equally. Interpersonal, linguistic, intrapersonal, and spatial intelligences seemed to be the most common strategies employed by teachers in their teaching as these MI are usually measured in the standardized tests while naturalistic and musical intelligences were the least frequently integrated as they are not included in the assessment scale in ESL. Such findings have significant pedagogical implications as classroom teachers should acknowledge the different levels of strengths and motivations in learning among the students. The study highlights the need to provide teachers with training and integrating personalized learning, utilizing students’ strong aspects, and employing a variety of teaching methods in the classroom. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {The innovative application of Crowd Intelligent Devices (CIDS) in edge networks has garnered attention due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence and computer technology. This application offers users more reliable and low-latency computing services through computation offloading technology. However, the dynamic nature of network terminals and the limited coverage of edge servers pose challenges, such as data loss and service interruption. Furthermore, the high-speed mobility of intelligent terminals in the dynamic edge network environment further complicates the design of computation offloading and service migration strategies. To address these challenges, this paper explores the computation offloading model of cluster intelligence collaboration in a heterogeneous network environment. This model involves multiple intelligences collaborating to provide computation offloading services for terminals. To accommodate various roles, a switching strategy of split-cluster group collaboration is introduced, assigning the cluster head, the alternate cluster head, and the ordinary user are assigned to a group with different functions. Additionally, the paper formulates the optimal offloading strategy for group smart terminals as a Markov decision process, taking into account factors such as user mobility, service delay, service accuracy, and migration cost. To implement this strategy, the paper utilizes the deep reinforcement learning-based CCSMS algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed edge network service migration strategy, rooted in groupwise cluster collaboration, effectively mitigates interruption delay and enhances service migration efficiency. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Efficient health monitoring in Nile tilapia aquaculture is critical due to the substantial economic losses from diseases, underlining the necessity for innovative monitoring solutions. This study introduces an advanced, automated health monitoring system known as the “Automated System for Identifying Disease in Nile Tilapia (AS-ID-NT),” which incorporates a heterogeneous ensemble deep learning model using the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) as the decision fusion strategy (HE-DLM-AMIS). This system enhances the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection in Nile tilapia. The research utilized two specially curated video datasets, NT-1 and NT-2, each consisting of short videos lasting between 3–10 s, showcasing various behaviors of Nile tilapia in controlled environments. These datasets were critical for training and validating the ensemble model. Comparative analysis reveals that the HE-DLM-AMIS embedded in AS-ID-NT achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 92.48% in detecting health issues in tilapia. This system outperforms both single model configurations, such as the 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer (ViT-large), which recorded accuracies of 84.64% and 85.7% respectively, and homogeneous ensemble models like ViT-large-Ho and ConvLSTM-Ho, which achieved accuracies of 88.49% and 86.84% respectively. AS-ID-NT provides a non-invasive, continuous, and automated solution for timely intervention, successfully identifying both healthy and unhealthy (infected and environmentally stressed) fish. This system not only demonstrates the potential of advanced AI and machine learning techniques in enhancing aquaculture management but also promotes sustainable practices and food security by maintaining healthier fish populations and supporting the economic viability of tilapia farms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: Forty-nine 3rd-year dental students who agreed to participate in the study voluntarily were randomly divided into two groups: LCM and PBLM. Pre-test was administered to all students. Students in the PBLM group were divided into five groups and each group was asked to complete a project within a 5-week period and present it to their groupmates at the end of the period. Students in the LCM group were asked to choose the activities most suitable for their learning styles at each layer and to progress by being evaluated by educators in brief interviews throughout the learning process. At the end of the 5-week training period, a post-test and a post-participation questionnaire were administered to students in both groups to obtain feedback. The pre-test and post-test results of the groups and their answers to the post-participation questionnaire were analyzed statistically. Results: Post-test results were statistically higher than pre-test results in both LCM and PBLM groups (p < 0.001). When the LCM and PBLM groups were compared, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of pre-test and post-test results (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Both PBLM and LCM positively contributed to pre-graduate dental education by enhancing students' academic achievements. Students in both groups stated that their research skills, study habits, and learning motivation increased. Since both models adopt the theory of multiple intelligences, similar methods are recommended for inclusion in dental education. © 2024 American Dental Education Association.},

	abstract = {The application of learning based on multiple intelligences has implications for collective awareness about diversity, uniqueness and equitable education. The objective of this study is to describe the level of multiple intelligences of students learning physical education in elementary schools, as well as to identify differences in the levels of each type of multiple intelligences based on the gender of the students.This study is a descriptive and comparative quantitative study. Purposive sampling was used to collect the samples. The 124 respondents included 57 male and 67 female students from Yogyakarta’s Syuhada Mosque Elementary School. The instrument employs a questionnaire comprised of 21 statements derived from the substance of multiple intelligences. The instrument employs a Likert scale of 1 to 4. The instrument was developed using theory, with expert consultation, and its validity and reliability were tested. Descriptive statistical data analysis used frequency distribution to describe the state of multiple intelligences, and nonparametric Mann-Whitney Test analysis used to determine differences in multiple intelligences based on gender. Based on the frequency distribution analysis, it was determined that the highest frequency of intelligence corresponds to the following criteria: the "low" category is in logical-mathematical (22.58%), the "moderate" category is in visual spatial (40.32%), the "high" criterion is in intrapersonal (58.06%), and the "very high" category is in bodily-kinesthetic (54.03%). According to the Mann-Whitney Test analysis, The value of Sig > 0.05 indicates that the hypothesis that elementary school male and female students learn physical education differently in terms of their multiple intelligences (musical, verbal linguistic, intrapersonal, visual spatial, interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematical) is rejected. Meanwhile, the hypothesis that male and female students have different levels of naturalist intelligence when learning physical education in primary schools is accepted because the Sig < 0.05. Elementary school students' levels of each type of multiple intelligence in physical education are quite variable. The Mann-Whitney Test analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the level of multiple intelligences (musical, verbal-linguistic, intrapersonal, visual-spatial, interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematical) based on the gender of the students, but there were significant differences in the level of naturalist intelligence in learning physical education for elementary schools based on the gender of the students. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)},

	abstract = {The Theory of multiple intelligences suggests that it is necessary to develop new methods to assess and conceptualise the human intellect. It is envisaged that serious games can offer an alternative form of evaluation, as game designers can create gameplay environments that incorporate the different intelligences into clues, puzzles and game challenges, so that players can not only acquire knowledge, social support and self-efficacy, but also easily evaluate their skills and abilities. This study aims to analyse the classificatory precision of cognitive profiles acquired from the use of a serious game based on multiple intelligences as well as examine the agreement between the serious game results and a self-report questionnaire. The sample consisted of 209 participants (22.5% men), aged between 19 and 59 years (M = 22.83, SD = 6.36) from secondary to higher education. The results revealed that the serious game presented a different classification capacity compared to the self-report questionnaire. The possibility of identifying different cognitive profiles would have implications for educators and researchers. For educators, it would allow the incorporation of more individualised and inclusive education practices, by adapting teaching methods to each student’s learning style. For researchers, it would shed light on the various structures of multiple intelligences in different samples. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic output and load uncertainty are prone to cause voltage fluctuations in a distribution network, which can affect the power quality. With a particular focus on the distribution network voltage overrun caused by this problem, we propose a two-stage multi-mode voltage control strategy for distribution networks based on deep reinforcement learning to mitigate voltage fluctuations while realizing coordinated operation among different devices. First, the on-load regulator transformer and capacitor bank are effectively controlled using a centralized control strategy in the day-ahead phase to obtain the optimal tidal current for the distribution network, in order to achieve optimal operation of the long time-scale equipment of the system. Then, a distributed control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning with multiple intelligences is applied to regulate the reactive power of the photovoltaic inverters, based on local observations in the intraday phase, to provide fast, flexible, and reactive power support for the distribution network. Finally, a multi-mode data-driven conversion strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is used to coordinate and convert between different control modes, to enable the system to effectively reduce voltage offsets and reactive power losses under varying operational demand. The proposed method is experimentally validated on an improved IEEE 33-node distribution system, and the results show that it can effectively solve the voltage overrun problem and reduce the reactive power loss in the distribution system.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

The experimental group received an 8-week training program focused on MI theory and its application in EFL practices. The control group received training on the influence of psychological factors on student learning. Both groups exhibited significant improvements in academic optimism and psychological wellbeing after the training program. However, the experimental group demonstrated larger effect sizes for both measures, suggesting a potentially stronger positive impact of the MI-based training. One-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for pre-test scores further confirmed a significant effect of the intervention program on both academic optimism and psychological wellbeing.

	abstract = {With the continuous development and progress of wireless self-organizing network communication technology, how to carry out long-distance cooperative control of multiple intelligences under the framework of an air–ground integrated wireless high-mobility self-organizing network has become a hot and difficult topic that needs to be solved urgently. This paper takes the air–ground integrated wireless high-mobility self-organizing network system as the basic framework and focuses on solving the long-distance cooperative fault-tolerant control of multi-intelligent bodies and the topological stability of a wireless mobile self-organizing network. To solve the above problems, a direct neural network with a robust adaptive fault-tolerant controller is designed in this paper. By constructing a symmetric population neural network model and combining it with the Lyapunov stabilization criterion, the system feedback matrix K has the ability of autonomous adaptive learning, and symmetrically distorts, rotates, or scales the training data to instantly adjust the system’s fault-tolerant corrections and adaptive adjusting factors to resist the unknown disturbances and faults, to achieve the goals of multi-intelligent body stable control and the stable operation of a wireless high-mobility self-organizing network topology. Simulation results show that with the feedback adjustment of the multi-system under the designed controller, the multi-system as a whole has good fault-tolerant performance and autonomous learning approximation performance, and the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero. The experimental results show that the multi-flight subsystems fly stably, the air–ground integrated wireless high-mobility self-organizing network topology has good stability performance, and the maximum relative improvement of the topology stability performance is 50%. © 2024 by the authors.},

The understanding of multiple intelligence approaches creates opportunities for all learners to develop their potential to optimize learning through differentiated instructions. This research aims: i) to design and to develop differentiated instruction based on learners’ multiple intelligences for elementary schools; and ii) to measure the effectivity of students’ learning attitude and mastery of concepts. Using design and development research (DDR) anchored on analysis, development, design, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) model and quasi-experimental research, the differentiated instruction based on multiple intelligence was conducted in a private Islamic Elementary School in collaboration with 3 class teachers. Based on the results of observations conducted at the school, the findings revealed that the learners can maximize their logical-mathematical, language, kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligences through a differentiated instruction based on multiple intelligence approach. Students experienced a joyful and meaningful learning atmosphere; hence it was expected that their intelligences can be developed naturally. In addition. this instruction was found to be effective to enhance science concept mastery especially in the aspects of remembering, understanding, and applying. The differentiated instruction based on multiple intelligences should be developed further to examine the effectiveness of the model in thematic learning for students both with low and high achievement. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Conflict and emotion are reported to impact organizational claim performance outcomes, yet remains unexplored. This study investigates the multiple intelligence (MI) context from the viewpoint of the claim management office (CMO), with the intent of identifying pathways to improving the emotion-based claim performance of PBOs. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes an autoethnographic case study involving a PBO-based general contractor (GC). Multiple intelligence theory (MIT) is applied as the theoretical lens. Method of framework analysis is used in analyzing the data, with reference to claim management office (RFCMO) theory as a main source in making “analytic generalization”. Findings: Multifaceted complexities of MIs are identified, including ambidexterity, actions and relations, stress and conflict, cultural differences and universals, meta-strategic thinking and team diversity. The holistic emotion-based strategies model identifies how PBOs can improve claim performance, specifically by adopting theories confection remedy and controlling emotion outcomes strategies in a closed-loop process. Further, the coherent emotions governance (CEG) framework enables CMOs' to upgrade maturity levels, by integrating the strategies, general and specific measures for improving emotion-based organizational claim performance. Originality/value: This is a pioneering study in unveiling the complexities of organizational emotions engagement and the application of confection remedy, specifically in a project management context. The antecedents of RFCMO theory are here enriched with MIT and the pool of the supporting people-centered theories, augmented by an autoethnographic case study, in which the linkage between emotion and conflict complexity is laid bare. Further, this study identifies how conflicts in construction industry can be mitigated by way of a discrete three-category theories confection remedy. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The psychological, physical and pedagogical aspects of holistic capabilities of preschool teachers have been discussed in this study carried out in China. The research utilized the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) as well as a quantitative approach in collecting information from 325 preschool teachers located in different regions. Consequently, it is clear that there are significant relationships among the competences: psychological competences like stress management and emotional intelligence have an acceptable influence on educational and physical competences as well. Teachers’ energy levels and physical health greatly affect their efficiency at teaching their pupils. These results emphasize the importance of an integrated approach to pedagogical development involving professional, emotional and psychical training for better instruction provision. This paper also underlines correlations between various capabilities, which is congruent with Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory. Some suggestions include creating inclusive teacher education programs; developing inspiring work settings; starting health initiative programs among others. Hence policy decision makers can understand that massive needs have to be met by facilitating holistic programmatic growths whilst rewarding continuous professional development in academics field.

	abstract = {Collaborative scheduling of logistics is one of the core problems in supply chain management. In this paper, a multi-intelligent system is used to establish the path planning algorithm of intelligent bodies and optimize logistics scheduling in the supply chain by improving the ant colony algorithm. The improved MAPPO algorithm is obtained by introducing the deformation encoder and attention mechanism on the basis of MAPPO to realize information synergy between multiple intelligences. The candidate order table is established to update the local and global pheromones, and the ACO algorithm is improved with the help of adaptive adjustment of volatility coefficients to avoid the basic ACO algorithm from falling into a local optimum in the object classification scheduling problem. The improved MAPPO algorithm significantly outperforms other algorithms in terms of convergence speed and stability in multi-intelligent body fixed and non-fixed goal path planning, and the path planning results and reasoning time also show obvious superiority among the compared algorithms. Taking the logistics scheduling of peaches as an example, the algorithm in this paper can significantly save costs and reduce the delayed pre-cooling cost to 0, effectively solving the problem of pre-cooling delay in logistics scheduling. © 2024 Yirong Guo, Xuefeng Zhang and Shaoqing Zhang, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The hospitality sector increasingly grapples with the tension between operational efficiency and personalized guest services. In response, this study develops and evaluates a novel platform for dynamic room cleaning and resource allocation, guided by open innovation principles and complexity theory. Specifically, we propose the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS), which employs heuristic-based optimization to coordinate real-time task assignments and ensure equitable workloads for housekeeping staff. We conducted a pilot implementation at a hotel in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, using a mixed-method approach that combined quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback. Our findings indicate that the AMIS framework substantially improves operational performance, as evidenced by more than a 50 % reduction in average room turnaround times and a task completion rate surpassing 99 %. Additionally, the system promotes balanced workloads and reduces employee working hours, suggesting practical avenues for sustainable workforce management. Beyond operational gains, the platform enhances guest satisfaction by enabling on-demand service customization, underscoring its potential as a source of competitive advantage. By examining both resource efficiency and service personalization, this study sheds light on how AI-driven solutions can address the complexities inherent in hospitality operations. The insights gained extend beyond routine scheduling, demonstrating how computational innovations, when carefully integrated with managerial strategies, can foster adaptable and forward-looking business models. Ultimately, the AMIS framework contributes to discussions on leveraging technology to modernize service delivery and operational planning, while also highlighting broader implications for AI adoption in dynamic service industries. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The main purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of multiple intelligence-based tasks (MIBT) in improving university students reading skills and achievements. It employed a quasi-experimental design that primarily relies on a quantitative approach. Accordingly, a total of 60 students, who were selected purposefully, participated in the study as treatment and comparison groups. The experimental process was carried out with reading tasks that were designed in light of a model for teaching the skills using multiple intelligence-driven tasks. The treatment was provided for 12 weeks, in which three lessons were conducted per week. For similar weeks, the comparison group also attended lessons but followed the conventional approach of teaching reading skills. Quantitative methods were employed to analyze the data collected through tests. Specifically, T-tests were used to generate the output for the findings. Prior to analysis, a data normality check was carried out using Shapiro-Wilk tests, and a p value of .05 was used to determine the level of significance. It was found that multiple intelligence-based reading tasks brought a significant difference in the students’ higher and lower levels of reading achievements compared to the conventional methods, with the effect size value ranging from moderate for reading aspects (i.e., reading for main ideas and understanding references) to strong for reading aspects (i.e., reading for details, guessing vocabulary, and inferring meanings from a text). The findings suggest that university teachers should use multiple intelligence-driven reading tasks to raise the comprehension levels of struggling readers in the context of the study. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the development of the times, the cultivation of students' comprehensive ability has been widely emphasized, among which the cultivation of music appreciation ability is more and more important. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for a multi-intelligences music appreciation 'immersion' teaching mode, which is based on the teaching reform of the music appreciation course. Our process involved collecting and pre-processing data related to music emotion, extracting music emotion features, and building a model for music emotion appreciation using long and short-term memory networks. The construction of a multi-featured memory network knowledge tracking model involved cross-fertilizing students' responses to music appreciation difficulty and ability. Through the effect test of the memory network knowledge tracking model and the practical analysis of music appreciation curriculum reform, it can be seen that the average effect of the knowledge tracking model proposed in this paper is higher than that of the traditional knowledge tracking model by 0.15~0.21. The total score of the experimental class's music appreciation ability is 10.21, while the control class's score is 7.78, and the experimental class based on the teaching music appreciation curriculum of multiple intelligences is higher than that of the control class by 2.43%. This paper provides a reform direction for the teaching reform of music appreciation courses based on the multiple intelligences music appreciation teaching program, which is of practical significance for the development of music appreciation teaching.  © 2024 Han Yue, published by Sciendo.},

Examples include the Mozart effect, Brain Gym, the idea that some people predominantly use one hemisphere of the brain, the belief that women are inherently better at multitasking, the notion that reggaeton benefits brain function, and the theory of multiple intelligences. Despite their initial popularity, these myths lack solid evidence. The main objective of this article is to select the most relevant neuromyths about movement that have had the greatest impact on education and society in order to demonstrate their inconsistencies and lack of scientific rigor, and then to show the most relevant academic literature that disproves them. To do so, we will refer to numerous meta-analyses, as well as quantitative and longitudinal studies. However, research on the relationship between movement and brain function has significantly expanded over the past decade. Validated tests and large sample studies provide strong evidence of the physical and cognitive benefits of movement, as thoroughly documented in numerous systematic reviews and bibliometric analyses. Nevertheless, certain educational and academic circles still promote information about movement and the brain that lacks scientific support and has questionable efficacy. Examples include claims about the relationship between crossed laterality and learning, learning styles, kinesthetic intelligence, and the notion that walking 10,000 steps a day is essential for fitness. Despite their widespread presence in some sectors, these claims have no scientific basis. This article aims to highlight neuromyths related to movement and reference high-impact publications that disprove these myths, demonstrating their inaccuracy. © JPES.},

Not many young generations want to defend this heritage until it is eventually lost to time. As with oral literature, Awang Batil deserves to be defended; it is not just entertainment, but the elements of wisdom contained in his performance need to be interpreted. Accordingly, this study aims to identify and discuss the elements of wisdom and intelligence in Awang Batil's performance. The main method of this study is field research through recording techniques, interviews, and direct notes. Awang Batil's performance's wisdom and intelligence are examined based on two perspectives: linguistic intelligence and musical intelligence. Linguistic intelligence discusses civilized pronunciation, language ability, and memory ability, while musical intelligence is seen from two aspects, namely musical instruments and poetry. Analysis proves that Awang Batil's performance highlights the wisdom and intelligence of a comforter through the Multiple Intelligences Theory. It is evident that Awang Batil is not just a 'village entertainer', but this oral narrative has successfully captivated the global community by holding many performances abroad. It is hoped that studies about Awang Batil will be increased so that it can be a reference for the new generation. © 2024 Universiti Putra Malaysia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Multiple Intelligences (MI) Theory by Howard Gardner emphasises that individuals have a unique blend of “capabilities” (“intelligences”), differing significantly from the traditional concept of intelligence measured by conventional intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. This cross-sectional, multi-institutional study aimed to compare the MI of medical students from three Malaysian medical schools, investigate the effects of demographic factors on the MI of students with diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, and examine the effects of MI on academic performance. The MI Inventory was used to assess the MI of medical students. Path analysis was carried out using the SmartPLS software version 2.0. Inter-institutional differences in MI were observed among the students. University A students (53.51 ± 21.99) scored significantly higher than University B students (46.70 ± 20.34) in the naturalist domain (p = 0.05). University A students also scored significantly higher (58.35 ± 21.30) than University B (50.26 ± 19.49; p = 0.014) and University C students (46.90 ± 21.58; p = 0.008) in the musical/rhythmic domain. In the verbal/linguistic domain, University A students (47.94 ± 21.06) scored significantly higher than University C students (39.05 ± 19.23; p = 0.05). Path analysis highlighted a statistically significant effect of family income on the musical intelligence (β = 0.220, t = 2.005, p < 0.05), a domain closely related to verbal/linguistic intelligence. Students from all three medical schools consistently achieved the lowest score in the verbal/linguistic domain and the highest score in the intrapersonal intelligence domain. These findings suggest the need for interventions to enhance language proficiency among medical students. Emphasising MI would make medical education more comprehensive, ultimately enhancing learning in their academic pursuit. © Malaysian Association of Education in Medicine and Health Sciences and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia. 2024.},

	abstract = {Micronutrient deficiencies, including iron deficiency, are linked to different cognitive impairments and sensory functions. However, whether circulating iron levels affect self-assessed multiple intelligence (MI) scores in adolescents remains uninvestigated. This study aimed to investigate associations between serum iron levels and self-assessed MI scores in adolescents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Recruiting 434 Saudi adolescents (174 boys and 260 girls, aged 12–17), we administered the McKenzie questionnaire to assess MI across nine categories. Anthropometrics and fasting blood samples were collected to measure circulating iron and transferrin levels. Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels were calculated. Notably, girls exhibited significantly higher MI scores in the interactive domain than boys (age and BMI-adjusted OR = 1.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.07–1.73, p = 0.01). No significant correlations were observed between serum iron and MI. However, normal TSAT levels (TSAT > 20%) corresponded with higher age and BMI-adjusted odds of MI scores in the musical (OR = 1.59, 95%CI = 1.1–2.2, p = 0.006), linguistic (1.57, 1.1–2.3, p = 0.016), kinesthetic (1.48, 1.1–2.1, p = 0.024), spatial (1.45, 1.1–2.1, p = 0.03), and existential (1.56, 1.1–2.1, p = 0.01) categories compared to ones with lower TSAT levels (TSAT ≤ 20%), only in boys. In conclusion, serum iron levels may not directly influence MI domains in adolescents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; however, lower TSAT levels, indicative of iron-deficiency anemia, may influence MI, only in boys, indicating a possible relationship between iron metabolism and cognitive functions. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Gender stereotypes, as a cause and consequence of deeply rooted attitudes, values and norms, directly affect the discovery and development of gifted potentials. Given the fact that high abilities are most successfully identified and properly developed in early school age, the aim of the study is to investigate the existence of gender differences in the perception of different abilities in boys and girls by teachers, parents, peers and self-perception in multiple intelligences. The research was conducted on 115 lower primary school students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine differences in various domains of giftedness between girls and boys throughout groups of evaluators. Statistically significant difference was found in 11 of the 36 variables analysed. Most statistically significant differences were found in parents' assessments (5), while 3 were found in teachers' assessments, 2 in peers' assessments, and only one in self-assessments. Although the cultural factors, customs and traditions of the Balkan country of Bosnia and Herzegovina have a great influence on gender stereotypes, the results of research on gender discrimination in the process of identifying giftedness are largely similar to the results of developed European countries. The results of the study can be used in the context of general education as a basis for critical re-examination of negative attitudes towards females in the direction of a particular professional orientation. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study introduces an innovative approach to sustainable tourist trip planning that aligns tourists’ preferences with vital sustainability factors. Traditional methods often prioritize singular objectives, such as minimizing travel time or cost, thereby overlooking the broader sustainability implications associated with travel. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-objective sustainability tourist trip design model that optimizes travel itineraries across various dimensions, including CO2 emissions, environmental impacts, and socio-economic benefits. To address this problem, we developed a mixed-integer programming model. Subsequently, a novel Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) was employed. The AMIS integrates multiple intelligence systems and employs meticulously designed and effective improvement methods facilitated by adaptive heuristic learning selection procedures. We subjected the model to rigorous testing using real-world data, and our analysis underscored the superiority of our approach. It resulted in a noteworthy 22.46%–27.95% reduction in CO2 costs and a substantial 14.20% reduction in waste generation, along with a noteworthy 6.46% increase in community ownership and a 7.07% increase in cultural heritage value, compared to existing models and methods based on differential evolution algorithms, ant colony optimization, and genetic algorithms. This study contributes significantly to enhancing our understanding of the challenges and prospects inherent in integrating sustainability considerations into the design of travel itineraries. © 2024 The Authors},

This paper constructs a personalized education management and top talent cultivation model based on the framework of multiple intelligences theory and establishes an evaluation index system to assess its implementation effect. The hierarchical analysis method is used to determine the weights of the indicators, and then the implementation effect of the management and cultivation model is assessed through the multilevel gray comprehensive evaluation method. The evaluation of the implementation effect of the higher vocational colleges and universities found that the average score of the implementation effect evaluation of the four higher vocational colleges and universities is between 3.94 and 4.59 points, which is at a high level, indicating that the implementation effect of personalized education management and top talent cultivation model is better. It is also found that students in higher vocational colleges and universities are more satisfied with the teaching method, management method, curriculum, and cultivation objectives. The model improvement suggestions put forward in this paper from the perspective of students provide valuable references for educational administrators and teachers of higher vocational colleges and universities so that students in higher vocational colleges and universities can achieve the desired effect of cultivating top-notch talents. © 2024 Xiaohong Pan, Haijiang Ge and Rui Huang, published by Sciendo.},

MI theory, which highlights diverse cognitive strengths, has been transformative in inclusive education, while AI tools, such as chatbots, offer personalised feedback, interactive learning environments, and differentiated instruction that align with MI principles. By adopting a conceptual research design, this study synthesises existing literature and case studies to propose strategies for engaging various intelligences using AI technologies. Key applications include personalised feedback for linguistic and logical-mathematical learners, immersive simulations for spatial intelligence, and collaborative platforms to support interpersonal intelligence. Practical strategies for integrating AI tools into MI-based instruction are discussed, alongside considerations for tailoring educational experiences to diverse learner profiles. Ethical concerns, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias, are addressed, emphasising the importance of responsible AI integration and teacher training to maximise these tools’ potential. The study provides a robust pedagogical framework showcasing the synergy between MI theory and AI technologies, demonstrating how this approach can enhance engagement, motivation, and inclusivity in EFL classrooms. While conceptual, the study lays the groundwork for future empirical research and underscores the potential of AI-enhanced MI-based instruction in fostering dynamic and equitable language learning environments. © 2024 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {In this comprehensive study, we explore the intersection between Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory and Islamic educational systems, employing bibliometric tools like Descriptive analysis and Author Network Visualization to reveal the intricate contours of academic collaboration and research in this domain. An increasing trend in publications and cross-cultural collaborations, particularly involving the United States, Indonesia, and Turkey, underscores the global relevance of integrating modern psychological theories like MI with Islamic education. Through citation and keyword analysis, we highlight a significant divergence between research on Islamic schools and MI, as well as an emerging interest in applying MI in religious educational contexts. Furthermore, our research identified a seriously alarming gap in the academic literature at this intersection, emphasizing the need for future exploration. In synthesizing the findings, we conclude that the fusion of MI with Islamic pedagogy offers a robust approach to holistic learning in recognizing individual intelligence domains and fostering growth. The integration of these two fields promises to redefine education by melding traditional religious teachings with contemporary insights, creating a pathway for enhanced student understanding, progressive policy formulation, and innovative pedagogical strategies. © 2024 University of KwaZulu-Natal.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to demonstrate that traditional education, based on psychometric theory, utilizes standardized tests that lead to dissatisfaction due to their selective and exclusionary nature. Meanwhile, the Theory of Multiple Intelligences challenges this approach, contending that standardization benefits some students while harming others. Theoretical Framework: We brought together reference authors in the specific area, as well as others who, through more recent research, have developed studies in educational, cultural and artistic activity in the community, in the area of the arts, culture and their relationship in this field of education, with a direct focus on the universe of the intelligences measured, to be enhanced and reinforced. Method: The methodology adopted for this research comprises a quantitative-qualitative and descriptive study, using a questionnaire (Multiple Intelligences Inventory - MII) with closed questions, developed in a group of schools in the North of Portugal, in which students (n=120) from the different types of education participated: regular, professional and programme for inclusion and citizenship. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the most developed multiple intelligences are Bodily-Kinesthetic and the least developed is Logical-Mathematical learning. Research Implications: The practical and theoretical implications of this research are diverse; among them, the existence of multiple intelligences that manifest themselves equally stands out. The implications include the use of this data for future research in the field of educational intervention for professionals in various areas, mainly in stimulating and reinforcing these indicators and results. Originality/Value: This research is of particular importance as it provides educators and professionals, both in initial training (higher education) and future teachers, as well as for professionals already in the field and educational universes, to intervene in an informed, appropriate and conscious manner in these areas. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {Learner diversity has been identified as a barrier to language learning and teaching. The purpose of this article was to conduct an analysis of the implementation of Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory in the field of English language teaching. MI theory, as introduced by Howard Gardner (1983), offers a new concept of intelligence, one that has led to a profound questioning of what we call "intelligence". As a result, he proposed an alternative view of intelligence that can be incorporated into the range of abilities, as well as the existence of nine intelligences that are distinct from one another. Several studies have explored the incorporation of MI theory in the realm of language teaching since it provides instructors with a variety of teaching strategies and enhances their ability to design teaching methods to better meet learners’ expectations. Moreover, it recommends multiple testing methods based on all the proposed intelligences to evaluate students’ learning, as not all intelligences can be measured using standardized tests. To implement the theory into pedagogical practice, educators should be cautious when it comes to truly understanding the theory and also be prepared to create a variety of teaching techniques in order to engage all intelligences. © 2024 Language Institute, Thammasat University.

	abstract = {The new wave of technological revolution driven by artificial intelligence (AI) has become a competitive advantage pursued by countries worldwide, and it is also expected to bring about significant innovations in urban geography. This paper reviews the development trajectory of AI and proposes a conceptual model of the urban human-environment system oriented towards AI. It systematically outlines and summarizes the involvement of AI in urban geography research from four perspectives: data representation, scenario applications, spatial transformations, and urban development. Additionally, it identifies the challenges, contexts, exploration paths, and future prospects faced in the intelligent transformation of academic disciplines. The study finds that: (1) The interactions between elements within the urban human-environment system oriented towards AI are becoming increasingly complex. (2) The trend of AI becoming a primary tool in urban geography research is increasingly evident, offering high efficiency, low cost, and strong learning capabilities in data processing. This has significant implications for spatial perception and intelligent decision-making. AI has sparked spatial transformations, not only creating complex virtual spaces but also reconstructing social spaces. Additionally, AI supports the development of smart cities and the establishment of cutting-edge urban application platforms. (3) Urban geography research in the context of intelligent transformation faces challenges related to data and technology, as well as the broader contexts of global and local changes, technological ethics, and the development of humanistic values. Future development paths could explore overcoming technical barriers, focusing on urban spatial construction and governance, and emphasizing the research on the effects of multiple intelligence shifts. The discipline urgently needs comprehensive transformation and upgrading. © 2024 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The classification of certain agricultural species poses a formidable challenge due to their inherent resemblance and the absence of dependable visual discriminators. The accurate identification of these plants holds substantial importance in industries such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and herbal medicine, where the optimization of essential compound yields and product quality is paramount. In response to this challenge, we have devised an automated classification system based on deep learning principles, designed to achieve precision and efficiency in species classification. Our approach leverages a diverse dataset encompassing various cultivars and employs the Parallel Artificial Multiple Intelligence System–Ensemble Deep Learning model (P-AMIS-E). This model integrates ensemble image segmentation techniques, including U-Net and Mask-R-CNN, alongside image augmentation and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as SqueezeNet, ShuffleNetv2 1.0x, MobileNetV3, and InceptionV1. The culmination of these elements results in the P-AMIS-E model, enhanced by an Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) for decision fusion, ultimately achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 98.41%. This accuracy notably surpasses the performance of existing methods, such as ResNet-101 and Xception, which attain 93.74% accuracy on the testing dataset. Moreover, when applied to an unseen dataset, the P-AMIS-E model demonstrates a substantial advantage, yielding accuracy rates ranging from 4.45% to 31.16% higher than those of the compared methods. It is worth highlighting that our heterogeneous ensemble approach consistently outperforms both single large models and homogeneous ensemble methods, achieving an average improvement of 13.45%. This paper provides a case study focused on the Centella Asiatica Urban (CAU) cultivar to exemplify the practical application of our approach. By integrating image segmentation, augmentation, and decision fusion, we have significantly enhanced accuracy and efficiency. This research holds theoretical implications for the advancement of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks while also offering practical benefits for industries reliant on precise species identification. © 2024 by the authors.},

In this paper, the multiple intelligence theory is used as the guiding theory, and the multiple hybrid teaching model of the piano course is established by combining the flipped classroom. The Fuzzy-CDF model is introduced to quantify students' piano music cognitive level, the Apriori algorithm is used to generate piano music knowledge point sequences, and multiple algorithms are used to collaborate on personalized recommendations of piano music knowledge resources for students. For the application effect of the piano music multivariate hybrid teaching model established in this paper, a teaching experiment was conducted to analyze it with H Music Academy as an example. The results show that the combined ability of song arrangement and playing and singing of the experimental class improved by 9.74 and 11.10 points respectively compared with the performance of the control class, and the average value of the difference between the pre-and post-tests of the experimental class's note recognition ability compared with that of the control class reached 5.8 points. The application of Multiple Intelligences Theory can stimulate the individual's sensitivity to timbre, pitch, and meter, fully enhance students' musical expression and creativity, and make piano learning more effective.  © 2024 Tao Sun, published by Sciendo.},

The Multiple Intelligences (MI) are categorised into seven distinct types: Mathematics, Linguistic, Music, Spatial, Kinesthetic, Interpersonal, and Intrapersonal Skills. Each prominent multiple intelligence of a learner is anticipated to ascertain their chosen learning modality. This paper employs four teaching styles: Intuitive Feeling, Intuitive Thinking, Sensing Feeling, and Sensing Thinking. This research seeks to analyse the correlation between a student’s dominant multiple intelligences and their preferred teaching approach. This investigation was conducted using data from 133 high school pupils. The data was analysed using the correspondence analysis approach. The findings indicate a preference for the intuitive thinking teaching style among students with a dominant Linguistic Multiple Intelligence (MI). Students that have a dominant Musical Intelligence (MI) are favoured for a teaching method that emphasises sensing and thinking. Students that have a dominant kinesthetic learning style are more inclined towards an intuitive feeling teaching approach. Students that possess a dominant Interpersonal Intelligence (MI) are chosen above those with a sensing feeling teaching approach. © 2024, Artseduca. All rights reserved.},

We conducted an educational practice to enhance students’ personalized learning inherent motivation in the medical school. Through assigning one project per student, we aimed to stimulate students’ curiosity, empathy, and sense of responsibility by focusing on the authenticity of project topics. Furthermore, the uniqueness of projects in innovation and creation was used to enhance students’ understanding of identification and ownership. Additionally, we promoted students’ courage to transform old habits, products, and services through a sense of belonging and conformity fostered within the student community. The timely supervision and rewards in competitions also contributed to students’ understanding of rhythm, fulfillment, and respect.

Groups of military personnel were formed according to the degree of their professional psychological suitability using the “OPVS-2” methodology. The level of PPP was assessed using integral indicators: neuropsychic stability, disposition to military service, tendency to deviant behavior, expressed in stans. The examination of the abilities and moral qualities of military personnel was carried out using the “Profiler+” program, designed for adaptive psychophysiological testing using neurolinguistic profiling, as well as the “PsyAccent” program, aimed at diagnosing personality accentuations. Mathematical data processing was carried out using the STATISTICA v.10.0 program. Research results and their analysis. The possibility of predicting professional psychological suitability using express testing based on vibraimage technology is shown. Decisive rules have been constructed that make it possible to predict the PPP of a conscript soldier with an accuracy of more than 91%. The practical application of a model for predicting professional psychological suitability will make it possible to form in a short time a group of conscripted military personnel for the purpose of their further in-depth psychological examination and observation during adaptation to military service. Data on the degree of development of abilities, moral qualities and personality accentuations, obtained during testing using vibraimage technology, will allow the command not only to objectify the results of the study, but also to build individual work with military personnel, realizing their abilities during their service. © 2024, A.I.

	abstract = {This article studies the scope of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through the HPTD-M theory, i.e., the Holopraxis Transdisicplinary Management. It aims at collaborating to the debate on the limits of AI, including ChatGPT simulations, comparing the four types of intelligence in the HPTD-M Theory, namely empirical, emotional, rational, and intuitive, with the nine types of Gardner´s multiple intelligences theory (MI Theory). The types of intelligence are also compared with psychosomatics, the emotional shadow of the Western culture, the levels of the collective unconscious, and soft skills. The concept of mediating manager has an essential role in showing the limits of AI, which is an exceptional instrument for KNOWING but not UNDERSTANDING. An example of adequate use of AI through ChatGPT is demonstrated through a discussion on Plato’s four virtues. A table considering the HPTD-M quaternary structure of intelligence shows how there cannot be consciousness awakening in AI, since it is limited to rationality. Besides, the HPTD-M’s three types of logic, i.e., Binary, Feedback, and Included Third, are another way to demonstrate that AI is based merely on the Binary logic. Management tools need to be used a priori with awareness of the limits of their applications. AI is no different, a disruptive technology that every professional will have to learn to deal with, like the personal computer in the late 1980s, an excellent rational tool, but not an empirical, emotional, or intuitive resource for problem solving. The AI binary logic does not apply to the complexity of human phenomena. Furthermore, AI can function as a consultant or assistant in terms of an efficient source of information, but not as an effective manager or decision maker. Roughly, through the managerial theory, effectiveness is to do the right thing, which is more than efficiency (to do things right). Then, in this author´s opinion constructed through simulations in the ChatGPT to obtain efficient results, the questions to AI need to be objective and precise in the concepts. There cannot be complex issues involving human phenomena: This is for the effective human decision maker, not for AI to answer since there can’t be consciousness awakening in AI. © 2023 by the authors.},

The framework is tailored to enhance the safety, sustainability, and economic viability of bus routes that connect key wellness destinations across Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. By integrating safety and environmental sustainability principles through a mixed-integer programming model, the RL-MOAMIS framework introduces two innovative improvement methods inspired by metaheuristic operators and employs a reinforcement-learning-based approach to dynamically select enhancement strategies. The empirical results demonstrate that the RL-MOAMIS framework significantly outperforms conventional methods, such as the Genetic Algorithm and Whale Optimization Algorithm, achieving a 27.45% increase in optimization efficiency, a 15% improvement in safety metrics, and a sustainability index enhancement ranging from 7.35% to 13.48% across all routes. The findings underscore the potential of RL-MOAMIS as a comprehensive and adaptable solution for optimizing public transport in wellness tourism. These improvements not only provide safer and more sustainable transportation options but also support economic development in rapidly urbanizing regions. The implications of this study are significant for policymakers, urban planners, and tourism developers, offering critical insights for the design and implementation of public transport systems that cater to the unique demands of wellness tourism. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This research focuses on the development of a novel artificial multiple intelligence system (AMIS), which is more flexible and effective than existing techniques for determining vegetable crop land allocation. Eight intelligence boxes (IBs) have been newly designed to serve as AMIS improvement tools presented in this study. Furthermore, a novel formula has been developed to efficiently select the appropriate IB for various types of problems. The developed method will be incorporated into a vegetable land allocation decision support system. The decision-making of the planning about land allocation for crops, including what to grow and what is in demand during specific periods, was performed while considering important factors such as production yield, crop planting and harvesting time, vegetable price fluctuations, and plant incompatibility, leading to a sustainable production system and achieving the highest prices and annual income. Moreover, the developed vegetable crop land allocation models yield the similarity of the average profit per area, so farmers could plan their crops accordingly. To solve the problem, a mathematical model was proposed to solve a small-sized problem, while a novel metaheuristic called the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) was applied to solve larger-sized problems. The computational results revealed that AMIS outperformed all other traditional methods used for comparison in this research. The solution of AMIS was higher in quality than traditional methods such as Differential Evolution (DE), Multi-Agent Simulated Quenching (MASQ), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) by 21.78, 16.38, and 22.79%, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

In terms of EEG signal preprocessing, an EEG signal preprocessing method based on baseline average was proposed. In terms of EEG feature extraction, a decision-level feature fusion method is proposed, which uses SVM as the base classifier to extract time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear features, respectively, train the base classifier, and integrate the output of multiple basic classifiers through decision fusion. A feature fusion method based on music and ERP was also proposed to predict the response of subjects after listening to a piano performance. Based on DS evidence theory, emotion recognition and classification were carried out using EEG and music features from the perspective of decision-making level fusion. The results showed that piano performance mainly activated the left inferior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left auxiliary motor area, right superior parietal gyrus, cerebellar Crus1 area, right lingual gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus, with peak t values of 4.67, 4.8, 5.76, 5.16, 7.02, 7.12 and 8.3, respectively. The activation of auxiliary motor areas, cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus and other areas indicates that the artistic beauty felt by listening to piano performance can enhance people's creativity, and the activation of the right superior occipital gyrus can enhance people's imagination. © 2023 Minghui Yu, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Ability tilt, the difference between two cognitive abilities (e.g., mathematical and verbal ability), has received considerable attention in the cognitive ability literature as a predictor of various outcomes (e.g., success in STEM). This concept was criticized recently by Sorjonen et al. (2022, 2023) who showed that the predictive power of tilt is spurious, in that it is due to differences in the correlations between the outcome and the tilt's components. In the current paper we suggest that despite this criticism, tilt can still be a useful concept if it is kept in mind that it represents the differential effects of its components. Although in many of the cases that were studied in the literature this differential effect is rather trivial – it is due to the similarities/dissimilarities of these components and the outcome – in other cases it may be of interest. We demonstrate this by studying the effect of tilt, as well as the effect of its interaction with general cognitive ability on educational and economic success. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study aimed to collect and analyze articles related to Howard Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences theory and its implementation in Islamic education in Indonesia, as well as to identify research gaps. The method used was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with meta-synthesis data analysis techniques. The selected articles were published between 2016 and 2024 and chosen as the subjects of the study. These articles were gathered through search engines such as Google Scholar, Scopus.com, and Elicit.ai. The data analysis techniques employed were both quantitative and qualitative. The analysis results indicated that the implementation of Multiple Intelligences in Islamic Religious Education (PAI) teaching successfully improved student achievement and encourages teachers to teach creatively, using methods such as demonstrations, role-playing, the use of ICT, outdoor learning, and student motivation. Additionally, this implementation fosters critical thinking, problem-solving learning, creative thinking, and communicative learning. The implementation of Multiple Intelligences in PAI also aligned with the concept of fitrah. Further research is recommended to broadly review the implementation of Multiple Intelligences in Islamic education. © 2024, SCAD Independent. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research focuses on the development of an artificial multiple intelligence system (AMIS) for solving multi-visit scheduling and routing of multi-heterogeneous resources. The proposed method has been developed as a decision-making tool for solving mechanical sugarcane harvest operations which have been replacing the manual harvesting system with the sugarcane field burning. The mechanical sugarcane harvesting system is a fresh one with a high potential reduction of CO2 emission. Two resources which are fuel service staff teams and technician teams were considered to support the mechanical harvester operations in order to improve the harvesters’ productivity and stability of its sugarcane supply by minimizing the downtime or waiting time of harvesters. Based on this approach, not only the sugar production is efficient, but also the harvesting which is the inbound activity is fuel-efficient. This problem was formulated as the allocation and scheduling of multi-Heterogeneous Resources with consideration of transportation for both resources and service operations. Sugarcane harvesters which get services from the workforce are geographically scattered in each time period. There are various technicians and fuel service staff with different skills giving services to the harvesters. The workforce allocation (WFAllcn) and the sequences and routing (WFSeqRoute) sub-problems were modeled as the integrating problem with the objective function to maximize the sugarcane harvested by all harvesters. To solve the problem, the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS), which was developed with new intelligence box selection rules, is firstly developed. Using this approach, allocation and scheduling, and routing of technicians and fuel service staff in sugarcane mechanical harvest operations is very efficient. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Suicide is a major medical and social concern for law enforcement, a contemporary army included, not only in Russia but abroad as well. In recent years, frequency of suicides and suicidal attempts has been growing among law enforcement officials (LEOs), military personnel included. Therefore, it seems relevant to develop a model for predicting suicide risk. In this study, our aim was to develop a model for predicting suicide risk in LEOs based on express testing results. Our research object was represented by LEOs (n = 591), their average age being 23.71 ± 1.12 years. To assess suicide risk, we used a questionnaire for suicide risk assessment ‘SSR-2’, which is a part of DAP-2 methodology for deviant behavior research, and a clinical-psychopathological method. LEOs’ personality characteristics and their current psychophysiological state were identified by using vibration imaging, a technology for recording and mathematically analyzing micro-vibrations of the head and face. It has certain advantages over its analogues. We determined psychophysiological characteristics, basic abilities (types of Gardner’s multiple intelligence) and moral qualities that differed in people with elevated suicide risk against the control. We identified a difference between unconscious reactions of the examined people to stimuli and declared (conscious) ones, which indicates that LEOs tend to hide any signs of suicidal behavior in them. A mathematical model was built for predicting suicide risk: we developed an integral suicide risk assessment and created a probabilistic nomogram that makes it possible to establish likelihood of suicidal behavior signs with accuracy above 98 % relying on results obtained by a 5-minute express test. Use of this predictive model helps identify those people among personnel who should undergo a profound check-up by a psychological support team. Our research results can serve as a basis for creating an objective concept for diagnostics of suicide risk factors in LEOs © Shchelkanova E.S., Nazarova M.R., Gudimov I.M., Galkin N.A., Zhurbin E.A., 2024},

This paper evaluates the translation and teaching of English picture books to children using the theory of multiple intelligences. The problem of data input and output is solved through the decision-making unit (DMU) as well as the C2 R model composed of the DEA model. Based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and the target classification method to evaluate the students' English learning quality and design the evaluation module, we construct the children's picture book English teaching model under the combination of the DEA model and the multiple intelligences theory, and at the same time, we take the eight domains of the multiple intelligences theory as the evaluation indexes, combine the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and the principle of the target classification method to evaluate the student's learning quality of the English picture book translation and reading to analyze The status quo of children's English picture book teaching under the theory of multiple intelligences as well as the teaching results, comparing the results of the students in the two classes and analyzing the data results statistically. Students are most interested in reading children's English picture books when they are between 0 and 2.4. The experimental class has a higher translation skill score than the control class, with an increase of 2.79875, 2.225, and 1.975, and the translation part of the improvement is more effective. © 2024 Sciendo.

	abstract = {The endeavor to augment the productivity of agricultural commodities is fundamentally contingent upon the establishment of optimal cultivation conditions, particularly in the realm of hydroponics greenhouses. Here, the failure to meticulously regulate environmental parameters may precipitate escalated production expenditures. Our research is primarily focused on the optimization of plant growth parameters, with the objective of maximizing production yield whilst concurrently minimizing associated costs, thereby constituting a multi-objective problem (MOP). Central to our investigation is the identification of optimal values for key growth parameters, encompassing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, light intensity (LI), duration of light exposure (DL), specific Centella Asiatica Urban (CAU) cultivars or strains (SC), and the balanced distribution of different light spectra within the growth environment (RL).To achieve our objectives, we have develop a new hybrid approach combining statistical methods and metaheuristics is proposed to solve the MOP. We integrate a D-optimal design, multiple regression, and an innovative artificial multiple intelligence system (AMIS). This study, makes a significant contribution to the theory and practice by introducing a comprehensive and species-specific cultivation model, using as an example CAU.Through rigorous comparative analysis, the advantage of the AMIS algorithm over genetic algorithms (GA) and differential evolution algorithms (DE) is evident, resulting in substantial yield improvements. Our findings demonstrate an enhancement of 14.27%, 5.24%, 4.41% and 5.11%concerning real experiments, design-expert prediction (DEP), DE, and GA, respectively. Additionally, the implementation of AMIS facilitates significant cost reductions, boasting savings of 8.63%, 5.28%, 4.23%, and 4.05% compared to the real experiment, DEP, DE, and GA, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Current assessment models in education have focused solely on measuring knowledge and fail to address the goals of Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) for a well-rounded, future-proof education. While SDG4 emphasizes quality education, traditional assessments do not account for the diverse skills and intelligence learners possess. This gap between assessment and the needs of SDG4 presents a conundrum for educators: How can we develop assessment strategies that encompass multiple intelligences and prepare learners for the future while ensuring the delivery of quality education as outlined by SDG4? This paper aims to propose integrated assessment strategies as a solution, examining their effectiveness in assessing multiple intelligences and supporting the future-proofing agenda within quality education. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a qualitative research design. Interviews were held up to saturation point with 60 teachers and students purposively selected from schools in ten provinces across the country. Data from interviews were analysed using thematic network analysis. The data were complemented by documentary analysis from the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Zimbabwe documents which included Curriculum Frameworks and policy documents as well as a systematic literature review. Findings: Results indicated that integrated assessment systems provide an avenue for testing deeper learning and help students acquire competencies needed in the world of work, such as problem-solving and teamwork. However, certain conditions mitigate against the effective implementation of integrated assessment in schools. Research limitations/implications: This study uses the use of a qualitative research methodology, hence the generalizability of results in other settings may not be possible. The data collected from the research findings was manually coded and analysed. However, coding the data manually allowed the researchers to be fully immersed in the emerging themes enriching the study with additional data. This means that in-depth data engagement was ensured. Practical implications: The paper concludes that integrated assessment provides authentic assessment which prepares learners for the future. The study recommends that the government should redress the teaching-learning environment in schools for effective implementation of integrated assessment systems so that not only one regime of intelligence is tested and future-proofing of quality is guaranteed. Originality/value: The research contributes to increasing the motivation to deliver quality education by investing in integrated evaluation systems. © 2024, Lucy Tambudzai Chamba and Namatirai Chikusvura.},

	abstract = {Optimizing cannabis crop yield and quality necessitates accurate, automated leaf disease classi-fication systems for timely detection and intervention. Existing automated solutions, however, are insufficiently tailored to the specific challenges of cannabis disease identification, struggling with robustness across varied environmental conditions and plant growth stages. This paper introduces a novel Hybrid Adaptive Multi-Intelligence System for Deep Learning Ensembles (HyAMIS-DLE), utilizing a comprehensive dataset reflective of the diversity in cannabis leaf diseases and their progression. Our approach combines non-population-based decision fusion in image prepro-cessing with population-based decision fusion in classification, employing multiple CNN archi-tectures. This integration facilitates a significant improvement in performance metrics: Hy-AMIS-DLE achieves an accuracy of 99.58 %, outperforming conventional models by up to 4.16 %, and exhibits superior robustness and an enhanced Area Under the Curve (AUC) score, effectively distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves. The successful deployment of HyAMIS-DLE within our Automated Cannabis Leaf Disease Classification System (A-CLDC-S) demonstrates its practical value, contributing to increased crop yields, reduced losses, and the promotion of sus-tainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors},

Using fuzzy theory and credibility mechanism, the article proposes a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for assessing the quality of music teaching. The model realizes thorough evaluation by determining the evaluation set and the single-factor judging method. The study takes two classes of music majors as an example to conduct the factor analysis of the Students’ Music Performance Rating Scale and finds four main factors with a cumulative contribution rate of 33.36%. The results showed that the experimental group applying the Multiple Intelligences teaching strategy was significantly higher than the control group in music performance. The post-test after one year teaching experiment showed that the students in the experimental class showed highly significant improvement in bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, musical intelligence, and self-cognitive intelligence (P<0.01), as well as linguistic, spatial, and interpersonal intelligences (0.01<P<0.05). In contrast, logical-mathematical intelligences did not show any significant improvement (P>0.05). The study confirms the practical application of multiple intelligences theory in music education, shows the considerable effect of numerous intelligences teaching strategies in enhancing students’ intelligence, and provides new methods and perspectives for music teaching. © 2023 Meiying Ni, Fangling Yang and Mei Liu, published by Sciendo.},

By combining the theory of multiple intelligences, this paper constructs a framework for Civic and Political Education that incorporates emotional identity into the teaching stage of each level. In this context, Chinese cultural and emotional identity is taken as the main point of Civics learning knowledge, and an improved multi-interaction Bayesian model is designed to track the state of students' Chinese cultural and emotional identity in Civics education and a personalized teaching system is constructed with a recommendation algorithm to realize intelligent teaching of Civics. The Civics teaching class based on the Theory of Multiple Intelligence has an average mastery level of above 80% for each Chinese cultural and emotional identity knowledge point in terms of teaching effectiveness. While the average mastery level of the traditional teaching class for each knowledge point is no more than 68%, the personalized teaching of Civics based on multiple intelligence theory can significantly enhance the emotional identity of Chinese culture in Civics education. The purpose of this study is to provide a reference for improving the teaching effectiveness of ideological and political theory classes in colleges and universities.  © 2024 Lili Wang., published by Sciendo.},

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from multiple intelligence theory, this study adopted a cross-sectional design to explore the hypothesized relationships. Copies of the questionnaire were distributed to 367 teachers working in public schools in Plateau State, Nigeria, and 290 out of the retrieved copies were useable. The data collected were analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling (SEM), Smart-PLS 4. Findings: The results suggest that SI does not significantly influence TI, while SoW and JS mediate the relationship between SI and TI. Practical implications: The result suggests that SoW and JS are significant mechanisms through which SI predicts teachers' TI. This highlights the need for educational policymakers to integrate spiritual literature as well as imbibe spiritual practices such as prayers, meditations and yoga either at work or privately to enhance the development of SI among teachers. Originality/value: The results offer an insightful understanding of SI and how it influences work outcomes. The mechanism roles of SoW and JS explain the process by which one's perceived numinous object, activity event and job experience influence a job decision. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The Centre for Reaching & Teaching the Whole Child (CRTWC) worked on integrating the seven anchor competencies such as building trusting relationships, facilitating self-reflection, fostering growth mindset, cultivating perseverance, creating community, promoting collaborative learning, and responding constructively across differences with the social-emotional competencies. The ‘CRTWC’s Anchor Competencies Framework’ was developed with a culturally responsive teaching lens (Markowitz & Bouffard, 2020) based on the CASEL’s (Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Intelligence) five social, emotional competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making. The present study, situated in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classroom of 120 engineering students at NIT Trichy, India, explores the need for Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and how language learning activities designed based on CRTWC’s anchor competencies framework and corresponding teacher moves assist in developing the SEL skills of the learners. Learners’ assignments, their self-reflection reports, and the learner-feedback obtained through a 7 week-intervention, served as the primary data. Teacher-researchers’ diary entries were also analysed to corroborate the findings. Visual narrative analysis and narrative thematic analysis were employed to explicate the data. Findings of the study suggested the importance of SEL skills and the ways in which these skills could be incorporated into the existing ESP course-plan. The study also underscored that those activities designed within the anchor competencies framework along with the corresponding teacher moves, support the SEL of the learners even in an online classroom environment. © 2024, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

Lastly, evaluation algorithms were utilized to analyze teaching satisfaction, student motivation, and internal and external influences on adult education. The results showed that the students’ satisfaction index for all levels of adult education ranged from 0.4 to 0.6, which is between unsatisfactory and average. The main external influences are lack of flexibility in the mechanism, insufficient teaching staff, lack of funding, no advantage, and irrational curricula, which account for 72%, 53%, 48%, 39%, and 24% of the perceptions, respectively.

	abstract = {Study Purpose. This study aims to determine the level of awareness of elementary school physical education teachers regarding multiple intelligences in the learning process. Methods. This research is quantitative and descriptive. A purposive sampling system was used in this study, involving 57 teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. The instrument is a questionnaire comprising 31 closed statements with a 5-point Likert scale response. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistical tests. Questionnaire results were analyzed with interval scores. The analysis results were obtained regarding the awareness of elementary school physical education teachers in the Special Region of Yogyakarta regarding multiple intelligences in learning. The results explain that the teacher's mean score for all statements (1-31) is 4.00, categorized as high. Results. The three types of intelligence with the highest scores can be seen in the teacher's awareness of bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, and naturalist intelligence, with averages of 4.61, 4.37, and 4.25, respectively, all categorized as very high. Visual-spatial intelligence receives the lowest score, averaging 3.42 (high). The second lowest is musical intelligence, with an average value of 3.56. Other intelligences in the high category include logical-mathematical (4.00), verbal-linguistic (3.84), and intrapersonal (3.91). Conclusions. The findings of this study can be used by the curriculum sector, school principals, and other related organizations to facilitate physical education teachers, especially in integrating visual-spatial and musical intelligence, in training the integration of multiple intelligences in the learning process. Based on the findings of this study, further research into integrating multiple intelligences in physical education is encouraged. © 2024, DJ Studio. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The development of an efficient disease detection system for Nile Tilapia is critical due to the significant economic and food security impacts of disease outbreaks. Traditional disease identification methods are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often fail to detect early signs of disease, leading to substantial economic losses. This study introduces the Adaptive Artificial Multiple Intelligence Fusion System (A-AMIFS), an advanced model that innovatively combines image augmentation, ensemble image segmentation methods, and ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The system utilizes a non-population-based artificial multiple intelligence system (np-AMIS) for optimizing image augmentation and a population-based system (Pop-AMIS) for decision fusion, demonstrating superior performance. Evaluated on two novel datasets, Nile Tilapia Disease-1 (NTD-1) and Nile Tilapia Disease-2 (NTD-2), the system achieved an overall accuracy of 98.26 %, precision of 98.35 %, recall of 98.30 %, and an F1-score of 98.32 %, significantly outperforming existing methodologies. Additionally, a “chatbot” feature was developed to enable farmers to automatically detect fish diseases using the ensemble model as the backend classification system, achieving an impressive classification accuracy of over 98 %. These results underscore the system's robustness in detecting various diseases in Nile Tilapia and its potential to transform disease detection in aquaculture. The proposed system reduces manual labor, optimizes disease identification processes, and enhances disease management strategies, promoting more sustainable and productive aquaculture practices. This research highlights the indispensable role of AI techniques in overcoming the complex challenges of disease detection and management in aquaculture, presenting efficient and effective disease management practices. By leveraging advanced image augmentation, ensemble segmentation methods, and ensemble CNN architectures, this study presents a revolutionary approach to disease detection in Nile Tilapia. The integration of a user-friendly chatbot interface further enhances the technology's accessibility and practical application, empowering farmers to proactively manage disease outbreaks and mitigate economic losses. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {While contemporary trends in education emphasise the primacy of economic and technological competencies, imagination often finds itself under-valued. This is particularly true in Greece, where alternative schools encounter numerous challenges, some arising from discrimination. Imaginative teaching employs imagination-based teaching methods to support and enhance the development of children’s and adolescents’ physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills. This study explores the effects of imaginative teaching methods on students’ abilities by examining 103 Greek students’ self-perception of them. The abilities correspond to eight constructs, as described by Howard Gardner in his Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory. Prior research has hinted at the potential correlation between these imaginative teaching strategies and MI educational applications. The Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scale (MIDAS) was used to assess the 8 MI constructs and 24 associated skills. Statistically significant results show that students having imaginative-based education have a higher estimation of their language and intrapersonal skills. Further research is needed to move forward from assessing the self-perception of students’ abilities to assessing their actual skills. © 2023 ASPE.},

Furthermore, by drawing on the contingency theory of task conflict and performance in groups and organisational teams, we examine the impact of these different types of conflict on the performance of GVTs. Utilising multilevel analysis, we tested the research model using a sample of 810 graduate and undergraduate business students from 38 different countries who worked in 232 GVTs. The results show that the CQ and EQ of the team members reduce the occurrence of the three different intragroup conflicts in GVTs.

	abstract = {Introduction: Understanding brain functioning and intellectual giftedness can be challenging and give rise to various misconceptions. Nonetheless, there seems to be a widespread fascination and appetite for these subjects among the lay public and diverse professionals. The present study is the first to investigate general knowledge about the brain, neuromyths and knowledge about giftedness in a highly multilingual and educated country. Methods: Starting from and extending two seminal studies on neuromyths, several novel statements on intellectual giftedness have been included in order to explore knowledge and misconceptions concerning giftedness. Our sample (N = 200) was composed of Luxembourgish education professionals, including students in educational science and cognitive psychology, thus allowing to analyze responses in general and according to training and professional profiles. Specifically, Group 1 consisted of teachers and futures teachers (n = 152). Group 2 consisted of other education professionals and psychology students (n = 48). Results: Despite the size and the unbalanced distribution of the sample, our findings indicate a good level of general knowledge about the brain and learning (71.3% of correct responses in average) which does, however, not preclude the presence of the typically observed original neuromyths. Thus, we replicate the classical finding that misconceptions on Learning Styles (70% of error rate) and the Multiple Intelligence Theory (71.5% of error rate) are the most represented, both in (future and in-service) teachers and other education professionals. Moreover, the present sample also revealed a high presence of misconceptions on intellectual giftedness. Discussion: Limitations and future directions are discussed.

Hypothesis testing revealed that high expectations and changes in viewpoints positively impacted self-concept, ability, and motivation, contributing to improved learning outcomes. The integration of technology in teaching facilitated these transformations, demonstrating how digital tools like virtual reality, interactive platforms, and online tutorials can enhance learning experiences. However, the effect on learning gain varied when viewpoints changed, indicating a need for further research into the differential impact of technology on learning outcomes.

The thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke shows a number of reasons why educators included the indicators in designing their content for micro-credential. Educators generally demonstrated that they used all the multiple intelligences indicators in designing the micro-credentials. The findings are encouraging and suggest that all eight intelligences can be included in designing micro–credentials to enhance students' learning experiences with the help of technology.

From this theory, learning can be more complete if the different intelligence profiles of the students are considered instead of denying them or offering a teaching focused on one or two intelligences that may not be the most frequent in the group/class. The justification for using classroom activities and practices inspired by this theory lies in the complexity of the process of teaching/learning foreign languages, which requires the stimulation not only of intelligence, but of all intelligences in favor of a more complete and experiential learning. To promote the practical application of this theory, didactic keys are offered from the framework of each of the multiple intelligences. The article concludes with a recap on the relevance of including activities and practices in the ELEN classroom so that all children could learn in the way that is most effective for them, and that is present in a class that contemplates multiple intelligences. © 2022, Universitat Jaume I.

	abstract = {Introduction: This study aims to develop a web application, TB-DRD-CXR, for the categorization of tuberculosis (TB) patients into subgroups based on their level of drug resistance. The application utilizes an ensemble deep learning model that classifies TB strains into five subtypes: drug sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB), drug resistant TB (DR-TB), multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Methods: The ensemble deep learning model employed in the TB-DRD-CXR web application incorporates novel fusion techniques, image segmentation, data augmentation, and various learning rate strategies. The performance of the proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art techniques and standard homogeneous CNN architectures documented in the literature. Results: Computational results indicate that the suggested method outperforms existing methods reported in the literature, providing a 4.0%-33.9% increase in accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to standard CNN models, including DenseNet201, NASNetMobile, EfficientNetB7, EfficientNetV2B3, EfficientNetV2M, and ConvNeXtSmall, with accuracy improvements of 28.8%, 93.4%, 2.99%, 48.0%, 4.4%, and 7.6% respectively. Conclusion: The TB-DRD-CXR web application was developed and tested with 33 medical staff. The computational results showed a high accuracy rate of 96.7%, time-based efficiency (ET) of 4.16 goals/minutes, and an overall relative efficiency (ORE) of 100%. The system usability scale (SUS) score of the proposed application is 96.7%, indicating user satisfaction and a likelihood of recommending the TB-DRD-CXR application to others based on previous literature.

This review attempts to explore the dominant learning style preferences, main or obvious intelligence types according to the multiple intelligence theory, main motivation type and how the awareness of these could impact the learners’ progress or otherwise in EFL. Due to the relative scarcity of relevant research in the Arabic Gulf region, other studies conducted in neighboring and culturally similar countries were reviewed as well. As a result of examining the literature in this respect, more studies and research are recommended to help learners, instructors, professionals, researchers, and practitioners concerned and involved in EFL in this context. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.},

Therefore, it is of great significance to introduce gamification teaching into higher vocational education classroom. This paper explores the influence of gamification teaching on inducing students' learning motivation and improving students' achievement. By reading and sorting out a large number of literatures, this paper analyzes the current situation of gamification teaching and research at home and abroad, and sorts out the related concepts and basic theories of gamification teaching, providing theoretical guidance for the application research of computer information technology curriculum in higher vocational schools. Under the guidance of multiple intelligences theory and constructivism learning theory, this paper carries out the gamified teaching design of computer information technology curriculum. Combined with the author's teaching practice, two classes are selected as experimental class and control class to carry out experiments with gamified teaching and traditional teaching respectively. Through the implementation of two experimental cases, the comparative data of two classes were obtained to test the effect of gamification teaching on the improvement of students' grades and stimulate students' learning motivation. It is hoped that this study can provide guidance for the development of gamification teaching in computer information technology classroom, and provide some reference for the development of gamification teaching. © 2024 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net.},

We suggest it will be helpful to make a distinction between strong and weak versions of the claim. The strong version proposes that there is a separate and distinct spiritual intelligence that meets the criteria set out by Howard Gardner in his ‘multiple intelligences’ framework. This involves evidence from neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, individual differences, experimental tasks, and psychometrics. We review the relevant evidence and conclude that there is no support for the strong proposal. The weak version of the claim assumes that the intelligence that is apparent in spiritual contexts is the same as is found elsewhere, but it is nevertheless deployed in a distinctive way. We suggest that the evidence supports the claim, and we review six key marks of spiritual intelligence: ineffability, embodiment, open-minded attention, pattern-seeking meaning-making, participation, and relationality. Our approach makes use of a cognitive architecture, Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS), which has been proved useful in modelling spiritual practices. It will be helpful in the future to bring this approach into dialogue with other scientific approaches to spiritual intelligence from psychometrics and from experimental research. © 2023 by the authors.},

In response to this out-of-control circumstance, Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence (MI) theory proposes a new style of teaching that accounts for individual differences. This study seeks to investigate 1) the effects of MI-based instruction on English achievement and 2) the extent to which MI-based instruction fosters learner autonomy (LA). A quasi-experimental design was used to assess students' language achievement, while mixed-method research was used to assess students' LA. This study included 123 engineering faculty members from a university in the central region of Thailand. The English achievement test was used to assess their general English proficiency, while the adapted questionnaire from Murase's (2015) Measuring Instruments of Language Learner Autonomy (MILLA), the semi-structured interviews and the teacher's log were used to assess their LA. The results showed that the experimental group improved their listening, speaking, reading, writing and grammar skills, while their writing skills did not differ from the control group. There was no significant difference in the students’ level of LA after the MI-based instruction. © 2022 AsiaTEFL All rights reserved.},

Objective: To identify the relationships between sex, IM, personality and AR in university students. Methodology: Correlational with intentional non-probabilistic evidence. 572 university students with a mean age of M=17.5 (SD=1.5) (55.5% women and 44.5% men) participated, the study was conducted at the University of Magdalena. Bivariate connections, analysis of variance and multiple linear regression were applied. Results: Thirteen significant correlations were found between the Personality and AR subvariables, and thirteen between sex and AR confirmed by ANOVA. The regression model showed that Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Sensitivity, Vigilance and Openness to Change are direct predictors of AR, while Kinesthetic or Bodily-Kinetic Intelligence and Abstraction are predictors with an inverse relationship on AR. Conclusions: There is a strong association between MI and AR in university students, which can contribute to therapeutic, educational and research activities. The results do not allow us to decisively infer that personality and IM define AR in students. It is suggested to continue research in the area. © 2023 authors. All rights reserved.},

This article seeks to design a methodology for the teaching–learning resources associated with the nature of the prevailing intelligence in the competence-based model. Thus, the “competence-intelligence-resource triangle” was proposed for promoting inclusive education in the degree in Management Engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). A total of 99 teaching–learning resources, 11 competences, and 9 types of intelligence were combined. As far as the multiple intelligence approach is concerned, the 50 students surveyed prioritized logical–mathematical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, linguistic, and spatial intelligences. As a conclusion, the use of teaching–learning resources designed for promoting different types of intelligence in the competence-based model constitutes an adaptive strategy for the students to successfully acquire competences. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Neuromyth is a concept used for misconceptions regarding the brain and its relation to learning. Identifying the prevalence of neuromyths is seen as the first step of dispelling them. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among teachers in Türkiye. The educational neuromyths survey, which contains 19 general brain knowledge statements and 21 neuromyth statements, was conducted on 730 primary and secondary school teachers during the 2020-2021 educational year's spring semester. The findings showed that the most prevalent myths among teachers were learning styles, multiple intelligences, and an enriched environment. Hemispheric dominance, Mozart effect, BrainGYM, critical periods, fatty acids, learning while sleep, 10 % myths were believed more than 50% of teachers. The predictor analyses revealed that gender, teaching experience, reading popular science publications did not significantly predict the number of endorsed myths. Significant predictors were general brain knowledge, reading peer-reviewed journals, and taking neuroscience education. At the end of the study, recommendations for further research and practice are presented. © 2023 Turkish Education Association. All rights reserved.},

This paper is an output of a Masters’ dissertation that explored the use of play when teaching number sense to Grade 3 learners. The dissertation findings encouraged the researchers to explore the viability of play when teaching number sense. The theoretical underpinning of this study was based on Vygotsky's theory of social development and Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence because they both emphasize the importance of play in enhancing social interaction between learners and educators. We used semi-structured interviews, document analysis and non-participant observation to collect data from six Grade 3 teachers from three primary schools in the Capricorn South District's Lebopo Circuit of Limpopo Province in South Africa. The results of this study show that educators lack clear guidelines on how to integrate play in number sense education, from planning to presentation to assessment. Educators need guidelines on how to use play to teach number sense and to be effective. They require curriculum workshops to show them how to use low-cost materials but high quality in lesson preparation. They can play Indigenous games since they require resources that are found in nature. © Mathematics Teaching-Research Journal 2022.},

Materials and methods. The study involved three Division I football teams from the Sverdlovsk region (n = 43). The study of aggression, technical and tactical skills, and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence was based on the theory of multiple intelligences (H. Gardner). Expert assessment was used to assess the level of the parameters under study on a 10-point scale. Results. The use of situation modeling in university football teams resulted in the improvement of technical, tactical, and social skills, including decreased team aggression (by 31%), improved bodily kinesthetic intelligence and technical and tactical skills (by 28–29%), and improved ethical thinking (by 57%). Conclusion. The use of situation modeling that simulated a conflict situation as well as the system of experimental exercises and practice-oriented tasks allowed athletes to broaden their knowledge and improve their tactical skills and reflexivity, thus providing them with tools to cope with aggressive emotions. © 2023 South Ural State University - Institute of Sport, Tourism and Service.

The problem arises in adopting traditional curricula for teaching mathematics, which leads to low student achievement. The study objectives to measure the students' level of logical mathematical intelligence, and find out the level of students’ achievement, and measuring the level of intelligence impact on the academic achievement. The study adopted the descriptive-analytical approach. The study population consisted of (45) pre-service female math teachers. A comprehensive sample was chosen. A questionnaire was used according to the (Likert) five-point scale, taking advantage of the MIDAS scale of multiple intelligences, which consisted of (17) statements, then the researchers developed the questionnaire up to (25) statements. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were confirmed. The findings revealed that: The general average of the logical-mathematical intelligence level for the fourth-year students was in a high degree, when the arithmetic mean of the whole questionnaire was (3.71), standard deviation was (0.74). The marks of students’ semester average were: Agree with a rate of 36.4%, strongly agree with a rate of 29.5%. The cumulative average was; 72.7% for a good level, and 25% for a very good level. Finally, there is a significant effect between the logical-mathematical intelligence of the female students, and the overall academic achievement in mathematics. © 2023 Shirawia et al.},

For instance, the Nobel laureate Herbert Simon predicted after his participation in the Dartmouth workshop that “machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work that a man can do”. And expectations are in some circles still high to overblown today. This paper addresses the demand for conceptual clarity and introduces precise definitions of “strong AI”, “superintelligence”, the “technological singularity”, and “artificial general intelligence” which ground in the work by the computer scientist Judea Pearl and the psychologist Howard Gardner.

Objective: The purpose was to evaluate and compare the level of self-efficacy perceived by the participants with respect to their multiple intelligences, their emotional intelligence, their creativity and their academic performance. Method: The sample is made up of 435 first-year university students. The research design was cross-sectional predictive. Results: Relationships were found between the analyzed variables, as well as differences based on the sex of the participants. Regression analyzes show how linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences are self-perceived predictors of students’ academic performance. Discussion: A positive relationship between the different social and emotional competencies is detected, as well as their importance for the optimal performance of the students. © Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas.},

	abstract = {Research indicates human being is endowed with multiple intelligences, skills, and abilities. In the context of education, many exercises demand multiple skills from students to successfully solve them in different areas of knowledge. In computer science, computer programming is one of the skills that involves the use of multiple skills for problem-solving, where problems can be solved in more than one way (paths). On massive environments for teaching programming, it is common for automatic assessment systems to observe only the final result of the student’s interaction with the learning object, not identifying the individual interaction of multiple skills needed to solve the problem nor identifying a solution path adopted by the student. Many models were proposed based on Elo models, which use performance expectation, and Item Response Theory, but these models do not consider the various paths to solve problems. The objective of this work is to propose a model also based on performance expectation, which individually estimates multiple abilities of students in the context of massive online education, assuming problems have more than one solution, and there is access only to the final result (right or wrong). An experimental setup is proposed to validate the model, involving the use and analysis of the proposed model through an experiment in a database, named beecrowd, and a case study with programming students. Model results are satisfactory, since: i) it is possible to treat the student’s abilities individually, as well as to follow the evolution of each ability over time; ii) it is possible to predict the paths adopted by them according to the student’s abilities; iii) the model also shows positive results when integrated with a recommendation system, recommending problems compatible with the student’s abilities. © 2022, Brazilian Computing Society.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine elementary school physical education teachers' awareness of the integration of multiple intelligences in the learning process in terms of teacher gender. Multiple intelligence integration is made up of eight sub-variables: logical-mathematical, linguistic-verbal, visual-spatial, musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist intelligence.This study is a comparative quantitative study. The participants in this study were elementary school physical education teachers from Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The Simple Random Sampling system was used to collect samples, and 58 teachers agreed to participate, with 36 male teachers and 22 female teachers. Data was collected using a questionnaire instrument with 29 questions and a 5-point Likert scale answer. All question items were deemed reliable because their r-count value was greater than r-table 0.254. On Cronbach's alpha, each sub-variable tested for reliability is worth more than 0.6. For normally distributed and homogeneous data, independent sample t test analysis was used. The Mann-Whitney Test is used to identify data that does not meet the prerequisite test. According to the results of the Independent sample t test analysis, the significance value of each variable is as follows: mathematical logic (0.735 > 0.05), visual spatial (0.880 > 0.05), musical (0.045 < 0.05), and intrapersonal (0.637 > 0.05). The independent sample t test results show that there is no difference in teacher awareness of multiple intelligence integration (logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, intrapersonal) between male and female teachers. These findings also show that there are differences in teacher awareness in the integration of multiple intelligences (musical) between male and female teachers. The significance value of each variable based on the non-parametric test using the Mann-Whitney Test is as follows: linguistic verbal 0.443 > 0.05, body-kinesthetic 0.273 > 0.05, interpersonal 0.826 > 0.05, and naturalist 0.563 > 0.05. These findings show that there is no difference in teacher awareness of multiple intelligences (verbal-linguistic body-kinesthetic, interpersonal, naturalist) between male and female teachers. The findings of this study can be used by the curriculum sector, school principals, and other related organizations to facilitate physical education teachers, especially male teachers, in training the integration of multiple intelligences in the learning process. Based on the findings of this study, it is hoped that further research into the integration of multiple intelligences in physical education will be conducted. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF).},

This study investigated the relationship among Iranian medical students through a correlational-descriptive design. Participants included all 200 BA-level students of Islamic Azad University, Iran. The Attitude/Motivation Test Battery (AMTB) in Persian, the Torrance Creative Thinking Test (TCTT) in Persian, and Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences Questionnaire in Persian were used to collect data. The university archived their grade point averages (GPAs) to determine students’ academic progress. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness-of-Fit Test, descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlation tests, and independent samples t-tests were used to examine the acquired data. The data analysis revealed a significant correlation between Iranian EFL learners’ creativity, multiple intelligences, motivation, and academic success; creative learners outperformed non-creative learners in terms of academic achievement; extrinsic learners outperformed intrinsic learners in terms of academic achievement; the highest academic achievement was associated with the interpersonal intelligence profile, while the lowest academic achievement was associated with the intrinsic intelligence profile. The findings may provide insight to stakeholders in the field, such as curriculum planners, tutors, and policymakers, regarding the relationship between creativity, multiple intelligences, motivation, and academic achievement, as well as the importance of factoring this relationship into ELT program design. © 2023 Author(s).},

Based on this background, this study firstly reconstructs the steps of accounting element recognition in the traditional accounting system and constructs an automated accounting recognition mechanism using BP neural network algorithm, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of accounting element recognition; Secondly, a personalized e-commerce recommendation model based on multiple intelligence is built, which uses intelligent Q-learning algorithm to optimize the recommendation module, aiming to improve the accuracy of personalized recommendation. By comparing the performance of different accounting models under different personalized e-commerce systems, the accounting model proposed in this paper can predict the accounting entries well under the three-layer BP neural network, and the error between the maximum predicted value and the actual value is 0.23%. The recommendation model proposed in the study outperforms the traditional recommendation model and the recommendation model under collaborative filtering algorithm in predicting customers' personal preferences, whose predicted value is closer to the real situation. In summary, both the accounting method and the personalized recommendation model for e-commerce proposed in this study can achieve better application results, thus providing a new idea for the development of the e-commerce industry. © 2023 The Author},

To cultivate multiple intelligences in mathematics classrooms, integrating project-based learning into mathematics instruction can be a promising approach. In this study, we analyzed 15 elementary interns' project-based mathematics (PBM) lessons and observed their implementation at two public elementary schools in the southern United States. The findings revealed that the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) PBM lessons conducted by the interns shared five common features: (a) enhancing empathy and social awareness, (b) solving real-life mathematics-related problems, (c) utilizing personal strengths to enhance the utility of mathematics, (d) supporting wide-ranging and collective mathematics learning, and (e) cultivating personal responsibility in mathematical problem solving. We further discussed how these STEM PBM lessons guaranteed an opportunity to foster students' social and emotional learning competencies in mathematics classrooms. We conclude that PBM provides a practical way to effectively engage students and enhance learning purpose in elementary classrooms and recommend this innovative pedagogy to both novice and veteran elementary teachers. © 2022 School Science and Mathematics Association.},

Biological phenomena abstraction is a primary part of BID to comprehend structures and principles of the phenomena. However, direct research on the role of fluid intelligence in the understanding stage in BID processes is relatively scarce. We observed forty-one design students’ pictorial and textual representations of the abstract structures and principles in a BID task. Participants’ fluid intelligence was assessed using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Plus (SPM+). At the same time, their biological phenomena abstraction in pictorial and textual representations were rated based on a five-point scale of form, behavior, and principle. Results showed that fluid intelligence had a limited effect on biological phenomena abstraction. Participants with low fluid intelligence had a disadvantage on biological phenomena abstraction while participants with medium and high fluid intelligence had equally good performance. The results suggested that medium fluid intelligence was the minimal requirement of biological phenomena abstraction for male participants. We argue that future work should consider multiple intelligence in biological phenomena abstraction of BID. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper argues that the independent intelligences research program is degenerating, since it has not led to novel, empirically corroborated predictions. However, despite its flaws, the program provides an illustrative example of some of the philosophical problems that inhere in Lakatos’s so-called “methodology”. Indeed, Lakatos’s conceptions of the negative heuristic, the positive heuristic, and the relationship between scientific appraisal and advice are all vulnerable to objections. The upshot is that theories of independent intelligences indeed teach us more about philosophy of science than about the nature of human intelligence. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Even though definitions of intelligence have been provided over many years in different fields and disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, these crude approaches often turn out to be overly systematic, rigid, and reductive. Moreover, as we argue here, much work on intelligence suffers from the bias of using humans as a yardstick and/or of focusing on human intelligence at the expense of acknowledging other, i.e., non-human forms of intelligence. By means of a concise literature review and case study analysis, the objective of this paper is to pave the ground for overcoming our anthropocentrism and appreciating the wonders of intelligence in nonhuman and non-biological animals instead. For that reason, we study two cases of octopus intelligence and intelligence in machine learning systems to embrace the notion of intelligence as a nonunitary faculty with pluralistic forms. Furthermore, we derive lessons for advancing our human self-understanding. © Authors retain all copyrights.},

	abstract = {In this study, Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences was used to conduct experimental research on several elementary school students at TPQ Al-Ikhwan Meruya Jakarta, Indonesia. The initial stage of this study was to classify the types of student intelligence using multiple intelligence instruments adopted from Shearer in 1997. Furthermore, learning strategies are applied to students according to the kind of intelligence. This study observed the differences in mathematics learning outcomes of students who have musical intelligence before and after the application of interactive learning media in the form of music containing a song with the title "Aku Bangun Datar" and the lyrics are examples of a two-dimensional figure with natural objects. The research method used was a quantitative quasi-experimental type with a pre-test-post-test design. Research data analysis using a statistical t-test for the difference in the mean of the two populations. The results of data analysis obtained a t value of -8,000, while the t table is -2.0686. The comparison between the t value and the t table is known that t is more significant than the t table, so the hypothesis is rejected. It means that there is a significant difference in students' knowledge about shapes before and after using music media. © 2022, Author. All rights reserved.},

To develop the research, the CRISP-DM methodology was applied: compression of the problem, study and understanding of the data, data analysis and feature selection, modeling, evaluation and deployment. It began by applying a test with 64 questions to 100% of the students under study, where the way of learning of each person was identified, based on the eight multiple intelligences proposed by Gardner, where the dominant intelligence was obtained. According to this, a relational analysis was preceded with respect to the final grades obtained in the subject of Introduction to programming. The results indicate that students who present Kinesthetic and musical intelligence as predominant have a higher percentage of passing the subject. © 2023, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

	abstract = {An abundance of empirical evidence indicates that spatial ability is significantly correlated with educational performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Previous studies have explored the relationship between spatial ability and science achievement in adults. However, the relationship between spatial ability and science achievement in children at different stages of learning remains unclear. This study examined how the relationship between spatial ability and science achievement differed by grade. A total of 29, 524 students, including 17, 378 fourth graders (boys = 9022, girls = 8365, mean age = 9.78) and 12, 137 eighth graders (boys =6294, girls = 5843, mean age =13.73), were selected from the Qingdao Basic Education Quality Assessment database using cluster random sampling. Participants were recruited to complete two basic cognitive processing tasks (three-dimensional mental rotation and nonverbal matrix reasoning), two self-report scales (multiple intelligence and learning persistence), and a curriculum-based science achievement assessment. The study demonstrated that spatial ability and science achievement are closely related in Chinese children. That this relationship was evident in every instance tested shows a certain stability. The relationship was stronger in eighth-grade students than in fourth-grade students, even after controlling for reasoning ability (measured via non-verbal matrix reasoning) and learning persistence. The relationship between spatial ability and science achievement over time depends on how spatial ability is assessed, either through self-reports or cognitive-based tests. This indicates that in children, as they advance in grade and science courses become more difficult, spatial abilities play an increasingly important role in science learning. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Listening skill is the key to learning a language, and speaking is the first explicit behavior of language. In order to improve language skills which are emphasized in new curriculum guidelines, student-centered thematic language teaching is considered as valuable. Through this, the concepts of multiple intelligences and curriculum integration were re-emphasized. An experimental design was adopted in the current study. This study was conducted with the participation of 224 students from the Department of Multimedia Design in universities in the south of Taiwan. The research data were collected between September 2021 and December 2021. The implementation process took 16 weeks (a total of 48 h) of thematic language teaching. The research results revealed 1. significant positive effects of thematic language teaching on listening, 2. significant positive effects of thematic language teaching on speaking skill, and 3. significant negative effects of thematic language teaching on learning anxiety. According to the results, it is expected that this study can help multimedia design students improve their listening and speaking skills as well as core language skills. Copyright © 2022 Yin.},

Adopting a quantitative research design, the study examined both primary and secondary data. The primary data was obtained from a research sample of 160 students, with 80 male and female students each, in ages of 13 and 16 years who were participating in individual and team sports. The secondary data was collected from documentation search and archives dealing with the theory of multiple intelligence and learning styles. Observation charts and athletics records were analyzed through SPSS 22 program to obtain reliability analysis, frequency and percentage values, arithmetic average values, and f test values and determine whether the students' intelligence field achievements differed according to the sports they did. The findings reveal a significant difference in the kind of sports each athlete participated in each of the intelligence aspect namely visual, affective, and bodily-kinesthetic. It was also observed that one intelligence type effective helped in developing another one as a result of application of multiple intelligence theory in their learning and curriculum.

	abstract = {Introduction: Specialized studies mention that extracurricular activities (including dance) contribute to the stimulation of multiple intelligences, on whose development the educational process and academic success depend. The aims of the study were to investigate the benefits of dancesport for the development of institutionalized children’s learning strategies, and to examine gender-dependent differences in learning strategies, as well as to formulate possible recommendations regarding the practice of dance at the age of preadolescence, from the perspective of school success vectors. Methods: Through the School Motivation and Learning Strategies Inventory (SMALSI), we could observe the changes produced in children from the initial phase to the final assessment at the end of a dancesport program. The intervention took place over a period of six months with a frequency of two lessons per week, with each lesson lasting 60 min, and aimed to increase school motivation and performance, considering the learning strategies used by institutionalized children. Thirty institutionalized children, aged 11–12 years old, participated in the research, during which they did not engage in other extracurricular physical activities. The preadolescents were assessed using the School Motivation and Learning Strategies Inventory (SMALSI). This self-report rating scale measures nine areas associated with learning strategies, six of which focus on student strengths (study strategies, note-taking/listening skills, reading/comprehension strategies, writing/research skills, test-taking strategies, and time management/organization techniques), and three are aimed at student liabilities (low academic motivation, test anxiety, and concentration/attention difficulties). Results: The results show that the biggest improvements in the case of institutionalized children were recorded for study strategies, effectiveness of test-taking strategies, and concentration difficulties. Girls registered significantly better results than boys only in the case of study strategies and for writing/research skills (Mann–Whitney test was used). Discussion: The study demonstrates the benefits of dancesport practice for the development of institutionalized children’s learning strategies, creating a foundation for the improvement of their academic performance and school integration. Conclusions: At the end of the dance program, significant improvements in academic interest were observed due to the testing strategies used. Better results were also obtained for the scales of anxiety and difficulty concentrating during tests, where average scores decreased significantly. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study aims to create a precise skin cancer classification system (SC-CS) able to distinguish various skin cancer types. Targeted categories include melanoma, vascular lesions, melanocytic nevus, cutaneous fibromas, benign keratosis, and different carcinomas and skin moles. The system employs image segmentation and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms within a double artificial multiple intelligence system (AMIS) ensemble model, optimizing results weighting for superior solution quality. Evaluation of the SC-CS involved assessing metrics like accuracy, precision, AUC, and F1-score, and gathering feedback from 31 volunteers, including dermatologists, medical professionals and other medical staff with expertise in skin cancer diagnosis. The system accurately classified varied skin cancer types using HAM10000 and malignant vs. benign datasets, chosen for their broad representation and research utility. With over 99.4% accuracy, it surpassed state-of-the-art models by 2.1% for larger and 15.7% for smaller sizes. The high system usability scale (SUS) score of 96.85% signals strong user satisfaction and recommendation potential. High data security ensured patient privacy, with no access to personal information. Uploaded data and images are promptly deleted after processing. The system aids dermatologists in accurate skin cancer diagnosis, integrating into workflows with resource requirements. Performance varies with image quality, dataset diversity, and population-specific variations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article deals with the introduction of improvisational theatre (improv) techniques into the teaching of Italian as a foreign language. The first, theoretical part introduces improvisational theatre and the main principles that improvisers use in their work. Special attention is given to the pedagogy of improvisational theatre and the effect that improv often has on the group and individ-ual. This is followed by some brief pedagogical and didactic theories that focus on the methods that are also used in improvisational theatre. These include Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, many of which are often neglected in the school environment, constructivism and its parallels to improv, but also the issues of creativity. The second part of the article focuses on practice. The techniques of improvisational theatre were used in a series of lessons at Gimnazija Ledina, a gram-mar school in Ljubljana. The aim of the research was to check the general response to the activities and the willingness to participate, as well as the impact on retention of the topics discussed. Some concrete examples are described, which can be modified based on specific contexts and needs. The last part includes some thoughts from the students and the author. At the very end of the article, the key elements that improv theatre can offer for teaching in schools, especially for Italian or other foreign languages, are mentioned. Nevertheless, there are some reservations about the study. Even if the results are not valid in every situation, the participants’ responses are a good starting point for further research in this area. © 2022, University of Ljubljana Press.

	abstract = {This study addresses the research gap in materials science by developing an integrated predictive model for Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), Maximum Hardness (MH), and Heat Input (HI) in AA-7075 Friction Stir Welding (FSW). The aim is to enhance welding procedures, particularly in high-precision industries like aerospace and automotive. By incorporating four control parameters (Tilt Angle, Rotation Speed, Welding Speed, and Shoulder Diameter) and utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model, a Heterogeneous Ensemble Machine Learning (He-EM) approach is developed. The Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) optimizes the decision fusion strategy of each technique, ensuring the model's effectiveness. Validated using diverse experimental design methods and three datasets, the proposed AMIS He-EM model outperforms existing techniques (GPR, SVM, HE-UWE, and HE-WEDE) by significant margins (35.12%, 24.92%, 22.31%, and 15.48% respectively). The model's robustness is demonstrated, as its performance remains consistent across different experimental design methods. The key finding of this research is the remarkable improvement in accuracy for predicting UTS, MH, and HI in AA7075 FSW. This study highlights the importance of incorporating four control parameters and utilizing the D-optimal design for efficient exploration of the input parameter space. The implications of this research are profound, offering opportunities to optimize welding procedures, improve product performance, and streamline manufacturing processes in industries relying on AA7075 FSW. © 2023},

	abstract = {Adaptive learning paths provide individual learning objectives that best match a learner’s characteristics. This is especially helpful when learners need to balance limited available learning time and multiple learning objectives. The automatic generation of personalized learning paths to improve learning efficiency has therefore attracted significant interest. However, most current research only focuses on providing learners with adaptive objects and sequences according to their own interests or learning goals given a normal amount of time or ordinary conditions. There is little research that can help learners to obtain the most important knowledge for a test in the shortest time possible, which is a typical scenario in exanimation‒oriented education systems. This study aims to solve this problem by introducing a new approach that builds on existing methods. First, the eight properties in Gardner’s multiple intelligence theory are introduced into the present knowledge and learner models to define the relationship between learning objects (LOs) and learners, thereby improving recommendation accuracy rates. Then, a novel adaptive learning path recommendation model is presented where viable knowledge topologies, knowledge bases and the previously‒established properties relating to a learner’s ability are combined by Dempster‒Shafer (D‒S) evidence theory. A series of practical experiments were performed to assess the approach’s adaptability, the appropriateness of the selected evidence and the effectiveness of the recommendations. In the results, it was found that the proposed learning path recommendation model helped learners learn the most important elements and obtain superior test grades when confronted with limited time for learning. © 2022, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

The study sample consisted of 123 teachers of English in Ma'an, Jordan, who were chosen randomly. Palos' and Maricutoiu's scales were used to collect data. The results of the study indicated that the average total score for the teachers' successful employment of intelligence skills was moderate, with a mean of 3.66. "Reproduction"scored high with a mean of 3.86; "analytical intelligence"scored high with a mean of 3.80; "creative intelligence"scored average with a mean of 3.64; and "practical intelligence"scored medium with a mean of 3.35. There were no statistically significant differences attributable to years of experience, while there were differences attributed to gender in favor of females in all domains except for 'creative intelligence' which was in favor of males. There were no educational level differences in the degree of "successful intelligence"employment in teaching. This calls for the need to employ modern teaching methods to develop teachers professionally, such as teaching based on reproduction, analytical, creative, and practical intelligence. The study recommends providing pre-service and in-service training to improve new teachers' competencies in employing intelligence skills based on creativity and practical teaching because they are important in teaching a foreign language. © 2022 AESS Publications.},

Therefore, this study aims to show from the perspective of the teachers the primary barriers that impede Saudi High School students from employing their MIs.

The study demonstrates how Saudi High School EFL teachers interpret the notion of MI as an educational approach. The study sample is random, comprising 100 High School EFL teachers who teach English as a Foreign language (EFL) at Dammam city in Saudi Arabia. The research is quantitative in nature and uses a five-point Likert Scale questionnaire to collect data on EFL teachers' perspectives. Results show that teachers strongly agree with the notion that MI as an educational approach may create a negative effect in the classroom if not comprehended properly, consequently raising challenges in its application in the EFL classroom. However, the MI approach is effective in language learning if its nuances are comprehended. It is expected that these results would be of use to curriculum developers and teachers training programs geared to enhance learning. © 2023, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

The generated model was utilized to anticipate three objectives based on seven controlled/input parameters. These parameters were: tool tilt angle, rotating speed, travel speed, shoulder diameter, pin geometry, type of reinforcing particles, and tool pin movement mechanism. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated using a two-experiment framework. In the first experiment, we used two newly produced datasets, (1) the 7PI-V1 dataset and (2) the 7PI-V2 dataset, and compared the results with state-of-the-art approaches. The second experiment used existing datasets from the literature with varying base materials and parameters.

	abstract = {Background. One of the challenges of contemporary education is to develop competent students who can function effectively in the increasingly competitive world. This research focuses on the study of intelligence from the perspective of Howard Gardner’s multidisciplinary perspective. Objective. This study aimed to determine and compare the level of development of multiple intelligences in engineering students at the Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá [Technological University of Panama -UTP] by faculty and major in order to provide recommendations to improve teaching methods. Method. This descriptive-comparative field research with a quantitative approach consisted of 85 students in their final year of engineering studies. They were administered a questionnaire adapted from the IAMI-R psychological instrument. After data collection, descriptive and comparative statistical analyzes were performed using Minitab. Results. The results indicate that linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences are the most prevalent in the students of the different faculties at the UTP. Conversely, bodily-kinesthetic and naturalistic intelligences are among the two least developed for 83% of the faculties, except for the Faculty of Science and Technology, where naturalistic intelligence is the third least developed. Conclusion. It is concluded that there are significant differences in the level of development of multiple intelligences between faculties and majors to which the UTP students belong. The study determines that bodily-kinesthetic and naturalistic intelligences are among the least developed. For this reason, it is recommended that the university implements activities to develop these intelligences, such as dramatization or studying body language. © 2023 Universidad Nacional.

This paper first analyzes the development of the health education concept and industry-education integration in general and discusses the health education concept and the reform of a project-based Civic Education curriculum based on industry-education integration. Secondly, based on project-based teaching and curriculum Civics, it analyzes the Civics elements of project-based teaching curriculum and the design of Civics teaching in the project-based teaching curriculum. Finally, based on the study of project-based teaching course Civics education, we analyze the course structure and course evaluation of project-based teaching course Civics education. The results show that: in the construction of the curriculum structure of the project-based teaching course Civics teaching, the setting of its professional curriculum structure does not match the current talent training objectives; 39.41% of teachers choose the curriculum structure of a single process of the subject system, 56.04% choose the curriculum structure of integration of science and practice, and only 13.56% choose the curriculum structure of combination type to meet the needs of talent training objectives. It is proved that constructing a project-based teaching curriculum integrating industry-teaching based on health education concepts can promote the transformation and development of Civic Science teaching. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC.

	abstract = {After two decades of curriculum development, integrative activity (IA) has become integral to the curriculum followed in Taiwan’s junior high schools. IA aims to engage students in courses that foster multiple intelligences; life skills; and competencies in communication, negotiation, critical thinking, and problem-solving to help them cope with overwhelming pressure. This aim aligns with the recommendations of major international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which emphasizes the importance of developing life skills in children. Pedagogical content knowledge, which was initially proposed by Shulman (1986, 1987), refers to knowledge for teaching purposes— practical wisdom that teachers internalize through dynamic pedagogical activities and processes, from class preparation and teaching to reflection. However, few studies have defined or measured junior high school teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge regarding IAs. Moreover, studies on the content or dimensions of this knowledge are rare. Therefore, in this study, we constructed the Integrative Activity Pedagogical Content Knowledge (IAPCK) scale for junior high school teachers and examined its reliability and validity on the basis of item–response theory. Moreover, we investigated whether teachers with different backgrounds perform differently on the IAPCK scale. This exploratory sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in three stages. In Stage 1, semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 IA teachers who had varying experience levels. Their practical knowledge about IAPCK was evaluated, and core themes were identified through content analysis. In Stage 3, the IAPCK scale was constructed using the results of Stage 1. A focus group was conducted to validate the content of the preliminary version of the scale. The focus group comprised five domain knowledge and teaching experts. Face validity was assessed on the basis of input from IA teachers and preservice teachers. In Stage 3, a pilot test was conducted with 176 school teachers and preservice teachers specializing in IA. A total of 591 school teachers and preservice teachers completed a survey conducted using the final version of the IAPCK scale. On the basis of a systematic review of the literature and the results of the semistructured interview, we constructed the IAPCK scale to cover the following eight dimensions: Knowledge of curriculum and objectives, knowledge of content, knowledge of instructional strategies, knowledge of instructional representations, knowledge of learners and their characteristics, knowledge of evaluation, knowledge of instructional media, and knowledge of educational contexts. The preliminary scale was subjected to item analysis; a total of 41 items were retained in the final version. An analysis performed using the multidimensional partial credit model revealed that three items were misfit for the scale; these items were subsequently deleted. The final version of the IAPCK scale comprised 38 items across eight dimensions. The item separation reliability was .992, which indicated good item separation. The person separation reliability values for the individual dimensions were as follows: Knowledge of curriculum and objectives, .89; knowledge of pedagogical content, .93; knowledge of instructional strategies, .94; knowledge of instructional representations, .93; knowledge of learners and their characteristics, .93; knowledge of evaluation, .88; knowledge of instructional media, .94; and knowledge of educational contexts, .84. These values highlight the scale’s ability to differentiate between different levels of a latent trait. Our scale demonstrated good reliability and validity, supported by substantive content and structural evidence. The results also indicated that in-service teachers performed better on the IAPCK scale than did preservice teachers, confirming the construct validity of the scale. We further investigated if teachers with different backgrounds perform differently on the IAPCK scale. The following results were obtained: 1. Male in-service IA teachers significantly outperformed female teachers; differences were observed in knowledge of instructional media. 2. No significant difference was observed among IA teachers with different education levels. 3. No significant difference was noted in IA teachers with different experience levels. 4. Significant differences were noted among teachers with different years of service in terms of their performance on various IAPCK dimensions, except for knowledge of curriculum and objectives and knowledge of pedagogical content. 5. The IAPCK performance of IA teachers with different expertise levels varied significantly, although not on each dimension, according to an F test. 6. No significant difference was observed among IA teachers employed in different districts. 7. IA teachers who had received on-the-job training on pedagogical knowledge and skills outperformed those who had never received such training. This paragraph highlights the significance of our study. First, we investigated the specific implications of IAPCK at the junior high school level. Through semistructured interviews, we deduced the distinct characteristics of IA pedagogical knowledge. Second, the IAPCK scale was developed through a systematic content analysis, which closely aligned with the practical teaching context. This approach facilitated the comprehensive representation of the characteristics of IA pedagogical knowledge. Furthermore, in contrast to previous measurement methods that solely relied on participants’ self-reported data, our approach involved an objective scoring method to evaluate teachers’ curriculum and objective knowledge as well as situational knowledge. Nonetheless, for the other dimensions of knowledge, the traditional measurement approach was used for assessing IA pedagogical knowledge: Participants completed the survey on the basis of congruence. We used the multidimensional partial credit item–response theory model for data analysis; this facilitated the establishment of the objective scale, which not only addresses the challenge of inconsistent scoring methods for different items within the scale—a problem encountered in traditional item analysis—but also ensures that the scale possesses the characteristics of equidistance and objective measurement. Third, we further confirmed that our scale has adequate item quality and good item and person separation reliability. Additionally, substantive evidence, criterion-related validity, interpretability evidence, and generalizability evidence supported the potential of the eight IAPCK dimensions in evaluating the IA pedagogical content knowledge of junior high school teachers. The IAPCK can serve as a self-evaluation tool for both preservice and in-service IA teachers. By answering questions under each dimension, teachers can monitor their IAPCK development and improve their weak areas. In addition, this scale can be used as a measurement tool in future studies. Finally, the IAPCK scale can be valuable for educational institutions—for example, during re-entry programs to assess the effectiveness of efforts investigated in enhancing re-entry education. By using a multidimensional radar chart to evaluate the performance of in-service teachers across different subject knowledge dimensions before and after their participation in a re-entry education program, the program organizers can gain insights to better align their future planning with the specific needs of the participants. This targeted and demand-driven approach would facilitate the organization of effective re-entry education programs. Nonetheless, we only conducted a preliminary overview analysis of junior high school teachers’ background information and their performance on the IAPCK scale. Further studies are needed to clarify the specific aspects of IAPCK. Future studies should include a broad range of variables and explore factors that potentially influence teachers’ performance in the IA domain. Additionally, the long-term effects of re-entry education on teachers’ instructional practices and student outcomes should be investigated to gain key insights for educational policy development and practice. © 2023, National Taiwan Normal University.

	abstract = {Introduction: Children with physical disabilities often present deficient oral hygiene and eating habits that threaten optimal oral health. Objective: To evaluate the result of a preventive program based on multiple intelligences to promote oral health care in children with physical disabilities in Chiclayo - Peru. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental, quantitative, prospective and longitudinal study was carried out from the year 2020, to test a preventive intervention based on multiple intelligences (MI), comparing it with an intervention with traditional methodology, whose purpose was in both cases promote preventive oral health care in 167 boys and girls with physical disabilities from four Special Basic Education Centers (CEBES) in Chiclayo. For the pre-and post-test evaluation using a dental record of oral hygiene practices, oral hygiene index and dietary exposure to sugary carbohydrates, the Mann Whitney U test was required, with a confidence level of 95%. Results: After not very encouraging findings in the pretest for both groups, significant changes were observed in the posttest in favor of the IM-based program, for which 58% of schoolchildren registered an adequate oral hygiene index, 69.2% brushed twice to three times a day and that only 35.8% present regular exposure to carbohydrates. Statistical significance was evidenced in favor of the MI-based intervention for the three indicated variables (ρ= 0.000). Conclusions: The application of the IM-based program achieved better results in the significant promotion of oral hygiene practices with a favorable record of the IHO and by reducing the exposure to carbohydrates in a vulnerable population. © 2023, Universidad de Concepcion.

The research objectives were to develop the multiple intelligences (MI) promotion model and an MI screening test for Thai learners and propose policies to encourage MI so that learners can reach their full potential. The sequential mixed method was applied. First, the model and the MI screening test were developed. The participants were two groups of key informants, comprising 93 and 185 participants, respectively. The sample group consisted of 460 primary and secondary school students selected through multistage random sampling. The MI screening test consisted of characteristics of 45 behavioral observations. The result showed that the developing model was the “A2D model or AAD.” This model consisted of three components: nine areas of intelligence, eight continuity mechanisms, and two success conditions. The MI screening result revealed that most learners had outstanding bodily–kinesthetic intelligence, accounting for 40.4%. The least prominent aspect was musical intelligence, representing 16.2%. The proposal policies comprised (a) The aspect of foundation for learning management with access to the A2D model, consisting of four sub-policy proposals, and (b) The aspect of encouraging learners to develop their full potential, consisting of six sub-policy proposals. © 2023 The Author(s).},

Under the background of big data, how to better integrate rural sports culture and sports tourism becomes an important issue to improve the quality of rural tourism. This paper analyzes the big data of rural sports tourism on the Internet review platform based on big data processing technology, combined with the investigation and research on the current situation of rural sports tourism resources in a town. The big data analysis shows that rural sports tourists are only 7% more female than male, and the overall gender ratio is relatively balanced. In terms of age composition, the largest number of tourists were between 36 and 45 years old, accounting for 42.6%. In addition, rural sports tourists aged 26 to 60 accounted for 82.6% of all, indicating that rural sports tourism is dominated by middle-aged and elderly people. In terms of travel time, the largest number of rural sports tourists chose 2 to 3 days, accounting for 33.8%, and only 2.3% traveled for more than 7 days. In the choice of travel mode, 37.6% of tourists are organized by travel agencies, accounting for the largest number of travelers. From the big data emotional analysis of the evaluation words of sports tourists, the most frequent occurrence is characteristic, reaching 435 times, and the least frequent is danger, but also 89 times.

However, there are some cases in which students prioritize enrolling in courses that are easy to pass. This choice results in having students with low motivation and commitment, who mainly focus on doing just enough to pass the course, missing the opportunity to boost their skills. In this study, an eclectic approach is proposed, applying a mixture of active learning methods together with the theory of multiple intelligences to improve students' performance, motivation, and commitment throughout the course. The study was applied to the 56 students enrolled in the optional Micro-Robotics Application spring course in the year 2021 at the University of Cádiz (Spain). Results demonstrate that this combination of active learning methodologies increased students' motivation, prompting them to give their best in terms of commitment, performance, and creativity. Furthermore, they were convinced that during the course they not only learned relevant robotic knowledge but also acquired essential skills needed for their future. Finally, this study highlights the benefits and future directions for implementing active learning methodologies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses. © 2023 The Authors.

An example of this is the theory of multiple intelligences (MI theory). This paper presents how a theory grounded in a Western context is locally reconceptualised by kindergarten teachers who grew up in a different context. A qualitative case study was selected to investigate seven kindergarten teachers’ understandings of MI theory in China. Three methods were employed to gather data; semi-structured interviews, field observations and documentation. Evidence from the three sources were analysed using a thematic approach. This paper reports contextual factors that had an influence on the teachers’ understandings of MI theory and thus its implementation, and argues that the introduction of new educational theories or approaches should be grounded in the local context in which the teaching will be embedded. © 2022 British Association for International and Comparative Education.},

	abstract = {With the recent advancements of learning analytics techniques, it is possible to build predictive models of student academic performance at an early stage of a course, using student’s self-regulation learning and affective strategies (SRLAS), and their multiple intelligences (MI). This process can be conducted to determine the most important factors that lead to good academic performance. A quasi-experimental study on 618 undergraduate students was performed to determine student profiles based on these two constructs: MI and SRLAS. After calibrating the students’ profiles, learning analytics techniques were used to study the relationships among the dimensions defined by these constructs and student academic performance using principal component analysis, clustering patterns, and regression and correlation analyses. The results indicate that the logical-mathematical intelligence, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation have a positive impact on academic performance. In contrast, anxiety and dependence on external motivation have a negative effect on academic performance. A priori knowledge of the characteristics of a student sample and its likely behavior predicted by the models may provide both students and teachers with an early-awareness alert that can help the teachers in designing enhanced proactive and strategic decisions aimed to improve academic performance and reduce dropout rates. From the student side, knowledge about their main academic profile will sharpen their metacognition, which may improve their academic performance. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an essential indicator for assessing water quality and managing aquatic environments, but it is still a challenging topic to accurately understand and predict the spatiotemporal variation of DO concentrations under the complex effects of different environmental factors. In this study, a practical prediction framework was proposed for DO concentrations based on the support vector regression (SVR) model coupling multiple intelligence techniques (i.e., four data denoising techniques, three feature selection rules, and four hyperparameter optimization methods). The holistic framework was tested using a data matrix (17,532 observation data in total) of 12 indicators from three vital water quality monitoring stations of the longest inter-basin water diversion project in the world (i.e., the Middle-Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China), during the year 2017 to 2020 period. The results showed that the framework we advocated for could successfully and accurately predict DO concentration variations in different geographical locations. The model used the “wavelet analysis–LASSO regression–random search–SVR” combination of the Waihuanhe station has the best prediction performance, with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.251, 0.063, 0.190, and 0.911, respectively. The combined methods using feature selection and hyperparameter optimization techniques can significantly promote the robustness and accuracy of the prediction model and can provide a new universal and practical way of investigating and understanding the environmental drivers of DO concentration variations. For the water quality management department, this proposed comprehensive framework can also identify and reveal the key parameters that should be concerned and monitored under different environmental factors change. More studies in terms of assessing potential integrated water quality risk using multi-indicators in mega water diversion projects and/or similar water bodies are required in the future. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Aim: Determine the correlation of the intrapersonal intelligence levels of nurses with their emotional contagion and caring behaviours. Background: Intrapersonal intelligence is an introverted concept that includes the capacity to understand and reflect one's self. A high level of intrapersonal intelligence contributes morally to the world and promotes success in professions with a heavy moral dimension. It is stated that emotional contagion, which is defined as the transfer of emotions and moods from one person to another, can occur in groups of two or more people. Within this context, nurses who are affected by emotional contagion may be more likely to withdraw from or desensitise to the people who cause this effect. Both situations may lead to the disruption of essential and non-deferrable care and formation of negative effects on nurses' caring behaviours. Methods: The sample of this descriptive study consisted of 257 nurses working in the Gaziantep province. A “Personal Information Form”, the “Multiple Intelligence Inventory”, the “Emotional Contagion Scale” and “Caring Behaviours Inventory” were used as data collection tools in the study. Results: It was found that the mean scores of the nurses were 39.76 ± 5.02 for Intrapersonal Intelligence, 50.09 ± 8.32 for Emotional Contagion, and 5.06 ± 0.75 for Caring Behaviours. Conclusions: It was determined that the intrapersonal intelligence levels, emotional contagion and caring behaviour levels of the nurses were above average. As the intrapersonal intelligence levels of the participants increased, so did their emotional contagion and caring behaviours. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In recent years, agriculture products have contributed to 28.75% of Thailand’s GDP. China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are the main markets for agricultural products. The annual export volume exceeds 119,222 million THB. The majority of them are shipped over Thailand’s land borders to its neighbors. Small and medium-sized farmers make up more than 85% of those who produce agricultural items. Numerous scholars have studied the transportation methods used by the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) nations along the economic corridor, but the majority of them have concentrated on import–export operations involving sizable firms, which are not applicable to the transportation of agricultural products, particularly when attention is paid to small and medium-sized farmers. In this study, mixed-integer programming (MIP) is presented to design an agricultural product logistics network. In order to prolong the lifespan of the container used, the MIP’s primary goal is to maximize the total chain profit while maintaining the lowest container usage possible. The approach was developed to increase small and medium-sized farmers’ ability to compete. Small and medium-sized farmers bring their products to an agricultural product collecting center, also known as a container loading facility. After that, skilled logistics companies distribute the goods. In order to convey the goods to the final clients in neighboring nations, the proper locations of the containing loading centers, the correct transportation option and the borders must be decided. The issue was identified as multi-echelon location–allocation sizing (MELLS), an NP-hard problem that cannot be handled in an efficient manner. To solve a real-world problem, however, efficient techniques must be supplied. AMIS, an artificial multiple intelligence system, was created to address the suggested issue. AMIS was developed with the goal of leveraging a variety of methods for local search and development. There are several well-known heuristics techniques employed in the literature, including the genetic algorithm (GA) and the differential evolution algorithm (DE). With respect to the improved solutions obtained, the computational results show that AMIS exceeds the present heuristics, outperforming DE and GA by 9.34% and 10.95%, respectively. Additionally, the system’s farmers made a total of 15,236,832 THB in profit, with an average profit per container of 317,434 THB and an average profit per farmer of 92,344.44 THB per crop. The container loading center uses 48 containers, with a 5.33 container average per container loading center (CLC). The farmers’ annual revenues were previously less than 88,402 THB per family per year, so we can predict that the new network may increase customers’ annual income by 4.459% for each crop. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Considering that academic success is one of the most important topics for medical sciences schools and faculty members, this study was conducted to determine the predictors of academic success in students of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 542 students of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The sampling method was stratified at random. The sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire, Multiple Intelligences Profiling Questionnaire (MIPQ), College Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (CASES), Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ-85PART2), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) were used to collect data. Data analysis was performed using the SPSS 16 software. The General Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the predictors of academic success. Results: According to the Pearson correlation test, there was a significant positive correlation between academic grade point average (GPA) and social support (r=0.10, P=0.048), academic self-efficacy (r=0.36, P<0.001) and there was a significant negative relationship between GPA and total mental health score (r=-0.14; P=0.003) and its subdomains including anxiety (r=-0.10, P=0.027), depression (r=-0.15, P=0.002), and social dysfunction (r=-0.12; P=0.010). According to GLM, the variables of academic self-efficacy, and level of education were among the predictors of academic success, so the GPA increased significantly with academic self-efficacy (β:0.02, P<0.001). The GPA was greater in bachelor’s students than in professional doctorate students (β:0.76, P<0.001). The significance level was considered at P<0.05. Conclusion: Due to the significant relationship between academic self-efficacy, and educational level with academic success, the promotion of self-efficacy is necessary for all students of all educational levels. © Journal of Advances in Medical Education & Professionalism.},

	abstract = {Nonvolatile optoelectronic memory (NVOM) integrating the functions of optical sensing and long-term memory can efficiently process and store a large amount of visual scene information, which has become the core requirement of multiple intelligence scenarios. However, realizing NVOM with vis-infrared broadband response is still challenging. Herein, the room temperature vis-infrared broadband NVOM based on few-layer MoS2/2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite (2D-RPP) van der Waals heterojunction is realized. It is found that the 2D-RPP converts the initial n-type MoS2 into p-type and facilitates hole transfer between them. Furthermore, the 2D-RPP rich in interband states serves as an effective electron trapping layer as well as broadband photoresponsive layer. As a result, the dielectric-free MoS2/2D-RPP heterojunction enables the charge to transfer quickly under external field, which enables a large memory window (104 V), fast write speed of 20 µs, and optical programmable characteristics from visible light (405 nm) to telecommunication wavelengths (i.e., 1550 nm) at room temperature. Trapezoidal optical programming can produce up to 100 recognizable states (>6 bits), with operating energy as low as 5.1 pJ per optical program. These results provide a route to realize fast, low power, multi-bit optoelectronic memory from visible to the infrared wavelength. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Development of complex criteria of differential express-diagnostics of pre-dosological disorders of occupational health of employees of nuclear facilities. Material and methods: The study object was male workers of the main production facilities of the Electrohimpribor Combine undergo-ing periodic medical examinations and psychophysiological examinations. The state of health was assessed according to the employee’s belonging to the dispensary observation group in accordance with Order No. 404n of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation of April 27, 2021. The psychophysiological state was assessed using a hardware-software complex for group psychophysiological examination APK PFS-CONTROL. Additional testing techniques included assessment of vibraimage parameters, evaluated using computer programs HealthTest and VibraMI, developed in ELSIS (St. Petersburg). Totally 943 man-surveys were carried out with different combination of testing methods. The average age of the workers was (42.0 ± 1.7) years, total work experience was (23 ± 1.3) years, and work experience in the specialty was (13.0 ± 1.8) years. Results: As a criteria of prenosological health disorders we used the characteristics of the worker’s adaptation to the factors of life activity. Adaptation disorders are evaluated according to three specific criteria: 1) assessment of the functional state of the cardiovascular system according to HRV data; 2) rapid assessment of the psychophysiological state according to vibraimage parameters; 3) assessment of personal and special abilities according to multiple intelligence assessment. For each of the criteria a “traffic light” of states and decisive rules of their formalized identification were developed. Characteristics of unfavorable states are given. Complex express-diagnostics of pre-dosological disorders of occupational health is carried out using integral index, which is a weighted sum of private “traffic light” indexes with a ball score. The formalized express-diagnostics of premalignant disorders is carried out using linear discriminant functions with an average recognition accuracy of 96.4 % or a probabilistic nomogram, which allows to graphically estimate the risk level of health disorders. Conclusion: Improvement of medical-psychophysiological support of employees of nuclear facilities is connected with introduction of methods and criteria of differential express-diagnosis of prenosological disorders of health. The developed criteria of express-diagnostics of pre-dosological disorders of occupational health expand the existing methodological and criteria base of periodic medical examinations of nuclear industry workers, strengthen their preventive orientation with the purpose of timely application of medical, psychophysiological, organizational and other measures on preservation and maintenance of occupational health of personnel. © 2023, A.I.

	abstract = {Objectives: In this study, elementary school subjects were classified according to ADHD clinical diagnosis criteria using Korean Children’s Panel data, and the relationship between ADHD and reading and writing ability was examined. Methods: The results of four measurement variables (multiple intelligence test, Child Behavior Checklist, and reading and writing ability evaluation) evaluated in the 8th (1st grade), 9th (2nd grade), 10th (3rd grade), and 12th (5th grade) studies during elementary school were used; for a total of 2,150 participants. In the analysis, the ADHD group was classified according to the ADHD DSM clinical standard score of the Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL 6-18), and repeated measurement and cross-analysis were conducted on the results of the reading and writing ability evaluation. Results: The ADHD Present group had lower levels of reading and writing ability than ADHD Absent group. Furthermore, it was more difficult to write than to read. There was no interaction in the change in the level of reading and writing ability according to the ADHD group. Conclusion: It may be more desirable for the ADHD Present group to be given language intervention along with treatment access to behavioral problems. However, studies on reading disorders with comorbidity of ADHD are still very rare in the field of speech-language therapy. For an in-depth understanding of speech and language development problems and ADHD, research is needed to further study the characteristics of school-age language learning disabilities and to examine the detailed characteristics of companion disabilities. © 2023, Korean Academy of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology.

Intriguingly, the study found no significant difference in critical thinking performance among the various types of intelligence. Additionally, this research posits that differential learning grounded in multiple intelligences represents a viable alternative pedagogical approach that should be earnestly embraced by educators when devising and implementing instructional strategies and methodologies.

	abstract = {A neuromyth is a commonly accepted but unscientific claim about brain function. Many researchers have claimed Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences (MI) theory is a neuromyth because they have seen no evidence supporting his proposal for independent brain-based intelligences for different types of cognitive abilities. Although Gardner has made claims that there are dedicated neural networks or modules for each of the intelligences, nonetheless Gardner has stated his theory could not be a neuromyth because he never claimed it was a neurological theory. This paper explains the lack of evidence to support MI theory. Most important, no researcher has directly looked for a brain basis for the intelligences. Moreover, factor studies have not shown the intelligences to be independent, and studies of MI teaching effects have not explored alternate causes for positive effects and have not been conducted by standard scientific methods. Gardner’s MI theory was not a neuromyth initially because it was based on theories of the 1980s of brain modularity for cognition, and few researchers then were concerned by the lack of validating brain studies. However, in the past 40 years neuroscience research has shown that the brain is not organized in separate modules dedicated to specific forms of cognition. Despite the lack of empirical support for Gardner’s theory, MI teaching strategies are widely used in classrooms all over the world. Crucially, belief in MI and use of MI in the classroom limit the effort to find evidence-based teaching methods. Studies of possible interventions to try to change student and teacher belief in neuromyths are currently being undertaken. Intervention results are variable: One research group found that teachers who knew more about the brain still believed education neuromyths. Teachers need to learn to detect and reject neuromyths. Widespread belief in a neuromyth does not make a theory legitimate. Theories must be based on sound empirical evidence. It is now time for MI theory to be rejected, once and for all, and for educators to turn to evidence-based teaching strategies. Copyright © 2023 Waterhouse.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Third molar surgery is one of the most commonly performed operations, usually associated with high anxiety. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients' anxiety would reduce if consent was modified to match their dominant intelligence type (DIT). Methods and Materials: A single center, prospective randomized clinical study was conducted in the Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of Ordu University on patients admitted for lower third molar removal between October 2020 and June 2021. The participants were randomly assigned to a study group where consent was based on DIT or a control group where consent was obtained in the standard fashion. DIT was determined using the multiple intelligence test and was further categorized as visual/spatial, verbal/linguistic, and bodily/kinesthetic. The consent method was the primary and the type of DIT was the secondary predictor variable. The primary and secondary outcome variables were the salivary cortisol level and Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) scores measured before and after the consent, and after the operation. Mann-Whitney U, Friedman, Kruskal Wallis, Pearson correlation, and χ2 tests were conducted for statistical analysis. Results: Eighty patients (55 females and 25 males; mean age 23.5 ± 6.2) were included. No significant difference was observed between the study and control groups for the change in cortisol levels and MDAS scores before-after consent (−11.15 ± 62.64; −6.84 ± 32.9) (P = .389), (−0.6 ± 3.46; −0.7 ± 2.49) (P = .832) and before consent-after operation (−39.80 ± 108.2; −39.72 ± 77.04) (P = .987), (−4.31 ± 5.97; −3 ± 4.34) (P = .867). The change in MDAS scores and cortisol levels was not correlated after consent (P = .587, r = 0.62) and operation (P = .406, r = 0.94). Conclusion: Providing consent based on DIT is not statistically different than providing consent in the standard fashion. The role of consent strategy in managing anxiety and lack of correlation between salivary cortisol and MDAS requires further investigation. © 2023 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons},

	abstract = {When practicing high-quality leader–member exchange (LMX) theory, the leader’s ability to communicate, build and maintain relationships is a vital part. Because leader–member exchange theory is a relationship-based approach to leadership that primarily includes social exchange and communication on a daily basis, we can highlight linguistic intelligence as a key leadership skill that is part of the multiple intelligences defined by Howard Gardner. The goal of this article was to conduct research into organizations where the leader applies LMX theory and examine whether the leader’s linguistic intelligence is positively related to the quality of the leader–member exchange. The dependent variable was the quality of the LMX. We were able to recruit 39 employees and 13 leaders. Correlations and multiple regressions were used to analyze our statement. The overall results are statistically significant and we conclude that there is a high positive correlation between LMX and linguistic intelligence in the organizations that were part of this study. A limitation of this study is the use of purposive sampling, which resulted in a relatively small sample size and may limit the generalization of the results to other populations. © 2023 by the authors.},

This study investigated the (possible) relationship among MI, CT, and Iranian English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ speaking skill. Seventy intermediate participants were chosen from Shahrekord University, Iran, and a language institute in Yazd, Iran. To identify the participants’ MI profiles, the Persian translation of McKenzie’s MI Inventory Questionnaire was administered to the participants. Also, to determine the participants’ CT, the Persian translation of California CT Skill Test was used. Thereafter, the participants’ speaking skill was measured by the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) speaking test. Results of the Pearson correlation coefficient showed that there was not any significant relationship between the participants’ MI and the speaking skill, whereas there was a significant relationship between their CT and speaking skill. In addition, the results revealed that, first, MI and the speaking skill did not correlate significantly and, second, the findings showed that the higher the participants were critical thinkers, the better and more fluent they were in their L2 speaking. Findings have some implications for L2 practitioners, students, administrators, and researchers in English language teaching, suggesting the incorporation of and CT skills in L2 learners’ class activities and their textbooks. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Virtualization of fossil samples and sites has been undertaken by means of phase-shift scanning, photogrammetry, and small object scanning by structured light and laser triangulation, resulting in three-dimensional virtual models of the main fossil tracks and invertebrate fossil samples. These virtual fossils have allowed the development of transdisciplinary didactic activities for different educational levels and the general public, which have been presented as file cards where the age of participants, objectives, multiple intelligences, European Union key competences, needed resources, development, and further observations are specified.

The theory of multiple intelligences (MI) is an example of one adopted. This paper reports on a study that examined factors that influence Chinese kindergarten teachers’ use of MI theory in their pedagogy. The study was a qualitative case study with seven participants from two kindergartens. Multiple methods were used to understand the contexts of these teachers’ work, their understandings and practices, and ways that they had become exposed to ideas about MI. A number of influences were apparent in shaping teacher understandings and practices. These influences at times motivated teachers to incorporate MI, but there were also instances where teachers were unsure and confused about MI and struggled to meld it with their existing beliefs and practices based on longstanding Chinese values and pedagogies. The paper argues that if the policy goal of any educational reform is to facilitate teacher change then the introduction of new educational theories or approaches should first be grounded in, and connected carefully with, teachers’ practices and, second, take careful consideration of the context in which their teaching will be embedded. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this study, 2309 students from 43 Peruvian educational institutions participated, 1174 students from the sixth grade, and 1035 students from the fifth grade. The results indicated that, in the transition from primary to secondary school, interest in mathematics decreases. Also, intelligence highly represented in sixth grade was kinesthetic and in fifth grade, intrapersonal. On the other hand, sex and socio-economic status generate differences between students who more prefer and less prefer mathematics, as well as in multiple intelligences. Finally, logical-mathematical intelligence is the main differentiating factor between students who more prefer and less prefer mathematics.

	abstract = {The question “Is the translator a creator?” has troubled translation scholars for years. This article attempts to answer this question according to the category of the Creator Model created by Howard Gardner (1993). The analysis is based on the translation biographies of three translators of William Shakespeare’s texts into Polish: Stanisław Koźmian, Leon Ulrich and Józef Paszkowski. Although they lived and translated in the same epoch, there was a lot that separated them, and an analysis of their situations using Gardner’s guidelines indicates that they can be considered Creators, because their translational paths went through the same stages as the authors of the original texts. Each of them tried to write their own texts, but it was the translation activity that gave them recognition. They came from what can now be called “middle class” families and received similar education, so their start in life was comparable. However, for each of them, the end of the translation business meant something different. Koźmian’s translations began to go unnoticed. Ulrich lost himself in the ambition to publish his own translations in a single publication, and for this reason did not work on developing his translating skills. Paszkowski had health problems and died soon, which interrupted his promising translation activity. The model proposed by Gardner makes it possible to reconstruct the translator’s path and, in the long run, to better understand the strategies and decisions that translators made. These decisions, in turn, had an impact on the enirety of the translated text, but also on the selection of specific authors and texts to be translated. © The Author(s) 2022.},

However, there appears to be paucity of research in this area of knowledge. This study, therefore, explored the application of multiple intelligences approach in the teaching of Economics. The study was a quantitative research that adopted the descriptive cross-sectional survey design. In total, 100 senior high school teachers were selected for the study. Data were collected by the use of a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, ranging from "never"to "very frequently."Descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (MANOVA) were used to analyse the data. The study revealed that Economics teachers frequently used interpersonal intelligences in teaching Economics. Additionally, it was found out that there was a statistically significant difference in the application of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence approach in the teaching of Economics based on Economics teachers' teaching experience. However, the findings of the study showed no statistically significant difference in the Economics teachers' application of MI approach in the teaching of Economics based on their gender. It was, thus, recommended that Ghana Education Service, Ministry of Education, and Non-Governmental Organisations should organise seminars and conferences for teachers to deepen their understanding of the application of the MI approach in the teaching of Economics. In addition, heads of senior high schools should organise professional development programmes and conferences to enable teachers acquire information on the following domains of MI: logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, and naturalistic intelligences.  © 2022 Mumuni Baba Yidana et al.},

The main objective of this research was to examine how the Theory of Multiple Intelligences was addressed in a seventh-grade Arabic-language textbook at the intermediate-level in Jordan and determine Arabic-language teachers' level of knowledge of applying the Theory of Multiple Intelligences in textbooks. The study used the survey method and analytical descriptive approach via content analysis and coding MI indicators in the textbook to examine the representation of MI in the textbook examined. The sample was composed of all units of a seventh-grade Arabic-language textbook. A questionnaire was distributed to 130 Arabic-language teachers. The study includes eight of the Intelligences from Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences (MI) Theory. The analysis found that the intelligences represented in the texts, activities, and exercises of the Arabic-language textbook were mostly Verbal/Linguistic, Visual/Spatial and Interpersonal intelligences, with a combined percentage of 73%. The other 27% was shared between the other intelligence types: Intrapersonal, Naturalist, Logical/Mathematical, Bodily/Kinesthetic, and Musical intelligences. A moderated awareness on how to incorporate the theory of MI in Arabic-language textbooks was found among Arabic-language teachers, which means that teachers' understanding of the importance of including MI theory in the textbook needs reinforcement and improvement. The study suggests that further research on incorporating the Theory of MI in textbooks is needed. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {In Atkins v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the execution of defendants with an intellectual disability is “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. In a 6 to 3 decision, the Court noted the increasing number of states that blocked the executions of persons with an intellectual disability, reflecting the country’s growing consensus that defendants with an intellectual disability are less culpable for their crimes than those without such a disability. Since this milestone decision, several subsequent cases have referenced this opinion. This article reviews other cases in which the execution of persons with an intellectual disability has been called into question, concluding with the Atkins-related appeal in Fuston v. State. In that case, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals considered Oklahoma statutes regarding the bright-line cutoff by which defendants meet criteria for intellectual disability, as applied to the multiple intelligence measures that were administered to Mr. Fuston. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals determined that Mr. Fuston did not meet the criteria for intellectual disability because of his performance on a single IQ measure administered when he was 12 years old, instead of the totality of his performance on subsequent intelligence measures. Mr. Fuston was also denied 14 other, unrelated propositions on appeal, and the state reaffirmed his death sentence. Implications and recommendations for forensic practice are discussed. © 2021, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. All rights reserved.},

In this research, the Tangible user interface for multiple intelligence (Tang-MI) was tested with thirty students initially evaluated for their multiple intelligences. The learners' usage behavior was observed and recorded while the students performed the assigned tasks. The behavioral data were analyzed and grouped into behaviors occurring before performing the tasks, during the tasks, and after completing the tasks. Based on the learners' usage behavior, the tangible user interface design guidelines for learners in different MI groups were proposed concerning physical equipment design, question design, interactive program design, audio design, and animated visual feedback design. These guidelines would help educators build learning games that respond to the learners' intelligence styles and enhance students' motivation to learn. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The investigation is quantitative in character, carried out via a survey, using SPSS and JASP for the data analysis. The results show that these prospective teachers feel greater rejection toward Physics and Chemistry than toward Biology and Geology (they mainly express enthusiasm for the latter). It is possible to establish differences in the emotions that the prospective teachers feel toward science depending on which path they took in their pre-university studies (Arts or Sciences). There are correlations between feeling positive emotions and having greater self-efficacy in teaching those same scientific topics. Those who feel negative emotions, such as fear or rejection, toward Physics and Chemistry have lower self-efficacy. There are correlations between having greater self-efficacy when teaching science and having a predominantly logical-mathematical intelligence. There is also a relationship between having a predominantly logical-mathematical type of intelligence and feeling more positive emotions toward sciences. Predictors of emotional dimension and self-efficacy have been also explored by multiple regression. © Copyright © 2021 Hernández-Barco, Cañada-Cañada, Corbacho-Cuello and Sánchez-Martín.},

The aim of the study was to test a concept analysis model built on the technology of mastering the key concepts of Russian culture and the theory of multiple intelligencies proposed by Howard Gardner. The three scientific approaches - emotional intelligence theory (D. Goleman), linguoconceptocentric theory (N. L. Mishatina) and classical hermeneutics (F. Schleiermacher) constitute the methodological framework of the research. From the standpoint of hermeneutics, investigating how learners understand and interpret the emotional concept 'the images of the lyrical hero and the heroine' in the prose poem "To the Memory of U. P. Vrevsky" by I. S. Turgenev highlights their progression from the formation of one emotional competence to another and finally to building and developing emotional intelligence. In the course of the hermeneutical study the lyrical hero's image is considered from the viewpoint of the emotional linguistic persona; the text of the poem is discussed as an emotiogenic text. Within the framework of laboratories-studies a system of tasks was developed to form and develop learners' emotional intelligence. The metaphors created by the teacher and the students as well as the text of a concept-centric essay comprise the results of doing the abovementioned tasks during laboratories-studies. Our data provide evidence that conceptual analysis enables learners to decode the emotional content of the author's values and implications. The development model of emotional intelligence based on hermeneutical conceptual analysis provides an opportunity to internalize and reinterpret iconic cultural texts, bridge the cultural generation gap and put Generation Z into the context of world history. © 2021 Russian Language at School.

The terminal node is equipped with a pressure sensor and attitude sensor network to collect human data, and then the terminal node sends the data to the ZigBee network. The data in the sensor network will be received by the gateway, and the data will be processed and displayed on the PC software after being received by the gateway. Finally, the data is saved to the remote server for archiving. The application of intelligent learning systems in sports makes up for many shortcomings of traditional sports. The teaching of the course consists of seven types of intelligent courses, which not only conform to the spirit of high-quality education but also combine the shortcomings of traditional physical education learning and combines several intelligent theories and the need for time development. The purpose is to develop a new sports model suitable for students' all-round development. Under the guidance of the theory of intelligent learning system, this paper establishes a new and diverse movement model, including various educational models, educational contents, educational methods, student-based learning model, and multidimensional evaluation. By comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups, the multiple intelligences physical education is more suitable for the development of modern students' various intelligences. According to the physical education learning questionnaire, students also learn more methods and contents and accept diversified teaching evaluation, which expands the development direction of students.  © 2022 Haidong Lv.},

Since the assessments are regarded as a subjective opinion of the assessor, our aim is to determine the level of certainty that we can take into account when assessing giftedness identification. In relation to that, the research is based on the validation of compliance in the giftedness assessments of schoolchildren by: teachers, parents, peers and schoolchildren’s self-assessment.The research was conducted on 115 schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The instruments for giftedness assessment were based on the theory of multiple intelligences. The instruments passed several validations, and their metric characteristics were determined. The content validity has been established, and it shows in a high-quality manner that the measuring instrument provides the possibility of appropriate measurement of multiple intelligences, while the reliability of the instrument is confirmed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The positive correlation among the perceptions of teachers, schoolchildren, peers, and the self-assessment is confirmed by Pearson’s correlation analysis. The Kruskal–Wallis test, with the Dunn’s post-hoc test, indicates that there is a high congruence between the assessments of all four groups of assessors. The greatest agreement in assessments was found in musical intelligence, whereas the greatest differences in assessments were detected in the combination of parents with other assessors. The findings in this research will be used for creating a software for giftedness assessment. © 2020 European Council for High Ability.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to clarify the relationship between multiple intelligence (MI) and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. It discusses to what extent each dimension of MI is considered as an activation driver of entrepreneurial opportunities recognition. This paper also aims to expand the domain of entrepreneurial opportunities recognition via MI by considering the mediating role of neuromarketing perception, adopting a combined perspective of intelligence, entrepreneurship and also neuromarketing to provide a future direction for the creation of interdisciplinary insights in the area of entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: This paper opted for literature synthesis to define key concepts surrounding MI and entrepreneurial opportunities recognition. Besides, it also attempted to identify an influential mediator in explaining the entrepreneurial opportunities recognition phenomenon. Consequently, this paper identified the gaps in current research to draw upon a more holistic conceptual framework. The rationale for the research was justified within the body of research. Findings: This paper suggested research propositions based on the literature synthesis in view of MI and entrepreneurial opportunities recognition. More specifically, it has proposed a conceptual framework, explaining the relationship between a multi-dimensional view of both MI and entrepreneurial opportunities recognition. It is envisaged that the mediating role of neuromarketing perception incorporated in this conceptual work will improve the predictive value of the proposed framework and offer additional insights about factors that advance entrepreneurial opportunities recognition. Research limitations/implications: This paper suffers from the obvious limitation of lacking empirical investigation. However, it does provide a theoretical rationale for the argument that entrepreneurial opportunities recognition can be advanced if MI are identified and associated with neuromarketing dimensions. Perhaps the most important direction for future research is further extension and validation of this framework by performing an empirical investigation to produce newer insights into this phenomenon. Originality/value: This conceptual work is different from previous studies on the grounds it has considered unexplored issues in explaining entrepreneurial opportunities recognition. To bridge the critical knowledge gap of the entrepreneurial opportunities recognition phenomenon, a mediating effect of neuromarketing perception is also integrated within the model. The proposed model was neither formulated nor tested empirically in previous studies locally or perhaps globally, therefore it stands out as an original contribution incorporating MI and entrepreneurial opportunities recognition phenomenon while considering the brain activity through neuromarketing perception. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: This study aimed to examine the relationship between cognitive behavioral physical activity and multiple intelligence levels of athletes in different team sports. Methods: The sample of the study consisted of 518 athletes dealing with different team sports. As a data collection tool, “Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Scale” developed by Schembre et al. (2015) and adapted into Turkish by Eskiler et al. (2016), and “Multiple Intelligence Scale” developed by Gardner (1990) and adapted into the Turkish Selçuk et al. (2003), were used. In the analysis of the data, it was determined that the data did not show normal distribution as a result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and non-parametric analysis was used. Mann-Whitney U test was used for paired comparisons and the Kruskal Wallis-H test was used for multiple comparisons. Results: It was determined that female athletes had higher result expectation from cognitive behavioral physical activity sub-dimensions, while males’ personal disabilities were higher than female. When multiple intelligence levels were examined, although the logical intelligence levels of male were higher than female, it was found that their kinesthetic intelligence levels were higher. Also, when compared according to sports branches, it was found that the logical intelligence levels of basketball players were higher than futsal players. Finally, when the relationship between the cognitive behavioral physical activity levels of athletes and multiple intelligence sub-dimensions was examined, it was found that there was a positive relationship between cognitive behavioral physical activity and intelligence types. These results showed that as the level of cognitive behavioral physical activity increased, the mean that individuals can obtain from the multiple intelligence scale can increase. Conclusion: These results suggested that especially sedentary individuals should be directed to physical activities starting from adolescence. Thus, they can contribute to the development of multiple intelligences. © Mattioli 1885},

	abstract = {In sustainable education, it is important to analyze student diversity in order to create strategies that allow for the implementation of inclusive education based on the differences observed among students. To achieve this, a sample of 321 first-year engineering students (107 females and 214 males) at a private university in northeast Mexico was analyzed during the 2020 academic year. Students were classified according to their gender, engineering program, and the development of their multiple intelligences according to Howard Gardner theory of multiple intelligences. To verify the effect of gender and program factors on the development of multiple intelligences, Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed with α = 0.05. The analysis of the effects of gender identified significant differences in four intelligences: linguistic and interpersonal (for which the female students obtained higher mean scores) and mathematical and visual (for which the male students obtained higher mean scores). The analysis of the effects of the engineering program identified significant differences in five intelligences: mathematical, visual, and musical (for which civil engineering students obtained a higher mean score than the students in the other programs); kinesthetic (for which computer science students obtained a lower mean score than students in the other programs); and naturalistic (for which sustainability engineering students obtained a higher mean score than students in the other programs). These differences allowed us to observe the characteristics of the students and to develop more inclusive courses in order to make the teaching and learning process more optimal and sustainable. © 2022 by the authors.

The sample consist of 577 participants of undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Jaen (Spain). The results obtained allow us to establish important points for reflection, such as the concept of neurodidactics in the university context, simplified to neurotransmitters, brain areas or multiple intelligences, as well as reducing inclusion to the existence of students with disabilities in the classroom, or to a sustainability that is not considered a driver of change in the current educational system. The conclusion obtained from SEM modeling is the existence of a very strong relationship among neurodidactics and educational inclusion, and the latter with sustainability, while there is a low relationship between neurodidactics and sustainability.

Measuring information intelligence is very important in information societies. Addressing the effective indicators in this issue is one of the determining issues in the use of information and data in information societies. The present study aimed to identify indicators and measures effective in measuring information intelligence. The research is applied and uses a qualitative method including library studies, content analysis, and analysis of expert opinions. Data collection tools included the study of scientific literature related to the subject, content-coding, and interviews with experts familiar with the subject of information intelligence (8 experts in knowledge and information science and 7 experts in psychology). The research population included related published literature related to scientific theories, information science experts, and psychology experts. In the subject of intelligence, Gardner’s multiple intelligence theory has been used, and in the subject of information-seeking behavior various scientific theories have been used. Based on the research findings, 14 indicators and 97 measures were identified as effective for measuring information intelligence in two dimensions management and information retrieval. Finally, a proposed framework is presented for measuring information intelligence. From the findings, it was concluded that in the information society, policymakers and managers of the organization or responsible organizations in relation to increasing the level of information intelligence of the society should consider the specific strategies of the information intelligence of the society in formulating their general strategies. One of these strategic goals can be increasing the level of information intelligence of individuals, organizations, and society. To do this, effective indicators must be identified for measuring and strategies to increase the level of information intelligence of the target community. It is suggested that this matter is placed in the priorities of the information society and the native measurement tool of information intelligence can be prepared based on the findings of this research. © 2022 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

The research was conducted in the screening model and experimental design. The study group consisted of 477 primary schools first grade students (6 years old). Data collection tools are as follows, Brigance K & 1 Screen II scale, Goodenough-Harris draw-a-person test, Teele Multiple Intelligence Preference Inventory (TIMI), Enrichment Program Pre-test-Post-test, and "Project Evaluation Criteria List." After the screening process, a class-wide enrichment program based on multiple intelligence was applied to gifted and talented children and their classmates. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the data at hand. The findings of the study revealed that Brigance K & 1 Screen II scale was effective in determining gifted children attending the first grade of primary school with a rough evaluation. The enrichment program results were different from the existing school program in favor of enrichment. The class-wide enrichment program has improved all children, with a more potential for gifted children. As a part of the program, a total of 163 students were given project assignments. At the end of the evaluation, it was determined that the students improved in multiple intelligence areas. © 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz. All rights reserved.},

A point of concern is that the term LS has been used within theories that describe them using completely different notions and categorisations. This is the first empirical study to investigate education professionals’ conceptualisation, as well as means of identifying and implementing LS in their classroom. A sample of 123 education professionals were administered a questionnaire consisting both closed- and open-ended questions. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. LS were found to be mainly conceptualised within the Visual-Auditory-(Reading)-Kinaesthetic (VAK/VARK) framework, as well as Gardner’s multiple intelligences. Moreover, a lot of education professionals confused theories of learning (e.g., behavioural or cognitive theories) with LS. In terms of identifying LS, educators reported using a variety of methods, spanning from observation and everyday contact to the use of tests. The ways LS were implemented in the classroom were numerous, comprising various teaching aids, participatory techniques and motor activities. Overall, we argue that the extended use of the term LS gives the illusion of a consensus amongst educators, when a closer examination reveals that the term LS is conceptualised, identified and implemented idiosyncratically by different individuals. This study aims to be of use to pre-service and in-service teacher educators in their effort to debunk the neuromyth of LS and replace it with evidence-based practices. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The virtual simulation technology is integrated into the traditional IoT teaching, and the professional education of IoT application technology is tapped; from the analysis of the current situation of IoT skills teaching and the feasibility of carrying out virtual simulation teaching, the "four-driven"design principle is proposed, and the teaching design is combined with the virtual simulation technology teaching, and the case design of the skill-based virtual simulation technology teaching of experience, demonstration, interaction, and assessment in the virtual environment is given. This paper presents the case design of virtual simulation teaching in a virtual environment with experience, demonstration, interaction, and assessment, and the multidimensional effect evaluation of IoT skills teaching and researches the application of virtual simulation to IoT skills teaching through the above four aspects. In this paper, a framework for distributed collaborative computing is built using an asynchronous message queue MQ, which enables multiple nodes to serve a task through task splitting. The DeepCluster module can effectively cluster the time series by deep representation learning and obtain the typical variation of time series patterns. In the task offloading module of the framework, a task offloading decision algorithm based on a value-constrained multi 0-1 backpacking model is designed to minimize task processing latency with an optimal offloading solution. The system test results show that the proposed distributed computing framework and offloading decision algorithm can significantly reduce the processing latency of large tasks.  © 2022 Yang Ning.},

However, the effectiveness of UDL and MI in supporting inclusive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has never been tested empirically. This study examined the impact of the UDL-MI-oriented STEM program on eighth-grade rural students’ attitudes towards STEM through mixed research design. A total of 122 students were selected through purposive sampling and randomly distributed into experimental (N = 62) and control groups (N = 60). The experimental group experienced STEM learning through the UDL-MI-oriented program and the control group received traditional classroom teaching. Both groups studied learning units on environmental sustainability and conservation for 10 weeks. Changes in students’ attitudes towards STEM were assessed over the time period (pre-test, post-test, follow-up) using an adapted Mahoney Student Attitude toward STEM instrument and individual interviews (post-test, follow-up). The results indicated that in comparison to the traditional classroom, the UDL-MI-oriented program significantly improved and maintained the students’ attitudes towards STEM. Next, the qualitative findings were presented to support the statistical analyses. This study provides empirical evidence for adopting the UDL-MI-oriented STEM program as an effective way of providing inclusive STEM education to rural students by enhancing their attitudes towards STEM. © 2021 by the authors.

As a result of various challenges raised by the global economy, the dramatic acceleration of global collaboration in the field of information and communication technology, many of the South Asian countries are facing "policy paralysis."To meet the challenges confronted by the youth and adult learners of these countries and fulfill their expectations and enhance the quality of education, there must be a new paradigm in education beyond the multiple intelligences. Hence, higher education in South Asian countries should seek a new paradigm. This new paradigm, which is a step ahead of multiple intelligence, urges the development of contextualized multiple intelligence of tertiary students so that they become Contextualized Multiple Intelligent (CMI) leaders. A literature review has been carried out to identify the pedagogy needed to solve the key challenges related to quality education. An effort is also made to explore the possibilities, challenges, and practical ways of transforming educational research into a more sensitized one with social and contextual accountability. The exploration and the inputs derived from this will lay a new pathway to the higher education systems of South Asian countries. © 2022 Common Ground Research Networks, Jijo Varghese, M. N.

	abstract = {The last decade has been the theater of the rapidly growing introduction of information technology (IT) into the classroom, prompting teachers to embrace this change in their routine. Unfortunately, university training and school administrations are slow adherents. Although all teachers use a mobile phone for their personal needs, some may still be reluctant to use IT at large in the classroom. The digital literacy (DL) has been reported to be related to five capacities: Information processing, communication, content creation, safety, and problem solving. It is thus important to have a better understanding of the extent of DL of the teachers, among these dimensions. Among the potential explanation for differences observed in the degree of mastering of IT, some research points on the possible impact of dominant style of intelligence. This paper reports on an exploratory survey to determine the actual level of DL of teachers, measured with different approaches, and to verify whether there is a relationship between DL and intelligence style. It also studies the relationship between the different components of literacy, digital skills and whether there is an important link between different types of intelligence. Findings show that respondents are moderately digital literate/competent, strong in Existential and Intrapersonal Intelligences. In addition, results show the correlations between Intrapersonal Intelligence and Safety, Content Creation, and Communication, while Musical Intelligence is significantly correlated with Problem Solving.  © 2021.

	abstract = {Differentiation has become an indispensable teaching approach to meet the needs of diverse learners, and has thus garnered a lot of attention, particularly on a theoretical level. This has resulted in an abundance of differentiation models and frameworks. Despite the attention given to differentiation, most teachers still seem to struggle with implementing it in practice. The previous models have therefore failed to provide teachers with a clear and easy-to-use framework for differentiation. For this reason, we have created the 5-dimensional (5D) model of differentiation which aims to be a more accessible and tangible model than the existing ones. The model approaches differentiation through five dimensions, which are 1) teaching arrangements, 2) learning environment, 3) teaching methods, 4) support materials and 5) assessment. The model draws on constructivism, Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), Theory of Multiple Intelligences and motivation as its core theoretical underpinnings. The model stems from the Finnish educational context but can be transferred to and applied in various school contexts. In this article, we will first review various definitions of differentiation. We will then critically examine some of the existing models for differentiation. Finally, we will elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings and different dimensions of our 5D model. © 2021.

A total of 121 students from four eighth-grade science classes participated in this study. The experimental group of students (N=61) learned a unit of structure of matter in inclusive science classrooms in which theory of multiple intelligences (MI) was used as a mediator, aligned with the principles of Universal Design for Learning, to differentiate instructional strategies, assessment approaches and types of assignments, incorporating all students’ strengths or intellectual profiles, while the control group of students (N=60) learned the same unit in traditional science classrooms. Changes in students’ attitudes towards science over the time period (pre-test, post-test, and follow-up) were assessed using a Likert-scale questionnaire and individual interviews. The results of statistical analysis indicated that compared to traditional classroom, inclusive classroom using MI-inspired lessons significantly improved and maintained the students’ attitudes towards science. The quantitative results were further supported by evidence from qualitative data gathered through post and follow-up interviews. This study has implications for the nature of inclusive practices in science classrooms concerning the value of students’ attitudes towards science. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, the existing educational programs in academic institutions tend to overlook this aspect of training but focus instead on IT capabilities. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis on some multiple intelligences (emotional intelligence, social intelligence and cultural intelligence) of IT/IM students in international scale. The evaluative instrument was reviewed by the scholars in information management research domain and further examined in pre-test interviews prior to the formal administering of the questionnaires to students in the three countries. According to the results of analysis, the differences in emotional intelli gence and social intelligence of subjects are significant. However, there is no significant difference in cultural intelligence and emotional intelligence. The findings of this investigation will contribute toward the formulation of future educational programs and selection of IT personnel by corporations when dealing with cross-cultural education and employment. © Journal of Management World, 2021.

	abstract = {This paper shows an analysis of the entrepreneurship intentions patterns in the short, medium, and long term of Mexican university students. The entrepreneurship patterns analysis was carried out using a customized artificial neural network considering as inputs the self-assessment of multiple intelligences from an interdisciplinary perspective. Thus, many important findings reveal that not all multiple intelligences have a direct and proportional impact on entrepreneurship intention. In fact, Linguistic–Verbal Intelligence, Intrapersonal Intelligence, and Interpersonal intelligence are the types of intelligence that have the greatest influence on entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, the performance metrics of the ANN for classifying the entrepreneurship intentions are higher than the ones reported in the literature (i.e., accuracy ≈ 99.29%, precision ≈ 98.89%, sensitivity ≈ 99.53%, and specificity ≈ 99.01%). The paper contributes to the literature on the deep understanding of entrepreneurs’ behavior concerning the strengths and weaknesses of their multiple intelligences. Besides, this interdisciplinary empirical work contributes to improving the design of methods and techniques to strengthen entrepreneurship from the earliest stages of students’ lives and promote sustainable businesses. The most surprising finding was the minimal relationship of Naturalistic Intelligence to undertake sustainable and robust projects, which demands more detailed and in-depth analysis. Finally, some proposals are presented to improve the teaching process of entrepreneurship and sustainability, considering the artificiality, sustainability, and entrepreneurship involved in academic programs at universities. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Learning assessment is a pedagogical reality such as in teaching professional education courses with preservice education students. Assessment problems like horrifying and boring test papers must be addressed because these cause trauma to learners. Using an Action Research Method, I subjected my test materials to democratic critiquing and enhancement process, taking-into account the experiences of my learners and the viewpoints of my colleagues as my study participants. Said materials were utilized as my pedagogical action to address student assessment animosity. The results made me discern that though the contents of my test papers were aligned with the learning outcomes defined by the Commission on Higher Education, they were merely words and sentences in monotone appearance and thus, not eye-catching. Consequently, I crafted a Holistic Written Assessment Guide (HWAG) ensuring in test paper construction the pedagogical values of multiple intelligences, learning taxonomies, grammar review necessity, proper coverage and level of difficulty sequencing and marking, and time-number of items balance. Utilizing this new form and substance of my learning assessment material and engaging with it turned out to be liberating thus mutual healing to me as a transformed purveyor of education, to my students as healthy collaborators, creators and ultimate beneficiaries of learning, and to educators in the global environment as inspirers of democratic, equitable, and lifelong education. With this mutuality, this paper potentially enables leaders of nations to engage in the transformation of the pedagogical landscape. © 2022, Verlag Barbara Budrich. All rights reserved.},

We hypothesized that the success of previous programs based on the same foundations would generalize to Omani students. In an experiment, the experimental group received a special training and the control group did not. We then checked whether the pretest-posttest gain was larger for the experimental group than for the control group.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the predispositions of the studied groups of students to work in the IT sector. The basis for predisposition assessment was their voluntary self-assessment of certain preferences, which are related to the theory of multiple intelligences of Professor Gardner. The study was conducted on a reference group of IT sector employees, assuming that they will be the model, to which the results of the study will be related. The method used to obtain data about the students’ predispositions was a test carried out in an auditorium mode or online. More than 500 students from several countries were surveyed and interesting statistical material was obtained allowing for comparison between groups. The most important result was to find a way to sort the students into groups in order from most similar in their aptitude to the market pattern to least. This made it possible to determine the boundary beyond which students could be considered selected for a job in the IT sector. Statistical hypotheses about the similarity of the student groups to the reference group were verified. The results were both positive, confirming that a large percentage of students have predispositions to work in the IT market, and less promising. The authors are convinced that the method can be applied all over the world, as they examined groups in very diverse countries, taking into account, for example, location, education system, culture or religion. © 2022 Vilnius University, ETH Zürich},

With the continuous innovation and development of science and technology, the teaching mode and teaching system have also ushered in new changes. How to let students understand the process of music teaching and better appreciate the charm of music is the main problem faced by educators. Faced with the above situation, starting from the theory of multiple intelligences, this paper studies the innovation and discrete dynamic modeling of music teaching mode in colleges and universities. Firstly, this paper discusses the application effect of this method in music teaching based on the theory of multiple intelligences. This paper investigates the actual development of multiple intelligences theory in college music teaching. Combined with the characteristics of multiple intelligences theory, modeling and analysis of students' interest changes in the intelligent music education model represented by the space vector model are carried out. Finally, this paper studies the discrete dynamic modeling of students' learning effect after the optimization and innovation of music teaching mode in colleges and universities under the theory of multiple intelligences. The results show that in the innovation of music teaching mode, personalized learning services should be provided based on students' interests. The theory of multiple intelligences can help teachers to effectively analyze the diversity characteristics and changes of students in teaching activities, and it is of great help to improve students' musical performance.  © 2022 Chen Yi.},

The present research involved the design of a STEAM contest that focuses on having students use hand tools to produce three miniature models in the morning and then use these models to compete in relay races and tug-of-war contests in the afternoon. They were required to rely on their intelligence practice without the assistance of teachers or parents. Thus, this research aimed to explore the correlates between students’ object-free (bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, logical) and object-related (naturalistic) intelligences, and their hands-on making self-efficacy (HMSE) reflected in their attitude toward quality improvement (ATQI) when participating in a STEAM contest. Data were collected from 330 junior high school students on the day of the STEAM competition and were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the students’ 4 types of multiple intelligences were positively related to HMSE. Consequently, HMSE was positively related to ATQI. The results imply that ATQI was essential for students to win in the STEAM contest, which benefited those students with a high level of the 4 types of intelligence mediated by HMSE. © 2020, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.},

There is a need for a teaching methodology on how to deliver STEM contents to every student in Mongolia. Method: This study developed a differentiated teaching approach based on nine multiple intelligence and learning style differences. To create the teaching approach, first, the study had the Gardner test and Visual, Authority, Kinesthetic (VAK) behavior test among 76 students. Findings: This study found a proper modification teaching approach for the intelligent ability and learning styles. Implications for Research and Practice: After implementation of the modification, the academic achievement and engagement of the students increased by 9.3 percent. The study findings reveal correlations between VAK, Intelligence ability, and temperaments of the students. These relationships can be used for teaching STEM and preparation classes. © 2022 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, the need of effective and high-quality PLEs and ALEs has emerged but developing such learning environments has some difficulties such as the need for a huge number of qualified e-contents. Generation of e-contents for these systems is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover, presenting the same e-content for each student is not effective because each student can have different intelligence type. To overcome these problems, low cost, reusable and dynamic e-contents can be used for PLE and ALE systems. For this purpose, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to provide sequenced e-contents for PLE and ALE systems. This proposed system was used in a case study to investigate its impact on learning process. The performance of the proposed study was compared with analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which is another multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, also further statistical analyses were investigated. The results showed that 84.6% of students showed interest in the proposed system, so the FAHP method can be used for presenting personalised e-content effectively. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Its psychometric properties were examined with a Taiwanese sample. The Gold-MSI inventory was translated into Chinese following recommendations from the literature on cross-cultural test development. Subsequently, the psychometric properties of the Chinese Gold-MSI self-report inventory, including the Melody Memory Task and the Beat Alignment Perception Task, were evaluated using an online survey with 1,065 participants. Results of confirmatory factor analysis suggest that the original factor structure of the Gold-MSI inventory showed an acceptable fit with the data from the Chinese-speaking sample. In addition, the Chinese Gold-MSI inventory shows good reliability. The Melody Memory Task and the Beat Alignment Perception Task also have sufficient test-retest reliability. Finally, correlations between the Chinese Gold-MSI inventory and the Musical-Rhythmic Intelligence subscale of the Eight Multiple Intelligences Questionnaire as well as the two additional music tests provide evidence for convergent and divergent validity. Overall, the data suggest that the Chinese Gold-MSI has good psychometric properties. Percentile norms for the Gold-MSI inventory and the music tests from the present sample are reported for use in future studies. The present study thus makes a valuable contribution to cross-cultural research in music psychology by enabling the comparison between Chinese and Western studies of individual differences in musical ability. © The Author(s) 2019.},

In this study, I show that while experts criticize genetic talent testing as unscientific, the persistence of genetic talent testing is not merely a product of parents’ scientific illiteracy. Instead, genetic talent testing reflects parents’ pragmatic use of technology in response to the parenting pressures in contemporary China. Parents see the results of genetic talent testing as offering an advantage for their children when combined with the intensive parenting strategy of precision education. Drawing on the sociology of testing, I argue how genetic talent testing in China is a product of broader concerns about population quality and can potentially reshape how parents imagine quality children through the theory of multiple intelligences. My study of this “off label” use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing also suggests that scientists need to broaden their imagination of potential misuses of their technologies. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Despite the breadth and depth of educational neuroscience research and teachers’ interest in neuroscience, teachers often have limited access to reputable sources. As a result, neuromyths–misapplied or over-simplified claims related to brain science–have proliferated. School Psychologists have training in education, applied neuroscience, and evidence-based practices. As such, school psychologists are poised to mitigate the negative impact of teacher neuromyth endorsement. This study examined the endorsement rate of neuromyths by teachers to identify knowledge gaps to inform future training in this area. In-service and preservice teachers from grades K-12 completed an online survey of common neuromyths. Many neuromyths are pernicious and continue to be endorsed by teachers, most commonly related to learning styles and multiple intelligences. These results support the need for increased training in neuroscience for teachers and suggest a desire for factual and useful information about educational neuroscience, which school psychologists can provide in educational contexts. © The Authors 2020.},

	abstract = {Despite evidence from cognitive psychology that men and women are equal in measured intelligence, gender differences in self-estimated intelligence (SEI) are widely reported with males providing systematically higher estimates than females. This has been termed the male hubris, female humility effect. The present study explored personality factors that might explain this. Participants (N = 228; 103 male, 125 female) provided self-estimates of their general IQ and for Gardner’s multiple intelligences, before completing the Cattell Culture Fair IQ test as an objective measure of intelligence. They also completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) as a measure of sex-role identification, and measures of general and academic self-esteem. Both gender and sex-role differences were observed for SEI, with males and participants of both genders who scored high in masculinity offering higher self-estimates. By comparing estimated and observed IQ, we were able to rule out gender differences in overall accuracy but observed a pattern of systematic underestimation in females. An hierarchical multiple regression showed significant independent effects of gender, masculinity, and self-esteem. Mixed evidence was observed for gender differences in the estimation of multiple intelligences, though moderately sized sex-role differences were observed. The results offer a far more nuanced explanation for the male hubris, female humility effect that includes the contribution of sex role identification to individual and group differences.

For this purpose, an action research design was adopted and the study was conducted with 39 pre-service science teachers. The study lasted for 9 weeks and 36 hours within the scope of “Special Teaching Methods-I“ course. The Science Application Test (SAT) was used in the data collection process. There were seven open-ended questions in the SAT, in which preservice science teachers were asked to design student-centered activities (e.g. argumentation, context-based learning, 5E model, cooperative learning, the theory of multiple intelligences, experiment) related to teaching models, methods and techniques used in science. In the analysis of the data obtained, content analysis was performed and themes and codes were created. Accordingly, there are four themes: “design activities”, “acquisition”, “content” and “relevance”. In each of these themes, three codes were analyzed according to a total of 12 codes. In the research process, firstly, the researcher explained the student-centered science teaching models, methods and techniques to the preservice science teachers, and then the pre-service teachers applied on each subject. After the in-class studies completed, the SAT was applied and preservice science teachers’ ability to design activities was revealed. Accordingly, the activities designed by preservice science teachers were high in “acquisition” and “content” themes and low in “design activities” and “relevance” themes. Within the framework of the results obtained from the research, various suggestions were made to increase the preservice science teachers’ skills to design activities. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {This article is a historical examination of how Western theorists created and utilized the intelligence concept and aligned it with racial classification to determine cognitive abilities. By the 1900s, Western theorists, without evidence, declared that intelligence exists as an inheritable, unchangeable mental condition. Influential Western theorists have exploited the intelligence concept to categorize the cognitive abilities of European descendants above that of non-Whites, particularly African-descended people as incessant deliberations emerged regarding the value of either cognitively superior or inferior racially defined groups. By interrelating geographical location with shared physical characteristics, Western theorists non-scientifically divided the human family based on physical similarities among people and referred to them as races. These theorists incorporated the intelligence concept with racial classification as a sociological principle for educational development. According to the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, however, everyone has one or more forms of several intelligences. Although this theory appears to portray a different understanding from the original intelligence concept, it categorizes racial groups and individuals as having fixed levels of cognitive ability. Emphasizing intelligence as a descriptive factor to determine cognitive ability is an unscientific, unequitable characterization that has been employed to explain levels of social awareness and academic performance in Western education. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The present study therefore aims to determine the association of vitamin D status with the different domains of intelligence among Saudi Arabian adolescents. This study used relational survey method among 1864 Saudi adolescent, including 549 boys and 1315 girls (mean age 14.7 ± 1.7 years) recruited using a multistage, stratified cluster randomization of 47 public and private schools in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. A general questionnaire was used to collect demographic information. Intelligence was assessed using multiple intelligence inventory. Anthropometrics were measured and fasting blood samples collected for assessment of glucose and lipid profile. Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50 nmol/L) was observed in 84.2% of boys and 93.5% of girls. Girls had higher levels of verbal, kinesthetic, musical, naturalist and existential intelligence than boys, while boys have higher logical intelligence than girls (p-values < 0.05). Mixed regression analysis controlled for age, BMI and sex revealed that kinesthetic intelligence was significantly associated with 25(OH)D in boys (β 5.6 (2.8–8.5; p < 0.001)) and inversely associated with musical intelligence (β −1.2 (−2.3–0.1; p = 0.03)) and positively with naturalist (β 2.3 (0.5–4.2; p = 0.01)) in girls. Vitamin D status is associated with several domains of intelligence in adolescents and is sex-specific. Development a specific domain of intelligence may indirectly affect vitamin D status among adolescents, but needs to be proven prospectively. © 2021 by the authors.

A quasi-experimental design that adopted pretest, posttest, and control group was used for the study. Stratified and simple random sampling techniques were used to select four schools from forty-four public primary schools in Calabar. One hundred and twenty (primary IV) pupils, comprising three intact classes, were used for the study. Basic science achievement test (BSAT) and verbal/quantitative reasoning ability test (V/QRAT) were the instruments used to collect data. Split half reliability coefficient for BSAT and V/QRAT were 0.85 and 0.91, respectively. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed for data analyses, and the hypotheses were tested at p < 0.05 level of significance. The major finding revealed by the study was that pupils who were taught basic science with multiple intelligences teaching strategies performed better than those taught by the direct instruction method. The study recommends the adoption of multiple intelligences teaching strategies in teaching basic science in schools. These instructional strategies would help to improve pupils’ academic achievement significantly. © Common Ground Research Networks, Catherine Boniface Ekarika, Maureen Okang Okon, Rose Unwanung Adie, Mabel Obioma Ajah, Samuel Eburu Odey, Some Rights Reserved.},

This study aims to determine: (1) a description of the profile and abilities of multiple intelligences of basic education tutors at UPBJJ UT Pekanbaru; and (2) differences in multiple intelligences based on gender, occupation, number of institutions, age, years of service, and ethnicity. This study uses a quantitative approach through a survey method, with a sample of 193 taken through a random sampling technique. All data were collected via online questionnaires and quantitatively analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 application and the Two-Way Anova test. The results showed that: (1) the aspect of multiple intelligences, research subjects regularly have good multiple intelligences (min = 6.7); (2) there is no difference in multiple intelligences based on gender, occupation, number of institutions, age, tenure, and ethnicity; and (3) there is a relationship between physical/kinesthetic, existential/spiritual, interpersonal, intrapersonal, logical/mathematical, musical/rhythmic, naturalistic, verbal/linguistic, and visual/spatial.

In so doing, the study utilized an experimental design with 10 participants in the control group and 20 participants in two experimental groups. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative analysis, the results indicate that, over six months, the use of the multiple intelligences teaching approach contributed to a significant improvement in the learners’ multiple intelligences. The implementation was also successful in raising the learners’ classroom engagement. Further, comparing the first language (Persian) & second language (English) multiple intelligences-based instruction, L2 (English) multiple intelligences-based instruction was more effective in fostering physically disabled learners’ multiple intelligences and classroom engagement. © 2021 The Author(s).

The non-experimental design consisted of a descriptive, correlational, and comparative study of two groups (Spanish and Colombian students). At the descriptive level, the sample attained medium and medium-high levels on all variables. We found relationships between most of the variables analyzed. In terms of the comparison made, Colombian students achieved higher levels in performance on the degree of reorganization of reading information and creativity. In contrast, Spanish students scored higher on literal, critical, and inferential understanding.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on socio-emotional competencies of a physical education intervention (i.e., the MooN program) based on the instructional model known as the sports education model (SEM), compared to a physical education intervention based on the traditional model of direct instruction (TM-DI) in preadolescents. The sample consisted of 170 students between 10 and 13 years old (mean age: M = 10.76; standard deviation: SD = 0.73). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (SEM; n = 87) and the active control group (TM-DI; n = 83). In the experimental group, the SEM-based intervention was applied, while in the active control group, an intervention based on the TM-DI was developed. A quasi-experimental design with repeated pre-test and post-test measures and an active control group was used. The self-efficacy inventory for multiple intelligences (IAMI-40) was used to assess the children’s socio-emotional competencies. The child perfectionism inventory was applied to evaluate the self-demand perfectionist efforts. The results confirmed that the MooN program (SEM intervention) promoted significant improvements in socio-emotional competencies. These findings support the potential of this physical education instructional model as an emotional education pathway for the socio-emotional improvement of preadolescent students. © 2021 by the authors.

Second, our E-MOTION method traces visitors’ paths in the museum linked to their declared level of emotions. In doing this, the method creates an emotion-map of a visitor’s journey in the museum. The two methods identify museum features conducive to sense-making, which can be linked to Gardner’s (1993) multiple intelligences, and to disengaging ‘sense-wrecking’. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The progress of neuroeducation in recent years has had an impact on the current understanding of education. As an interdisciplinary science, neuroeducation has provided great advantages over the description of neural correlates in the teaching-learning process, as well as in the detection of neuromyths. However its contributions are not lacking in a critical review from a philosophical perspective that goes beyond the purely neuroscientific questioning of the validity of the evidence. The main objective of this article is to point out the necessary critical acceptance of the neuroeducation results in order to avoid a neuroscientific colonialism as a challenge that educational theory must face up to. Firstly we will justify the introduction of neuroeducation in the current educational landscape. Secondly we will conceptualize neuroeducation and neuromyths in order to later on, through an argumentative and critical methodology, analyze the factors behind the acceptance of its discoveries. Thirdly, the Multiple Intelligences theory of H. Gardner will be analyzed in order to exemplify these factors. This analysis will allow us to observe how neuroscientific evidence or lack of them is not always sufficient to consider an educational theory pejoratively as a neuromyth. The discussion lies in the consideration of a lack of scientific evidence from the interdisciplinary dialogue of neuroeducation. Despite of the open debate on its neuroscientific and on its usefulness at the pedagogical level, Multiple Intelligences theory are in tune with the considerations of educational laws in recent years, which have had a significant impact on learning competencies, and on methodologies and evaluations that understand the human being from a holistic point of view, thus opening the door to dialogue with other sciences. © 2021 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

This is a retrospective, longitudinal descriptive study, which reviewed 113 information registries of mothers participating in a traditional educational intervention and 104 mothers with intervention based on multiple intelligences, evaluating the level of knowledge and exclusive maternal breastfeeding practices through observation visits. Results. The intervention based on multiple intelligences achieved greater cost-effectiveness than the traditional intervention given that with lower investment, it managed to get 56.73% of the mothers to increase their knowledge and 68.27% to practice exclusive maternal breastfeeding from six months to more months in comparison with the traditional intervention in which 41.59% and 43.36% improved, respectively. Moreover, for its effective application, on every 100 mothers, its investment would result lower than the traditional program. Conclusion. Upon applying satisfactorily the cost-effectiveness evaluation, as model to compare educational interventions on exclusive maternal breastfeeding, better results were determined with the intervention based on multiple intelligences compared with the traditional intervention, given that with lower investment, it was possible to benefit a greater number of mothers in their level of knowledge and practices of maternal breastfeeding. © 2021, Investigacion y Educacion en Enfermeria.

	abstract = {In the article, the “myth of the given”, a legal positivist postulate of objectivity, is critically analyzed, as well as its negative reflections on the relationship between Law and justice. Furthermore, it is investigated the potential role of legal education in overcoming that conception of Law, uncompromised with its raison d'être. The problem identified is the concealment of prejudices under the guise of neutrality of what legal positivism considers to be beforehand given to it. The question answered is: how can legal teaching contribute to overcoming the legal positivist «myth of the given», which today is viewed as theoretical common sense? The research is qualitative bibliographical. It promotes a philosophical approach to the problem, in a complex post-Gadamerian hermeneutic paradigm - to the detriment of the classic deductivist legal positivist paradigm. The following results are presented: legal teaching, in order to overcome the legal positivist postulate of “neutral data”, needs to focus on activities that exercise prudence, stimulating, with regard to the perception of the acts of the present, all the multiple intelligences of the human being. © 2022 Universidad de Chile.

Based on the theory of multiple intelligences algorithm, this paper constructs a music curriculum integration and development model. This paper establishes a nonnegative matrix decomposition scheme, adds a constraint term that can reflect the smoothness of the time-varying gain matrix to the divergence-based objective function, and iteratively solves the problem of curriculum integration and development through the minimum optimization algorithm obtained by constructing the auxiliary function. In the process of simulation experiment, the optimal solution of each factor matrix was designed, the source music signal was reconstructed, and the sufficiently sparse source music signal was separated. The experimental results show that, compared with the parameter estimation without preprocessing, the parameter estimation with preprocessing is more accurate, the accuracy of the improved algorithm reaches 97.1%, the signal compression ratio reaches 0.656, and the enhanced signal can obtain at most 6 dB. The signal-to-noise ratio is improved, and the convergence speed is fast and asymptotically reaches the lower bound. It is suitable for parameter estimation of low-order and high-order autoregressive processes and effectively promotes the smooth development of music course signals.  © 2022 Dezhi Yu and Tianzhuo Gong.},

	abstract = {Development and dissemination of innovative pedagogies continues to be one of the challenges of the 21st century. The visible deficiencies in the educational field have highlighted the need for other types of pedagogies that promote complete student development. Gardner’s theory about multiple intelligences (MIs) has great potential that has not yet been realised in practice in school contexts. With this research we aimed to analyse the relationship between the intelligences that students develop in primary education and the increase in certain cognitive and academic capacities, and to demonstrate that a pedagogy based on Gardner’s theory does more to promote creativity, maturation and school performance than traditional teaching-learning pedagogies. A total of 420 participants from 2 state-funded schools participated in this study (experimental group = EG; control group = CG). The EG (n = 230) was taught using Gardner’s theory and the CG (n = 190) was taught according to traditional pedagogy. There was an association between the intelligences developed by the students and their academic, creative, and maturational levels. Finally, significant differences were found between the EG and CG, with the EG obtaining a higher mean in the variables analysed in favour of the EG. In conclusion, using MIs in classrooms allows for a more mature and creative development and greater academic performance. © 2021, South African Journal Of Education. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, China has comprehensively carried out and implemented the "national fitness campaign."Sports have been integrated into everyone's daily life. As a place for cultivating talents, colleges and universities have also begun to reform the physical education teaching mode and cultivate a number of talents with strong competition ability, teaching ability, and adaptability to the society. With the deepening of the reform of physical education teaching mode in colleges and universities, some colleges and universities have introduced the theory of multiple intelligences. By analyzing the concept and content of the theory of multiple intelligences and comparing it with the traditional physical education teaching mode, it fully reflects the advantages of the theory of multiple intelligences in physical education teaching. This paper uses fuzzy mathematics and fuzzy set algorithm to build a teaching model based on the theory of multiple intelligences. Moreover, we study the innovative methods of college physical education teaching, take college physical basketball teaching as the research object, and analyze the students' sports technology, students' teaching practice ability, and students' thinking ability based on the theory of multiple intelligences. Experimental outcomes show that the teaching method guided by the theory of multiple intelligences was designed for the intelligent characteristics of the students in the experimental group, and the teachers and students communicated with each other during the teaching period, which significantly improved the students' thinking ability. © 2022 Ming Xie and Xiaoqin Xu.},

	abstract = {The study examined the relationship between student satisfaction with online learning and the intelligence types pos-tulated by Howard Gardner in the multiple intelligences theory. Student satisfaction, being a multifaceted construct, is contingent on an array of factors in an educational setting. Additionally, the introduction of an online (distance) learning model with its recent enhancement has had a bearing on it. The outcomes of the present study indicate a relationship between student learning satisfaction with an online environment and certain types of intelligence, namely interpersonal, naturalistic and visual-spatial. This may stem from students’ characteristics, learning styles as well as the needs each type represents. Moreover, it was revealed that student online learning satisfaction decreases with the length of studies and the results which students achieve. It was also discovered that there was an equal distribution of all intelligence types amongst both men and women whose online learning satisfaction was examined. The online model of learning can sat-isfy students’ academic expectations in the time when they cannot be satisfied otherwise. The outcomes also imply that with the recent development of education, a hybrid and flex-ible model might be welcome in the years to come. © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

	abstract = {An RFID sensor is installed above the classroom door, and the scanning distance is set to 8 m to identify the composite campus cards of incoming and outgoing teachers and students, so as to realize automatic statistics of teachers' theoretical teaching workload and automatic attendance of students' theoretical class hours. The system automatically starts the multimedia equipment just 5 minutes before class and conducts self-checks on all devices in advance, reducing teachers' preclass operation steps. The multimedia management system of all classrooms is connected to the campus network and is centrally controlled by the cloud system. When the multimedia equipment in a classroom fails, it can directly instruct teachers to change to an idle classroom. Using the relevant theories of educational psychology and teaching theory, the WPBL teaching model based on the theory of multiple intelligences is expounded and demonstrated. It focuses on expounding theories and ideas; relationships and structures; and environment and resources and conducts in-depth discussions on relevant design rationales and architectural levels. Research has found that students are more interested in reading English than before. The reason is that in the English reading class of the experimental class, basically every student can have their own teaching activities, and more students like to participate in these activities. Applying the theory of multiple intelligences to English reading teaching has played a positive role in stimulating students' interest in reading. Multiple intelligence English reading activities play an important role in improving students' English reading performance. Through various teaching activities, the students in the experimental class are more interested and confident in the English reading class. Applying the theory of multiple intelligences to the English reading class can improve the students' English reading performance and reading ability. In order to apply the theory of multiple intelligences to actual English reading teaching, when designing personalized English reading activities, teachers should learn to combine the theory with the purpose and content of English reading teaching.  © 2022 Ying Zhou.},

	abstract = {College English has almost always been a required course, and a college student's level of English proficiency is one of the factors used to assess their learning capacity. The quality of students' English learning is largely influenced by the level of English instruction provided in colleges. However, there are still a lot of issues with college English instruction today, the most glaring of which is that English instruction is being overly simplified, and that the methods, modes, and purposes of instruction are also very narrow. Due to this, it is challenging for most colleges and universities' English teaching levels to satisfy the requirements of high-level education. The PSO-BP neural network model, which optimizes the BP neural network (BPNN), is used in this study to build a high-precision and diversified English teaching evaluation model in order to address the aforementioned issues. According to the experimental findings, the PSO-BPNN algorithm has a relative error of just 0.29 percent and an average accuracy rate of 97.02 percent. Overall performance is superior to that of the conventional BPNN algorithm, and it is the most adaptable in terms of creating various evaluation modes.  © 2022 Hailong Li.},

	abstract = {The aim of the article is to determine in the studied groups the multiple intelligence distribution defined in the 1980s by Howard Gardner. The research was conducted in three groups of respondents. The first study group was first-year students of computer science, the second was master (2nd degree) students, educationally 4 years older than the first group. Their intelligence distributions were compared with the intelligence distributions of the third group - graduates of the same university, the same field of study after several years of work in positions consistent with their education. Participants filled one of the multiple intelligence tests selected by answering 24 questions. A group of approximately 110 students and approximately 40 IT employees were examined. As there were statistically justified differences in several significant sub intelligences, a discussion was held on the forms of educational impact on student development paths. The research was carried out in conditions of full voluntary participation in the test and on the basis of self-assessment according to questions suggested in one of the online sources. According to the authors, the results seem interesting, although surprising. © 2020 Vilnius University, ETH Zürich.},

	abstract = {Objective To analyze the structure and characteristics of multiple intelligences in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Methods cross-sectional study was conducted in this study. Totally 63 ASD boys with average age of (6. 18±1. 16) years old were enrolled as ASD group from August 2018 to February 2019, meanwhile 69 typical boys with average age of (5. 98±1. 10) years old were selected as control group. The Chinese Version of Multiple Intelligences Development Scale-A (CMIDAS-A) was used to assess the multiple intelligences of the children. Results he scores of kinesthetic intelligence, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence of ASD boys were significantly lower than those of typical boys (Z=5. 053, 3.177, 6. 398, P<0. 05), while there was no significant differences on the scores of language intelligence, mathematics-logic intelligence, spatial intelligence, musical intelligence and natural intelligence between the two groups(P>0. 05). Conclusions Compared with TD boys, ASD boys are weak in kinesthetic intelligence, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence, and their dominant intelligences were mathematics-logic and music intelligences. So it is supposed to make individualized intervention measures according to the interest and advantages of ASD children. © 2020 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Child Health Care.

Thus, the main purpose of this research was to identify the contribution of Gardner’s theory, considering the use of geotechnologies, to the construction of geographic / cartographic knowledge in Elementary School. First, a review of the literature was written focusing on the concepts of MI and school cartography. Then, a questionnaire was applied to the students in order to evaluate their academic prior knowledge. Next, an educational workshop was held, where thematic notions were presented to the students for their interpretation of cartographic documents and mapping. After that, the students made two maps (one analogue, one digital), which contributed to mobilize the students’ range of intelligences. Finally, a second questionnaire was applied to the students in order to check what, in terms of knowledge, they had acquired. In conclusion, one can highlight that the theory of MI allows the development of student-centred activities, thus contributing to greater success in the teaching-learning process. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Goias.

While itself a single case study, this article suggest that multiple intelligence agencies placed a high premium on acquiring a basic understanding of the internal politics of newly-independent African countries, which were otherwise rendered deliberately opaque by the states themselves as a common sovereignty-preserving device. Using intelligence records from Britain, Czechoslovakia and Portugal, a picture emerges of cross-rival institutional dependency on informants from the peripheries who were empowered by their years at metropolitan centers, offering a challenging perspective to institutional-focused studies of Cold War intelligence. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

A questionnaire was administrated to the 95 undergraduate EFL junior students to identify their dominant type of intelligence at a private university in Iraq. Based on their dominant type of intelligence, different learning centers were established with different activities for each one. After a 16-week experiment period the effects of Multiple Intelligence teaching activities were measured by using pretest, progress tests, achievement exams and a posttest. The results of this study indicated that the experimental group has significantly developed their reading comprehension skills in terms of understanding and visualizing the meaning in the mind.

A total of 237 expatriates were assessed. In our nine-factor model, we found that work adjustment had the most mediating effects on the relationships between the three intelligences and expatriate outcomes, while interaction adjustment had no mediating effect. General adjustment mediated the relationship between emotional intelligence (EQ) and premature return, and between EQ and work adjustment. Of the three intelligences, EQ had indirect effects on all three expatriate outcomes, while cultural and political intelligences each had indirect effects on task performance and psychological well-being. Our study is one of the first to examine the impact of three interpersonal, malleable intelligences and the separate mediating effects of CCA dimensions on multiple expatriate outcomes using a single model.

	abstract = {Promoting the sustainable development is currently a key global issue posing a challenge to all of us on personal, professional and political levels. The education plays a major role in this path, in particular the education for sustainable development (ESD). The traditional one-way transfer of knowledge is no longer sufficient to inspire the students to behave as responsible citizens. This article suggests a number of competencies, which must serve as a basis for ESD, as well as application of the multiple intelligence theory as a mechanism for implementing the competencies derived by students from ESD at the basic education level. It is proved that security competencies in the broadest sense (covering all levels, from personal to the global space) should also be included in the modern educational process. As for the university education, it is required to explain the concept of "sustainability" to all specialties without exception, including the political scientists, engineers and others. This is particularly important for training of experts dealing with the economic law issues. A lack of economic analysis in modern legal studies and development of regulations results in writing and adoption of idle laws hazardous for the country. To upgrade the education system in Ukraine, it is appropriate to develop the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development and its implementation plan based on the global Sustainable Development Goals. It is required to switch from traditional education to the model focused on sustainable development with the underlying extensive interdisciplinary knowledge based on an integrated approach to the development of society, economy, and environment. Implementation of this strategy should consider the adaptive nature of the regional education component, in particular the economic features of a relevant region. It is important to focus on the learning processes underlying the circular economy. © 2020 The Author. Journal Compilation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe a support system to the selection of enrichment activities in educational environment called RunayaySoft, where Runayay comes from the word Quechua that means develop and Soft as it is an informatics tool that supports the educational institutions and their students, in the selection of activities that allow foster some of their skills based on their interests, learning styles, aptitudes, multiple intelligences, preferences and so on. Moreover, it suggests institutions about the activities that they should make in their building considering student´s characteristics and the agreements that they have. Design/methodology/approach: It does a diagnostic for identifying which characteristics are going to be considered to students and institutions. Then, it generates adaptive profiles with the aim of generating suggestions of enrichment activities that allow to boost some of their skills. For the students were considered their preferences, learning style, aptitude, multiple intelligences and interests. In the case of institutions were the agreements, resources and activities that they develop. Based on this information, it defines the relations for the generation of suggestions of activities toward students, where it does the prioritization of which activities should be considered. Findings: For validating the system, it was done as a functional prototype that generates suggestions to students, as well as educative institutions, through a satisfaction test student assess if they agree or disagree with the suggestions given. With that assessment, it is validated the relationship between student’s characteristics, activity and institution are related for generating activities suggestions. Research limitations/implications: RunayaySoft generates adaptive profiles for the students, activity and institution. Each profile has information that allows adapt an advice toward students and institutions. Social implications: RunayaySoft considers student’s characteristics, activities and educational institutions for generating suggestions for enrichment activities that allow to boost some of their skills. Many times, when activities are generated in educative institutions, they are not considered a learner’s needs and characteristics. For that reason, the system helps institutions to identify activities that should be done in their facilities or with those institutions which they have agreements when the institutions that students come from do not have the required resources. Originality/value: RunayaySoft suggests enrichment activities to students as well as educative institutions. For students, it suggests disciplinary areas where they can boost their skills; for each disciplinary area are recommended activities based on their preferences. Once students select the disciplinary area and activities, the system suggests educative institutions activities that they can do. If the institutions do not have the necessary facilities, the system shows with which other institutions they can set agreements. Moreover, it supports educative institutions to identify enrichment clusters, where it clusters students based on similar interest, allowing institutions to identify the activities that they should focus on. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This development trend must also be accompanied by an increase in the quality of students soft skills. Therefore, schools should be given extensive autonomy in the management of character education to strengthen the ethos transformation of students according to the demands of the Industry 4.0. Schools must improve themselves from the educational process which has been more focused on strengthening knowledge (intellectual intelligence) and ignoring the soft skill aspects (strengthening spiritual intelligence and emotional intelligence). This research has produced a Multiple intelligence-based character education management model to strengthen the ethos transformation of students in Gorontalo Province which can be a reference for all levels of education. The method adapted in this study was the Borg and Gall model which included 5 steps: (1) analysing the product to be developed, (2) developing the initial product, (3) expert validation and revision, small-scale field trials and product revisions, and (5) large-scale trials and final products. The developed model produced guidelines of planning, program implementation, monitoring and evaluation of character education management in order to strengthen the ethos transformation of students. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire 'key competencies', aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The applications of multiple intelligence theory in education are wide. Students apply the learning in the classroom according to their own dominant intelligence and learning style, which is most effective for them. Combining learning styles with dominant intelligences enhances the students' learning processes. The purpose of this case study is to examine the relationship between dominant intelligences according to Gardner's multiple intelligence theory and middle school students' academic achievement. A case study was conducted in Israel, in a middle school, among seventh-graders and involved 158 students. Findings indicated that in excellent classes-80.9% of students had logical intelligence, in at least one of the levels of dominance; in ordinary classes only 48.4% of students have logical intelligence, at least in one of the levels of dominance. We also examined the relationship between the amount of dominant intelligences among students in all classes, excellent and ordinary. Findings indicated that in excellent classes the percentage of students with two or three dominant intelligences was higher than the percentage in ordinary classes. It is important to note that these are not just the logical and verbal, but also all types of intelligences, such as spatial, musical, kinetic and others. In conclusion, the dominant intelligences that highly influence and measure achievement in the education system are not the logical-mathematical and the linguistic-verbal, but the only logical-mathematical. Moreover, the amount of intelligences at the dominant levels can predict and indicate student's success at school. © 2020, Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.},

Data collected from 67 ESL teachers in a midwestern U.S. state by completing the Intelligence Index and the MI-Framed Teaching Strategies Index were analyzed using Pearson correlations. Results indicate that ESL teachers used linguistic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal teaching strategies more frequently. The strength of the relationships between ESL teachers' self-perceived MI domains and their uses of the relevant MI-framed teaching strategies were weak or not significant. Whether such linkage actually exists may also depend on the experiential, motivational, and contextual factors of the instructional settings.

Therefore, this research identifies the behaviour patterns and non-routine mathematical problem-solving strategies based on multiple intelligences among primary school pupils. A total of 13 Year Five primary schoolers from primary schools in Johor Bahru were involved in the study. The research instruments were categorised into the pupils’ multiple intelligences and the behaviour patterns with their non-routine mathematical problem-solving strategies. The Multiple Intelligence Inventory semi-structured interview protocol for the type of intelligence and a checklist were used to classify the dominant intelligence of the pupils. Meanwhile, the instruments used to determine the behaviour patterns and the non-routine mathematical problem-solving strategies were non-routine mathematical problem-solving question sets, semi-structured interview protocols and a checklist. The analysis shows that the respondents consisted of seven different intelligences which are, verbal-linguistic, logic mathematics, intrapersonal, visual-spatial, interpersonal, kinesthetics, and music. The behaviour patterns were analysed according to Polya’s Problem-Solving Model (1971). Various mathematical problem-solving strategies were applied by the respondents such as logical thinking, organising data, drawing visual representation, and working backwards. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Therefore, three objectives of the study are to identify the multiple intelligences among students, the dominant of multiple intelligence in the workshop’s practical subjects and to identify the significant differences between multiple intelligences and the gender of the 4th year student from School of Education, Faculty of Social Science and Humanities, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in the subject practical workshop. The design of this study is a descriptive study using quantitative data. In this study, the population identified consists of 204 4th year students of the School of Education, Faculty of Social Science and Humanities who attended the Bachelor of Technology with Education in Mechanical Engineering (SPPJ), Buildings (SPPQ), Electrical and Electronic (SPPR) and Living Skills (SPPH). A total of 180 samples were identified based on sampling formula and the instrument used was a set of questionnaire with reliability value of α = 0.86 which contained 48 items in part B based on multiple intelligence and respondent demographic in part A. The study data was processed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS version 25 to get the results of the study in the form of descriptive analysis like percentage, frequency, mean score and standard deviation while inference analysis with independent Ttest to find mean difference between gender. The findings show that each student has more than one intelligence for each respondent and the intelligence of Naturalist, Intrapersonal, Verbal Linguistics and Kinestatic Body is the dominant intelligence of the students. In addition, the findings showed that there was no significant difference between the multiple intelligences and the gender of the students.

	abstract = {Naturalistic intelligence is a part of multiple intelligences, while problem-solving skills are part of higher-order thinking. Both are learning outcomes required to be developed and improved since these competences were considered poor in Indonesia. Field trip is a learning method that can encourage students to interact directly with the real object in nature. That learning method is expected to improve students’ naturalistic intelligence and problem-solving skills. In this case, this research was conducted to discover the influence of field trip on students’ naturalistic intelligence and problem-solving skills. This research was an experimental research using pre-test and post-test design. The eighth-graders of Islamic school (Madrasah Tsanawiyah) Pameungpeuk, Garut, year of 2017/2018 were employed as the respondents. The obtained data were analysed using the average comparison tests, which were t-test (for parametric data) and Wilcoxon test (for nonparametric data) with α value of 0.05. Based on the analysis, there was a significant difference of students’ natural intelligence with the sign value of 00,05. These results were supported by the percentage of the affective aspect questionnaire in naturalistic intelligence. In problem-solving skills analysis, the test score revealed a significant difference with sign value of 0.025 even though the results of the questionnaire only showed a slight difference. Therefore, it was concluded that field trip influenced students’ naturalistic intelligence, however, it had no influence on the affective aspect of problem-solving skills, and conversely it influenced the cognitive aspect of problem-solving skills. Field trip is potential to be an alternative method for teacher in junior high school to improve naturalistic intelligence and problem-solving skills applied in ecosystem subject. © 2019 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

	abstract = {Differentiated instruction has been a buzz word in Philippine education for many years. Educators utilize differentiated approach in teaching to maximize and meet the expected learning outcomes. Previous study pointed out that students vary in terms of learning style and understanding the concept. This study aims to identify the role of differentiated instruction in teaching reading and promoting comprehension in basic education. This paper looked at four differentiated instructional strategies for teaching guided reading: Noting details, sequencing events, getting the main idea and predicting outcomes. Moreover, it seeks to determine the multiple intelligence profile and the performance in reading comprehension of the students. It also determines whether a significant correlation exists between the profile and the performance of the students. Data were generated using adapted multiple intelligences inventory instruments and written passages, prescribed curriculum by the Department of Education. The data obtained were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and chi-square. The findings revealed that students learned from all aspects of intelligence they have, no matter what the situation is. This was so intriguing because it was known that every individual has different learning intelligence. Pedagogically, the findings recommended that educators need to innovate to help meet the needs of diverse learners, enriched reading activities, and differentiated instructions must be integrated to strengthen learner competence in basic reading comprehension. The surprising finding is that, though students learn differently, there are also some learning contexts, which students shared with the same entity. Therefore, teachers must recognize that students have different versions of learning. Copyright©2020 by authors},

	abstract = {Because of the important role of multiple intelligences (MIs) in learning a second/foreign langue (L2) as supported by the existing second language acquisition (SLA) literature, some pragmatic scholars have asked for studying their contribution to pragmatic competence (e.g., Taguchi & Roever, 2017). Accordingly, the present investigation has attempted to examine the relationship between L2 learners’ multiple intelligences and their speech-act pragmatic performance. A sample of 124 EFL students who were selected from an initial sample of 206 learners at two Iranian state universities based on their scores on the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) took part in this study. The data collection procedure was done in two subsequent phases. First, McKenzie's (1999) multiple intelligences (MI) survey including 90 items was filled out by the participants. Then, a validated 50-item multiple-choice discourse completion test (MDCT) including five frequent English speech acts (requests, apologies, refusals, complaints, and compliments/compliment responses) was administered. Data analysis using multiple regression revealed that four of the intelligence including logical, interpersonal, verbal, and intrapersonal intelligences were significant predictors of L2 learners' speech-act pragmatic knowledge. Among these four intelligences, verbal intelligence was the strongest followed by interpersonal, intrapersonal, and logical intelligences. However, five other intelligences (i.e., naturalistic, musical, existential, visual, & kinesthetic intelligences were not significant predictors of L2 pragmatic performance). These findings can have some pedagogical implications for EFL teachers in helping their learners develop their speech-act pragmatic knowledge based on their MIs. © 2020, Teaching English Language and Literature Society of Iran (TELLSI).

	abstract = {The potential of multiple intelligences of early childhood possessed from birth will be able to develop optimally when they get the right parenting patterns from their parents. Unfortunately, there are still many parents, especially in Java who do not understand it, so parenting tends to be careless. On the other hand, related research is still very limited. This research aimed to explore parenting patterns by parents in developing multiple intelligences in early childhood. This research used qualitative methods with a phenomelogical approach to uncover this phenomenon. Data collection was carried out by in-depth and open interviews with three parents who have early childhood with excellence and achievements in the field of multiple intelligences. Data analysis used a phenomenological qualitative analysis. This research indicates that there are three main themes of parenting patterns, namely: 1) identification of children's interests and talents: Done by parents intensively by observing activities that are preferred and become children's excellence intensively; 2) the demandingness and responsiveness of parents in developing children's multiple intelligences: Parents' high demandingness and responsiveness can develop early childhood multiple intelligences; and 3) the development and stimulation of multiple intelligences: Parents stimulate the children's multiple intelligences talents by having children take a course and various competition activities that are appropriate to their abilities. In short, our research shows that balanced demands and responses from parents are required so that the multiple intelligences can develop optimally so that they will be able to make the expected abilities and achievements. © 2020 by authors.},

In fact, the search for modern creative means for teaching Arabic language prompts foreign students to readily accept them to enable us in the modern age world that is characterized by the availability and accessibility of information to rely on media technologies, digital technology, and multimedia. This study focuses on the significance of multiple intelligences theory in teaching Arabic language for several reasons to facilitate the process of language acquisition for students. Such theory points out that each student has unique multiple intelligences and different ways to learn. It entails that language learning and acquisition is associated with the learning methods that vary from one person to another. The current study seeks to observe the methods of teaching Arabic language for non-native speakers as well as the different types of teaching methods that differ among teachers, along with students’ responses and motivations. The study raises the following questions: how the teaching methods employed for encouraging students enable them to be creative? How can the teacher enhance students' motivation to learn Arabic language? and how can the teacher employ multiple intelligences for teaching Arabic language for non-Arabic speakers? For this objective, descriptive and analytical research are used for describing the phenomenon and highlighting its reasons that led to its emergence, followed by analyzing and its effects and consequences. Finally, the study provides suggestions to accept and adapt language learning. Most important, such approach attempts to cover the general and private motives for learning Arabic among foreigners. It assumes that such motives might be integrative, religious motive, complementary, beneficial or functional motives. © 2019 Global Research Online. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Subjective initiative exerts critical impact on individual behavior and in turn individual internal factors play a dynamic role on subjects according to Bandura's Triadic Reciprocal Determinism which is one of the representatives of Bandura's social cognitive theory. Self-efficacy focuses on subjective factors and it is mainly about belief that subject has in his or her ability to obtain achievement and cope with challenges posed by target tasks. The more capable individuals judge themselves to be the higher the possibility for them to spare no effort to take action especially. Reading self-efficacy is one of the best forms of subjective initiative and is affected by various factors. Individuals possess unique intelligent styles exerting influence on reading self-efficacy. In order to provide a more effectively targeted intervention and guidance on library users' reading behavior the paper rooted in self-efficacy theory and multiple intelligences theory aims to explore the relationship between library users' reading self-efficacy and multiple intelligences quantitatively. Sample data for Logistic analysis regression is collected through an online survey and combined an offline way. Participants are recruited from China targeting for 615 university students including undergraduate students N=185 master students N=273 and doctoral students N= 157 . Logistic regression method is used to establish regression equations and based on the results of data analysis the relationship model between reading self-efficacy and multiple intelligences is constructed. The findings of the survey are as follows. 1 Library users' reading self-efficacy shows a significant difference in education levels that is the higher the education level the higher the probability of users' reading self-efficacy above the average namely doctoral students get the highest probability of higher reading self-efficacy scores followed by master students and undergraduate students. In terms of gender logical-mathematical intelligence kinesthetic intelligence interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence show significance and furthermore male scores higher on those kinds of intelligences than female. In regard to liberal arts and sciences sciences students share a higher level than liberal arts students when considering logical-mathematical intelligence. 2 The analytic domain of multiple intelligences which consists of logical-mathematical intelligence rhythmic intelligence and naturalist intelligence indicates that science students acquire higher probability of higher scores than liberal arts students and the introspective domain which involves intrapersonal intelligence and visual intelligence demonstrates that male gets higher probability of higher scores than female and sciences students higher than liberal arts students. Respecting the introspective domain which includes linguistic intelligence interpersonal intelligence and kinesthetic intelligence is significant by gender and male's probability of gaining higher scores is higher than female. 3 In view of the relationship between reading self-efficacy and multiple intelligences linguistic intelligence visual intelligence introspective intelligence naturalist intelligence and three kinds of multiple intelligences domains positively affect reading self-efficacy. The findings of the study offer a perspective for library reading promotion and an insight into understanding thoroughly the relationship between library users' reading self-efficacy and multiple intelligences. Taking the results into consideration a dynamic model which focuses on library users' reading self-efficacy and multiple intelligences in the context of reading promotion is developed. From the perspective of system dynamics the model consisting of reading promotion library user library users' reading self-efficacy and library users' multiple intelligences contributes to library users' reading achievements and ultimately conduces reading promotion to pay off. 2 figs. 8 tabs. 44 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Several students' intelligences that can strengthen their problem-solving skill is known as multiple intelligences. The various intelligence leads students to use different strategies in solving a problem. This study employed descriptive research with a quantitative approach to study the students’ strategies in solving a mathematics problem based on their multiple intelligences. In this study, students’ multiple intelligences were investigated through multiple intelligences profiling questionnaire VII (MIPQ VII). Further, an interview was conducted to collect the data of the students’ problem-solving strategies. Twenty-nine students in one of the junior high schools in Banda Aceh participated in the study. The results revealed that there was a variety of intelligence among the students in Aceh. Students with intrapersonal intelligence tended to use the strategies of logical reasoning and viewing a problem from a different perspective. They were also able to create a new and unique strategy in solving the problem, but some errors calculation were found causing the wrong solution. Besides, the students with logical intelligence were inclined to solve the problem using logical consideration and trial-and-error strategies. They have not been able to create a new and unique strategy but can provide the right solution for a problem. However, the students with linguistic, spatial, and interpersonal intelligence used merely logical consideration strategy to solve the problem. © 2020 IJSTR.},

The correlational survey model was used in the research. The subjects were 230 volunteer university students, chosen by simple random sampling method. The Multiple Intelligence Areas Inventory and The Effective Communication Skills Scale were used. The result showed that there was a significant difference in favor of female students in terms of effective listening by gender. A significant difference was found in favor of the Recreation Department in terms of self-recognition/self-disclosure, I-language, and verbal intelligence sub-dimensions. A significant difference was found in favor of 21-23 age in self-recognition/self-disclosure sub-dimension by age variable. According to academic GPA, a significant difference was found in the verbal intelligence sub-dimension in favor of those whose academic GPA was 3.15-3.57. In addition, according to way of taking the ECS course, a significant difference was found in favor of the compulsory course in the sub-dimensions of ego supportive language, self-recognition/self-disclosure, and I-language. Besides, it was determined that there is a positive and significant relationship between students' effective communication skills and verbal intelligence levels. As a result, it has been determined that, in terms of the development of communication skills, it is important that the ECS course is included in the curriculum as part of the compulsory course. © 2020 The Author(s).},

The study took place in two local authorities in Scotland. The intervention is informed by the ‘Teaching for Understanding Framework’ (Project Zero, Harvard University) and ‘Multiple Intelligence Theory.’ The study examines the impact of the intervention on participating pupils, in the process exploring the variables that impacted on pupil progress both internal and external to the intervention. The findings highlight the importance of: building trustful and respectful relationships between adults and children; creating a safe environment in which children will be listened to and cared for; high quality pedagogy and continuity and progression across the transition; and understanding the complexity of factors which may impact on the transition for individual children, particularly for those who may be at greater risk across it. © 2019, © 2019 SEBDA.},

More attention should be paid to students’ emotions in higher education to enhance students’ engagement in the classroom and improve social awareness (i.e., respecting others, understanding other perspectives, providing help to those who need it), motivation, and academic achievement. This article focuses on the implementation of practices that promote SEL in higher education and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. The paper aims to assess the academic and behavioral-related outcomes of applying SEL in mineralogy, an Earth science introductory course in a four-year university. The results of the present paper reveal that instructional practices supporting SEL are suited for engaging and stimulating learners’ multiple intelligences. The observed student course assessment performance suggests that integrating SEL may be a viable strategy for promoting student interest in science, building stress resilience, and creating more positive engagement with students. The instructional practices reported in this paper could support science instructors in designing teaching methods that promote self-management and social awareness to increase students’ academic outcomes. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Multiple intelligence (MI) theory by Howard Gardner provides a cognitive view point on intelligence which has sound educational implications. in general and in particular. This theory has led to the use of eight major multiple intelligence-based activities in second Language teaching and learning. Usually in an educational setting, teachers use logical and verbal intelligence in the case of second language teaching. Whereas the MI theory can transform the way teachers and students believe regarding learning a language. Gardner’s theory of intelligence demonstrates that students learn differently therefore, it is required to have a multiplicity of approaches and activities in the classroom. The basic fact behind multiple intelligence activities is that the student can learn a second language by various types of intelligence. MI based activities are useful for second language teaching in multiple contexts and situations. The most important aspect of using MI based activities in an English classroom is that it helps students from rural background to learn English as a second language. Rural students face different types of challenges in learning English when they go for college education. This study has attempted to explore the role of multiple intelligence based activities among rural students who have completed schooling in a different medium of instruction other than English and joined the college. The study has further emphasized on designing MI based activities for teaching English communication skills in a classroom setting. The study has used qualitative approach and consolidates the best teaching practices and its implications under seven multiple intelligences for Language learning. The study has deployed seven multiple intelligence based activities which was initially identified by Gardner in 1993. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Since the students' intellegence is diverse and complex, the teacher should determine the learning method that is in accordance with the students' intelligence. The purpose of this research is to classify the intelligence tendencies possessed by students based on Gardner's theory, namely: linguistic, logical mathematic, spatial, kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. The subjects of the study were 42 students in 1st grade at Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Al-Inayah located at Pasar Rebo. Data is processed using data mining algorithms with clustering techniques and data processing using Weka software. The results of the analysis obtained by two clusters as many as 20 students (48%) had a tendency of 8 multiple intelligences slightly higher than the other 22 students (52%). The highest intelligence of 13.14% is shown in interpersonal intelligence in the second cluster and 13.05% in the first cluster, which means that students have communication skills that are built directly against the interlocutor (face to face). Another high intelligence is math logic intelligence, this supports the learning process of mathematics in the classroom. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.},

	abstract = {Relevance: Improving the medico-psycho-physiological support of professional activity of employees of hazardous industries is associated, in particular, with the development of techniques for rapid assessment of psychophysiological adaptation to significantly reduce examination time. For this, a questionnaire of multiple intelligence by G. Gardner (modified by V.A. Minkin and Ya.N. Nikolaenko) can be used within the VibraMI program. The Vibra program makes it possible to reduce the testing time to only 7-10 minutes vs 1.5-2.0 hours as in conventional examination. Up to date, there are no quantitative criteria for rapid assessment of psychophysiological adaptation by multiple intelligence parameters. Intention: To develop criteria for rapid assessment of psychophysiological adaptation of hazardous industry workers based on the characteristics of multiple intelligence. Methodology: The object of the study was the psychophysiological adaptation of workers at "Elektrokhimpribor" plant at the stage of periodic medical examination. An integrated psychophysiological study was carried out with the use of specified techniques and methods for assessing multiple intelligence to estimate conscious and unconscious reactions of the participants when answering questions. assess the relationship between the presence/absence of psychophysiological maladjustment and characteristics of multiple intelligence. Results and analysis: According to the results of complex experimental studies, the leading qualities of the workers of the main production of the plant were identified: natural, motor and interpersonal intelligence. The greatest differences between workers with the absence and presence of psychophysiological maladjustment are observed in motor intelligence. It is demonstrated that unconscious manifestations are associated with sincerity of responses and their compliance with internal guidelines. An integral indicator of psychophysiological adaptation disorders is based on conscious and unconscious reactions, and a nomogram of probability of these disorders was developed. Proposed criteria for the rapid assessment reduce duration of psychophysiological examination to 7-10 minutes. Conclusion: The developed criteria of rapid assessment can be used to select professionals for important assignments, to conduct periodic psychophysiological examinations, to evaluate psychophysiological "price" of activities in case of emergencies and elimination of their consequences. This will preserve the professional health of workers in hazardous industries and minimize human-related risk factors. © 2019 Nikiforov Russian Center of Emergency and Radiation Medicine, EMERCOM of Russia.

As the basis for building classes in modern conditions, the author considers the taxonomy of the pedagogical goals of B. Bloom and G. Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences (MI). Findings: The taxonomy of pedagogical goals can be one of the key foundations in the design of modern occupations of various types; the theory of MI – in the construction of classes of different subject areas. As examples for the argumentation, the author used the educational technologies of “problem education” and “project education.” Practical implications: This study is a modest contribution to didactics (the science of theories and learning technologies). The results of the research actualize the work of B. Bloom and G. Gardner in the context of modern requirements for the results and content of education in general and vocational schools. The main provisions of the paper should supplement a number of such works where the solution of modern problems in education is built on the traditions and innovations balance. Originality/value: The algorithm of applying the “foundations” in the modern studies’ planning can be used for lessons of various types and different subject areas.

	abstract = {Purpose: Globally, the business organisations are experiencing a transformation due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The need for an effective 4IR leadership has placed new demands on organisations to develop and select leaders to effectively lead the organisations in the 4IR era. Hence, it becomes important to understand the attributes for an effective 4IR leadership. This study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised. The hypothesised relationships from the framework were tested using a survey of 416 senior construction executives across the nine provinces of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the study objectives, an online survey was sent to construction firms across the nine provinces of South Africa. “Construction”, for the purpose of this study comprised building and civil engineering firms listed on the construction industry development board (cidb) register of contractors in South Africa. The target group was the upper echelon executives, i.e. Chairman, CEOs, managing directors and chief operating officers, and the survey was directed to contact e-mail of the study samples. The professional service providers (architects, consultants and surveyors) were not part of the survey sample. The database of the organisational leaders was obtained from the cidb. The online survey was created on the 23rd of August 2019 and closed on the 23rd of April 2020, thereby making the duration of the survey eight months. The total number of respondents at the time of closure of the survey was four hundred and sixteen (416). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the analysis of the results. Findings: This study validates the effective 4IR leadership framework as proposed by Alade and Windapo (2019) by empirically examining relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership. The findings from this study have shown that effective 4IR leadership is positively associated with leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Hence, an effective 4IR leader must spread the knowledge and understanding of the 4IR opportunities and threats in the organisations. The leader must ensure that the executives in the construction organisation become change conversant and ensure that the employees acquire 4IR skills. Multiple leadership intelligence is essential to effective 4IR leadership. These multiple intelligence are the ability to adapt knowledge and skills to different situations, ability to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously, a high level of understanding, ability to process and analyse information and ability to utilise knowledge from many disciplinary boundaries. Research limitations/implications: This study is focused on construction business organisations in South Africa. As such, similar studies on 4IR leadership effectiveness can be carried out in other countries and across other organisations. Future studies should also consider using a case study approach specifically focused on organisations with high implementations of 4IR technologies. Interacting with the leaders of such organisations and their employees will give a broader perspective in understanding the reasons of their effectiveness. Practical implications: The leadership of construction organisations must partner with the academia, industry players and team members in their efforts to implement 4IR in their organisations. Also, the existence of a positive association between leadership traits and effective 4IR leadership implies that to ensure a 4IR-driven work process in construction organisations, the leadership must embrace disruption and quickly respond to change. Further, it can be concluded from the findings of this study that appropriate leadership styles are required for effective 4IR leadership. The appropriate leadership style for effective 4IR leadership requires the leadership of construction organisations to delegate some of the 4IR function. The 4IR function must be performed based on the challenges that are associated with 4IR. The positive correlation between leadership intelligence and leadership styles makes it possible to conclude that the competencies of leadership of construction organisations in a 4IR-driven change depend on the level of leadership intelligence of the executives of construction organisations. It is evident that 4IR will change the business environment; hence, leadership intelligence is required to adapt construction organisations to the change dynamics. This study has provided information on what 4IR leadership entails in construction organisations. The study has contributed a framework for ensuring effective and smooth flow 4IR implementation in construction organisations through a purposeful leadership that combines leadership styles, leadership traits and leadership intelligence. Social implications: This research will be useful to government agencies and board members of construction organisations, in appointing leaders to see the construction industry and organisations perform better in the 4IR era. Young individuals who are also aspiring to take on leadership role in the industry will benefit from this study. Originality/value: This study is a new and original research that seeks to investigate the need for an effective 4IR leadership in construction business organisations. Construction as an industry is usually criticised for her slow response to change. Since leadership is required to drive the change agenda, this study examines the relationships between leadership styles, leadership traits, leadership intelligence and effective 4IR leadership to empirically validate the effective 4IR leadership framework that was conceptualised. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Strategies of meaning formation are included in the highest level of regulation of an individual life. The article presents the results of empirical determination of the polar meaning strategies marker. In the initial modeling of the meaning formation processes, two polar strategies are proposed: adaptive and developmental. The system of personal meanings occupies a central place in the structure of the personality and is correlated with its properties manifested in interactions. For an empirical description of polar strategies, we developed nine scales of personality properties according to the type of private semantic differential. In these bipolar semantic scales, we used words that denote personality traits that act as indicators of meaning. An empirical study was carried out with the use of various techniques for studying semantic regulation of a person to determine a marker that allows one to identify these meaning strategies. The battery of tests included: the author’s private semantic differential, including nine scales of personality properties, “Test of life-sense orientations” (by D. A. Leontiev), test “Who Am I?” (by M. Kuhn), “Multiple intelligence test” (by G. Gardner), “Test of frustration tolerance” (by S. Rosenzweig), “Questionnaire of personality reflection” (by I. A. Stetsenko). An empirical sample (n = 145) found that a stable positive statistically significant correlation (p≤.05) exists only between the indicators of nine developed scales of personal properties and the indicator “Meaningfulness of life” in the “Test of life-sense orientations” by D.A. Leontiev. This indicator “Meaning-fulness of life” can be used as an indicator marker of polar strategies of meaning formation: adaptive and developmental. Its use contributes to a more effective study of the processes of meaning formation and reduces the laboriousness of diagnostic procedures. © 2020, Association for the Development of Science, Engineering and Education.

A bibliographical review was done on the theory of multiple intelligences by Howard Gardner and about the methodological pluralism with the goal of developing a democratic learning unit that would stimulate many types of intelligence and that would involve the biggest number of students possible. The data was collected through the audio taping of classes, the observation of participants and a questionnaire done at the end of the unit. To do the analysis of the data, the Discursive Textual Analysis proposed by Moraes and Galiazzi (2007) was chosen. The intelligence spectrum was defined as a priori categories. It was observed that some methodologies stimulate a range of intelligences that was not initially expected. Besides that, practical activities in groups demonstrated to be the best way to stimulate multiple intelligences. At last, the manifestation of eight intelligences during the research were verified, a fact that was only possible due to the diverse methodologies used. © 2019 Lutheran University of Brazil.

The theoretical context of our research is language socialization theory which emphasizes how learners actively construct new identities for themselves, consciously or unconsciously, as they acquire and use language. This language socialization is embedded in particular socio-political and historical contexts, bringing fluidity to the meanings of bilingualism and to identity. Our discussion is about our methodological journey, how we drew upon the broader principles of constructivist learning, and specifically Universal Design for learning and Multiple Intelligences, within focus group research to access these perspectives and identities. Our methodology involved multiple opportunities to present, express and engage in the construction of knowledge, and to engage students in identifying and expressing meaning related to their identities and perspectives as learners of French. Our research demonstrated that, by drawing on pedagogical theory, focus groups can be transformative for participants, and they provide ways to circumvent challenges in conducting qualitative research with adolescents. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Objective: This paper constructed the children's multiple sports activity module from the perspective of Multiple Intelligences, and explored the effect of sports activity module on physical fitness of young children. Methods: A total of 176 children aged 3-6 years were randomly divided into control and experimental classes for 24 weeks, 5 times/week, 30 minutes/time. Children in the experimental class received multi-sports activity module, and children in the control class received general sports activities. Activity duration, intensity and frequency of the experimental class and the control class were basically the same. Results: This study constructed the children' s multiple sports activity module with eight pieces of content from the perspective of Multiple Intelligences. Before the intervention, there was no statistical difference between the experimental class and the control class (P> 0.05), and the height of the children aged 3 to 4 years after the intervention in the experimental class [(109.29 ± 6.56) cm] was significantly higher than that before the intervention [(105.11 ± 5.51) cm] (P<0.01). After intervention, the walking balance beam, the 10-meter reverse run and the feet continuous jump of the children aged 3 to 4 years in the experimental class were significantly higher than those in the control class (P<0.01). The standing long jump, sitting position forward flexion of the children aged 3 to 4 years were also significantly higher than those in the control class (P<0.05). The balance beam of the children aged 4 to 5 years in the experimental class was significantly higher than that in the control class (P<0.01). Tennis throw, sitting position forward flexion, 10-meter reverse run, feet continuous jump of the children aged 4 to 5 years were also significantly higher than the control class (P< 0.05) . The walking balance beam of the children aged 5 to 6 years was significantly higher in the experimental class than that in the control class (P<0.01), the standing long jump tennis throw, the sitting position forward flexion, The 10-meter reverse run and the continuous jump of the feet of the children aged 5 to 6 years were also significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05).

The theoretical framework developed related IL competencies to competencies for success as described by the psychologist Howard Gardner in his book “Five Minds for the Future”. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical framework was developed using the CILIP Seven Pillars for IL and Howard Gardner’s Five Minds theory. Indicative connections between the Seven Pillars and Five Minds were identified by the researchers. The framework was tested through analysis of transcripts from qualitative interviews conducted with four small business owners. Findings: Connections were found between the Seven Pillars and the Five Minds; some which had been projected by the researchers and others which had not. The theoretical framework aided description of and understanding of IL within small business workplace environments. Research limitations/implications: A small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings, and further testing of the framework is required. The findings do, however, suggest that the context in which IL manifests remains significant and should be further examined in wider and divergent contexts. Originality/value: Using theory from psychology paired with a well-known theory of IL to develop a new theoretical framework is novel. The framework developed offers a new way of understanding the role of IL within the context of small business workplaces. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As a matter of course, differentiated instruction has begun to receive scholarly and professional attention in the hopes of ameliorating learner outcomes through learner-aware teaching. Despite a great deal of recorded research, little is known about how differentiated instruction is prepared and operationalized. This study, conducted at a private high school in Istanbul, Turkey, investigated the impact of differentiated instruction on Turkish L2 learners’ L2 achievement along with the perceptions of learners and teacher. Two intact classes were selected as control (N=14) and DI group (N=8). The control group was exposed to traditional instruction, while the DI group received differentiated instruction guided by the principles of constructivism, multiple intelligence theory (Gardner, 1993), and the differentiated instruction framework of Tomlinson (1999). Data collected by means of L2 achievement tests revealed that DI group outperformed the control group in overall L2 achievement. Learner reflective essays revealed that Turkish L2 learners found differentiated instruction as distinctive, entertaining, engaging, instructive, and interest-related, while teacher reflective journals raised the issues of time constraints, needs for learner awareness and training about differentiated instruction. © 2020 EJAL & the Authors.},

Several studies have identified MI in school children; nevertheless, in Mexico, these studies have been scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the differences of MI between genders and the grades-in-school of Mexican elementary schoolchildren. In an effort to investigate the differences of MI in elementary school children in Mexico, we provided a self-administered questionnaire to 161 Mexican students. Overall, our findings showed that the students’ mean averages in the eight categories of MI were similar in both genders; in fact, the only significant differences in gender were found in intrapersonal intelligence (males reporting higher intrapersonal differences than females). No other significant differences in MI were found, nor were there interaction effects between gender and the grade in school. In summary, these results give us an understanding that the different types of MI may not be that well implemented in elementary school children. © 2020 The Author(s); Education, Psychology, Multiple intelligence, Educational innovation, Elementary students, Intelligences, Students. © 2020 The Author(s)},

To achieve this the researchers surveyed other experiences in this context and analyzed a unit in terms of the availability of MIs-based activities in Unlimited Series/Level Four/Unit Two/Cambridge University Press, their weight and distribution in each skill. The results showed unfair distribution of the four skills and the eight multiple intelligences. This is due to the nature of the English language unit where certain intelligences are more appealing. It is recommended that curriculum designers give nearly equal weight to the four skills especially in general English courses and include as many MIs-based activities as possible. This variety is of great importance to students as teachers guarantee that no learning styles among students are left behind. © 2019 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the raters’ agreement and the effect of raters’ and targets’ gender on self-and parental intelligence assessments in the sample of Croatian twins. Twins were asked to assess their own and their parents’ overall intelligence, as well as specific abilities from the Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. Data was analysed to explore: i) twins’ agreement in parental assessments and behavioural genetic analysis of the overall intelligence estimates; ii) gender differences in self-assessments; and iii) raters’ and targets’ gender effects on parental assessments. The twins’ mean correlation in their assessments of overall parental intelligence was .60. The differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations were nonsignificant for all of the estimated abilities, and model fitting analysis indicates that hypothesis about genetic effect on parental assessment of intelligence should be rejected. The hypotheses about males’ higher self-assessments for overall intelligence and for the masculine types of abilities-logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities-were confirmed. For the feminine types of abilities-verbal/linguistic, inter-and intra-personal intelligences-there were no significant gender effects. Both target and rater effect were found for the parental estimates of intelligence. Fathers were estimated higher on overall intelligence, logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, while mothers were estimated higher on interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. The effect of the raters’ gender was found for overall intelligence as well as for inter-and intra-personal intelligences, where males gave higher estimates of parental intelligences than females. © 2020, PsychOpen.

However, there is a lack of evidence of its psychometric properties in diverse population using multivariable techniques and also to corroborate its relationship with other variables of the Social Cognitive Carrier Theory model. The aim of this study is to validate a version of the Professional Interests Questionnaire. 412 students from the last year of secondary education participated in this study. The factorial analyzes corroborated the existence of fifteen sub-scales with a total of 145 items that explain 61,88% of the variance, a Cronbach’s alpha of,945 and an adequate adjustment of the global model (RMSEA=0,061, GIF=0,92) as incremental (AGFI=0,90, NFI=0,86) which ratifies its validity and reliability. Significant relationships between the sub-scales and the self-efficacy dimensions for multiple intelligences are also confirmed. The study provides an appropriate instrument for individual vocational counseling and development of university admission and retention policies.

The studies related to the link between students’ MIs and vocabulary learning strategy (VLS) employment has been carried out in other countries; however, they seem scarce in the Thai context. The study purposed to examine the link between Thai EFL students’ multiple intelligences and the use of vocabulary learning strategies, and discover the VLS predictors. The 381 tertiary-level students in Nakhon Ratchasima Province took part in the study. MI questionnaire and vocabulary learning strategy questionnaire were used as tools. The results showed a low positive correlation between students’ MI profiles and their VLS employment. Furthermore, among diverse sorts of MI, verbal/linguistic intelligence was found to be a critical predictor of all VLS employment (cognitive, determination, memory, social, metacognitive, and affective strategies). The present study suggested EFL teachers strengthen their linguistic intelligence through learning activities and provide active vocabulary learning in a classroom. © 2020, Thammasat University.

	abstract = {Education today means more to acquiring the requisite competencies and skills so that the students are capable latter to work in different cultures and contexts. Mere knowledge and grades are not going to be sufficient for success and impact. Higher education, in particular, must ensure that the students acquire the right attributes. Further, linear approaches to developing nor measuring attributes may also not be enough for long-term success. This is where the theory of multiple intelligence (MI) is relevant as at its historical origin, intelligence tests described and predicted those who would be successful. This theory explains and deals with nine different kinds of intelligence, each independent of the other. Yet, until now, a better understanding of MI theory and its relationship between the acquisition of graduate and professional attributes is missing including how this can facilitate students to develop the right attributes. Hence, through critical analysis of extant literature, focusing on university students in Namibia, the aim of this paper is to explore the development of graduate attributes through MI theory.

	abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to determine the predominant learning style and type of intelligence based on the VARK questionnaire and Multiple Intelligences Questionnaire respectively in second year medical students. Determining the relationship between individual preferences of students, based on their learning style and predominant type of intelligence and the perception of the modified Peyton’s four-step approach used to teach cardiac auscultation. Me t h o d s: The opinion of participants 236 of the modified four-step approach was attained through the use of anonymous questionnaires. Using the VARK questionnaire, the participants’ learning style was defined. The predominant type of intelligence was determined by the Multiple Intelligences Question-naire. Results: The kinesthetic style was the predominant unimodal learning style in second year medical students (in Polish and international students). The most predominant type of intelligence in Polish students was visual-spatial and mathematical and logical, while in international students the predominant types were visual-spatial and mixed type of intelligence. Quantitative analysis indicated that the modified Peyton’s approach is a valuable learning and teaching method for most students, independent of their predominant learning style or intelligence type. The exception was a small group of students with linguistic intelligence predominance according to the Multiple Intelligence Questionnaire, for which the Peyton method was more difficult. Conclusions: This study proves that the modified Peyton’s approach is useful and effective didactic tool and can be successfully applied to most students. This is a new learning strategy for teaching cardiac auscultation in laboratory conditions in classes for a significant majority. Due to the fact that a group of students with a predominance of linguistic intelligence more often perceived the Peyton method to be difficult, it is worth combining traditional methods with new ones in class so that all students, regardless of unimodal learning style or prevailing type of intelligence, are taught satisfactorily. © 2020, Polska Akademia Nauk.

The authors of this article suggest Grammar Translation Method (GMT) for teaching Malaysian Gifted Learners in reading Arabic text. This article highlights theories of Multiple Intelligences (MI) and academic needs for all gifted learners. Gifted readers read easily and voraciously and with amazing speed and incredible comprehension can comprehend the text that they read. They also are passionate about what they read. For them, reading is not the mere process of translating symbols into meanings but an intense need to explore, investigate, fantasize and make connections with concepts and ideas. However, they need teachers to guide them and this necessitates that they understand the potential advantages for gifted learners when learning language. Apart from that, this article also mentions the different between gifted learners and other learners in understanding the target language.

	abstract = {The concept of intelligence has been debated since its introduction in the early 1900s. Despite criticism that it lacks empirical validity, multiple intelligences (MI) theory (Gardner, 1983), has had sustained interest on the part of educators worldwide. MI theory was one of the first formulations of intelligence to be based on neuroscientific evidence. This investigation reviewed 48 resting-state functionally connected (rsFC) cognitive neuroscience studies. Evidence from whole-brain, model-free studies were compared with regionof-interest, model-dependent studies. Seven to 15 neural networks were found to be well aligned with seven of the eight multiple intelligences as well as general intelligence. These coherent neural networks include many of the same neural regions previously identified by task-based research into the neural bases for the multiple intelligences (Shearer & Karanian, 2017). Accumulating evidence supports the contention that human intelligence is best characterized as being multiple rather than merely singular. These results demonstrate that each person possesses unique and coherent latent neural potentials to process information aligned with the multiple intelligences. Implications for educational cognitive neuroscience are discussed along with suggestions for the personalization of classroom instruction to maximize achievement. © 2020 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Background: Dermatoglyphics is the study of patterns of epidermal ridges on the volar surfaces of the skin. This is said to be associated with multiple intelligences in humans based on the fact that the neocortex and dermatoglyphic prints are developing simultaneously during embryogenesis and they are both genetically determined. Hence this cross-sectional observational study to correlate Emotional Intelligence and dermatoglyphic patterns. A self-evaluating questionnaire was applied on 100 M.B.B.S students, fingerprints of whom were collected using ‘Ink and Paper’ method. The subjects were then categorized into two groups- Category A including subjects with EQ>120; and Category B including subjects with EQ<120. The collected fingerprints were categorized into Plain Arches, Tented Arches, Ulnar Loops, Radial Loops, Whorls and Composite. The data was then tabulated and observed for recurrence of patterns in each category of EQ and was statistically analyzed. Results: In Category A, the most recurring pattern is Ulnar Loop. In Category B, the most recurring fingerprint pattern is Ulnar Loop in all digits except the L4 and R4 in which Whorl is the most recurring type. The chi square test of significance and exact test of association were applied and ‘p’ values were calculated and none of them were <05. Conclusion: The results correspond with the observations made in a previous study correlating dermatoglyphics and IQ amongst medical students. Hence, the aforementioned results may be suggestive of some correlation between dermatoglyphics and EQ. However, the lack of statistical significance may be attributed to the modest sample size. Further research is required in this regard to validate the results of this study. © 2019, Int J Anat Res. All rights reserved.},

However, not all students have positive attitudes towards Information Technology. Besides, there is a number of factors which effects writing ability. Linguistic intelligence may be the one since it has similar characteristics with language learning. This current study is attempted to find out the relationship between students' linguistic intelligence, attitudes towards ICT use, and writing ability. It is conducted in Elementary School Teacher Education Department of Universitas Muhammadiyah Magelang, Indonesia. It involves 26 students of 6th semester as respondents. Questionnaire of Multiple Intelligence Inventory is administered to gather data of students' linguistic intelligence. Students' attitudes are also collected through questionnaire. Data regarding students' writing ability is taken from their essay writing scores. Data analysis employs Pearson Product Moment test. Statistical calculations show that partially students' linguistic intelligence has no relationship, yet students' attitudes have significant and positive relationship to writing ability. Simultaneously both variables have adequate relationship to writing ability. Hence, when linguistic intelligence and students' attitudes towards ICT use are taken into account in designing writing activities, they will probably contribute 30% from all factors. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.

	abstract = {Reading should start from the birth of a baby. American society emphasizes the importance of reading to babies and toddlers since it lays a good foundation for their future reading and study. At the same time , the leading role of public libraries is also strengthened in reaching such goals in the United States. The reading programs towards babies and toddlers are participatory and interactive educational activities embodied with various reading elements , aiming at improving children's comprehensive and healthy development in their early stage. The reading programs focus on cultivating and strengthening children,s early development of literacy skills enlarging their syllables and vocabularies as much as possible and preparing them for their preschool , kindergarten and school life in the future. Considering the current usage , parents, vital roles in raising and cultivating children,s reading and learning habits , parents , as well as their children aged 0 to 3, should be the audiences of babies and toddlers, reading programs. Thus , American public libraries encourage parents to do simple interactive activities with their children every day , such as parent-child talking , singing, reading , writing and playing together. In addition , parent-child reading activities vary in forms and contents and are designed based on children,s different features with different ages , and the different age children cover from newborns infants/babies toddlers to young children. All the children can enjoy their reading activities and cultivate life-long learning interests. There are several babies and toddlers' reading programs widely carried out in the United States. Some common parts have been involved in all these interactive activities , such as repetition , ritual , a fun and positive environment , play , movement , music etc. These programs have fully absorbed some core theories in the fields of psychology social science , education , art and others , and cultivated and strengthened children,s basic preschool literacy skills. The core theories are the theory of multiple intelligences , theories of emotional and social intelligence , seven essential life skills every child needs , scaffolding , schemas and cognitivism , active learning , purposeful play , scientific experimentation , the listen , like , learn , etc. In order to promote babies and toddlers, reading programs and cultivate everyone's reading habits gradually in China , public. libraries should be the most important institution , and play an important role in designing , organizing and carrying out the parent-child reading activities regularly and recommend related resources to the parents. Other initiatives , such as exploring more and pertinent programs for babies and toddlers , helping parents launch the parent-child reading activities are effective in promoting babies and toddlers, reading programs and realizing children’s comprehensive development in China. 37 refs. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Methods: A social skills development program based on Gardner’s Multiple Intelligence Theory was used. The data were collected using the Social Skills Assessment Scale (SSAS), a Chart to Monitor Verbal and Behavioral Violence in Children, the Parental Attitude Scale and the Parent Interview Form. This quasi-experimental study that included a pretest, posttest, and control group had a sample comprising 67 children and parents, with 36 in the experimental group, and 31 in the control group. Results: Over a six-month period, while the social skill scores of the children in the experimental and control groups increased, their violent behaviors decreased (p<.050). Increase in social skill scores and decrease in violent behaviors were higher in the experimental than in the control group children (p<.050). The parents in the experimental group stated that they had started to empathize with their children, using “I” language, and applied rules more consistently after the program. Conclusion: This program was successful in preventing violent behaviors in children through the development of social skills. Hence, it can be effectively implemented through a teacher/nurse collaboration. © 2019 Korean Society of Nursing Science.},

To protect users, cyber-security awareness materials should be readily available to guide users understanding of the vulnerabilities existing in their technological devices; explore the plethora of tactics carried out by hackers to steal their data, and identify measures they can take to ensure their safety as they utilize their devices. The objective of this work is to develop cyber-security awareness materials in Google Classroom using instructional technology design principles to accommodate user learning styles while increasing cyber-security expertise. We create two courses, one focusing on introductory level cyber-security concepts and the other on advanced cyber-security concepts. Topics discussed in the module include threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, risk management, cryptography, software security, and computer networks. Instructional design models and principles such as Universal Design Learning (UDL), Paivio’s Dual Coding, Mayer and Anderson’s Contiguity Principle, and Howard Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences are applied to the development of the module’s content in an effort to accommodate user learning styles and technical expertise. Following the completion of the development of the two cyber-security courses in Google Classroom, we concluded that the courses are progressive steps to creating readily available cyber-security awareness materials for the general public. © International Association for Computer Information Systems.

Specifically, the study sought to accomplish the following objectives: (1) identify the kind of intelligence these teachers possess; (2) identify the level of job performance of public secondary school teachers in the District of Don Carlos; (3) find out the level of multiple intelligences categorized as: bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, naturalistic and spatial; (4) determine the level of performance according to their multiple intelligences when grouped according to: age, income, educational attainment, gender, civil status, number of children and cognitive designation; (5) determine the significant relationship between the teachers’ multiple intelligences and their performance and personal profile; and (6) determine which of these multiple intelligences singly or in combination influence the performance of the public secondary school teachers. Ninety four teachers from the District of Don Carlos served as respondents of the study. Mean, frequency counts, percentages, ANOVA, correlation and regression analysis were the statistical tools used. Results of the study revealed that 81 teachers or more than the majority (86.2%) has a very Satisfactory performance from their Performance Appraisal System for Teachers (PAST). In terms of Multiple Intelligence, the respondents possessed the following intelligence ranked from the highest to lowest; first is intrapersonal intelligence, second is spatial, third is bodily-kinesthetic, fourth is interpersonal, fifth is naturalistic, sixth is musical, seventh is linguistic and the eight in rank is logical-mathematical. As to their mental ability test score, (70.2%) they are Average in their cognitive designation. Through ANOVA, when grouped according to multiple intelligences; educational attainment, income and cognitive designation came out to have significantly related with their performance. Of cognitive designation, further analysis shows a significant relationship between spatial and intrapersonal intelligence with their performance. When the performance was correlated with the teachers’ multiple intelligence and their personal profile the results showed that all multiple intelligence namely naturalistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic and intrapersonal are not significantly related with their job performance. Three out of seven variables of personal profile were found to be significantly related with their performance. These variables are educational attainment, income, and cognitive designation from the mental ability test score. The regression analysis explained the educational attainment, cognitive designation from mental ability test score and naturalistic intelligence are the factors that significantly influence their performance. © 2019.

	abstract = {Generally, oral storytelling is an ancient art of telling stories that has been passed down from generation to generation while digital storytelling incorporates technology which consists of various multimedia modes such as graphics, audio, texts, videos and animations. This paper analyses the differences between the two strategies by discussing their differences in four aspects: (1) the use of technology, (2) the role of storyteller, (3) the approach of process and product, and (4) the engagement of audience. The analysis aims to create awareness among academicians about these differences and highlight that digital storytelling is the combination of both the art of storytelling and digital story. Then, this paper provides a critical review of empirical studies on the potentials of using digital storytelling in teaching and learning for education. The results have shown that the use of digital storytelling is not only beneficial in developing the teachers’ content, pedagogical and technological knowledge, but also in enhancing their students’ learning as it increases their understanding of content and caters for their multiple intelligence. This study suggests the implementation of digital storytelling in teaching and learning in the classroom and future directions for research are suggested.

In addition, the impact of learner variables of resiliency, language learning strategy use, multiple intelligences, and language learning aptitude on the participants’ wellbeing was investigated. The elements of wellbeing in narratives written by students were found to be emotional responses, accomplishments, meaningful engagement, and relationships in a descending order. Hierarchical multiple regression showed resiliency, language learning strategy use, multiple intelligences, and aptitude (but not gender) affected wellbeing. While male students used accomplishments, meaningful engagement, emotional responses, and relationships as their coping, their female peers used emotional responses, accomplishment, meaningful engagement, and relationships. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Cognitive organizers (COs) are text aids which represent objects, concepts, and their relations by the use of symbols and spatial arrangements without adding to semantic content. The present study examines language learners’ text comprehension through outlines, a popular CO, compared with text-only condition, and further investigates the effect of learner-constructed outlines (i.e., systematic note-taking) and expert-constructed outlines (i.e., readymade displays) on comprehension. Finally, the predictive power of multiple intelligences (MI) across different input modalities is scrutinized. Following strati-fied random sampling, a total of 111 EFL undergraduates were divided into text-only (receiving a text twice), expert-constructed (the text followed by an outline), and learner-constructed (the text followed by an outline to be drawn up by the learner) groups. A TOEFL examination, a 1218-word expository text on systematic sleep disorder, a follow-up reading comprehension test, and a multiple intelligences inventory constituted the data collection measures. The results of multiple regression and ANOVA were as follows: (a) COs lead to more content recall than text displays; (b) expert-constructed and learner-constructed outlines are equally effective; (c) MI significantly predicts the groups’ reading comprehension; (d) interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences are significant correlates of text-only groups’ performance; and (e) visual, verbal, and intrapersonal intelligences are significantly associated with learner-constructed groups’ reading scores. The study offers several implications for theory and practice. © 2020, Adam Mickiewicz University Press. All rights reserved.},

Further inquiry into constructs such as creativity, intelligence and scholastic abilities, and understanding how they relate to each other, can promote better understanding of the variables involved in academic achievement. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to examine the predictive value of creativity and multiple intelligences (self-per-ceived, perceived by families and by teachers) in scholastic aptitudes related to academic achievement in primary education. Method. For this purpose, 98 third- and sixth-graders from several schools of the north of Spain completed different tests: an objective test of creative intelligence (CREA), a scholastic aptitude test (TEA1) and a self-report questionnaire on their perceived multiple intelligences. In addition, parents and teachers also completed a questionnaire on the multiple intelligences of the participating students. Results. The results of the linear regression showed that students' creative intelligence pre-dicted students' non-verbal scholastic aptitudes in part, and that naturalistic, linguistic and log-ical-mathematical intelligences showed some predictive ability of students' general scholastic ability, and of verbal and non-verbal components in particular. Discussion and conclusions. Creativity and some multiple intelligences were predictive of scholastic aptitudes, but not in the same way, and without generalized agreement among the informants. Teachers were taken to be the group that most accurately assessed levels of multiple intelligences that were predictive in this study. © Universidad de Almeria.},

Hence, this research aims to investigate the properties of psychometric test items for MI instruments. That is the Malaysian Checklist for Adult (MyMICA) using the Rasch Measurement Model in the context of delinquent students in primary school. A total of 112 students from eight primary schools in Hulu Langat district, Selangor were involved in this study. Respondents were selected through the purposive sampling technique. The findings proved that a total of 62 items met the main assumptions of the Rasch Measurement Model which are i) item fit, ii) unidimensionality and iii) local independence. Whereas, 19 items have been omitted. The reliability index and the separation index for MyMICA instrument shows a high value. Therefore, this research shall be contributing significantly to the aspects of testing items for MI instruments by using the Rasch Measurement Model. Thus, MI instrument of MyMICA could be applied in the context of delinquent student in primary schools in Malaysia. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

Besides, the improvisation in Madrasah management can be one of efforts to answer several problems regarding to the decline of ethics and morality at present. The ethics and morality are specifically related to the interactions and communications with others. Looking at the present time, the society's behaviours tend to be egoistic-individualistic. Competitions and conflicts are more emphasized than cooperation, friendship, and helpfulness. Accordingly, the major conclusions this study are a teachers have responsibilities to transfer values of kindness with full of affection to students and they should have knowledge and art of teaching. If doing so, teachers can inspire and arouse student's motivation, and optimize the students' multiple intelligences with fun, without any coercion and violence. © Serials Publications.},

This dissertation aims to illuminate whether EI and each of its four components (the skills of perceiving, using, understanding and managing emotions) are negatively related to CA. Past literature indicates that CA, a handicap that harms some people in the society, has a negative impact on personal, professional and academic success and that EI is a skill that can be mastered; hence, the most important contribution of this study is that CA can be overcome or alleviated. The underpinning theories of the research are Theory of Communication Apprehension, Theory of Multiple Intelligences, Social Intelligence Theory and Theory of Emotions. Data for this quantitative study has been collected from over 400 undergraduate university students via a survey containing tests on CA and EI and processed via SPSS. Findings from the research suggest there is an inverse relationship between EI and CA and all the five hypotheses are accepted. However, to ensure generalizability of the results so as to implement new educational policies on EI and CA awareness among Millennials, diverse populations, different locations and more variables need to be tested applying more specific sampling methods. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {With evolving technologies, a way of learning is broaden with availability of open teaching and learning materials. Educators and learners often find relevant resources that can assist them in their respective teaching and learning activities; however, most of the time they are bombarded with redundant and/or low-quality information sources via search engines. In the context of personalised teaching and learning, this becomes even more challenging as the educators and learners are looking for specific resources, for specific concepts, and for specific domain of interest. To add to this complexity, the emergence of Big Data is making the situation even worse as new information is emerging on the web every day; hence, the need for a system assisting in this is becoming more prominent. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to identify suitable teaching and learning resources in order to promote individual learning process. As the text or web data for presenting teaching and learning preferences for educators and learners is imprecise, inconsistent, and non-consensual, the smart learning system has potential to be developed based on fuzzy ontology and fuzzy recommendation engine which can address the uncertain and subjective judgments in determining teaching and learning material and evaluating multiple intelligence. We present research direction towards smart learning using fuzzy systems. © 2018, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The results showed that there was a small number of the learners who used the language effectively to persuade others (rhetoric), who remembered the written and spoken information easily (mnemonic), who were able to deliver information orally and written (explanation), and who reflected language to talk about language itself (metalinguistic). The results of this study are expected to be beneficial for the students, the managers, and lecturers of English education study program in Indonesia to have deeper understanding about the concept of linguistic intelligence as it is one of factors that can influence the success in language learning.

Comprehensive Meta-Analysis and MetaWin programs were used for data analysis. In order to support the meta-analysis, a qualitative dimension including a detailed examination of the thematic aspects of the data was added to the first stage. The data was analyzed via the QSR-Nvivo-8.0 program in accordance with the case study design. In the second stage of the McA, an experimental dimension and the thematic analysis based on students’ views were conducted. The working group was selected from 12th grade high school students and the data obtained from them was considered to be post-complementary information. The process of combining the data in two stages was done in order to reach complementary information in the synthesis stage. The McA is expected to contribute to the extent and reliability of the research. © 2017 EDAM.},

Logistic regression analysis was used to find whether the gender and grade level variables, and optimism, utilization of emotions and the scores of emotion evaluation are statistically significant in defining predominant intelligence areas or not. SPSS 24.0 was used in the data analysis process. The results revealed that while the gender variable and optimism scores are significant variables predicting the determination of individuals in which predominant intelligence is both interpersonal and not, optimism and evaluation of emotions scores are significant variables predicting the determination of individuals whose predominant intelligence is both visual and not. However, the results suggested that demographic variables (gender and grade level) and emotional intelligence scores did not affect kinesthetic, musical, intrapersonal, logical and verbal intelligence areas which were found as the predominant intelligence areas of teachers. © 2019 Eurasian Society of Educational Research.

This research primarily aims to explore the impact of bilingualism and gender on linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences in a sample of monolingual and bilingual high school students (fourth graders) of Fars and Khuzestan provinces in Iran. To fulfill this objective, 448 monolingual and bilingual students were selected from among 67031 students in the 2012-2013 academic year. They were administered Multiple Intelligences Survey questionnaire developed by Armstrong (1993) and the results were analyzed through SPSS software. The findings revealed that the bilingual students rated themselves higher on linguistic and logicalmathematical than monolingual peers. Moreover, the male students gave higher self-estimates for logical-mathematical intelligence than their female peers while female students gave higher self-estimates for linguistic intelligence than their male peers. The results of such studies, which indicate students’ differences on intelligence, may lead to the awareness of curriculum developers and teachers to diversify teaching activities based on learners’ learning styles and intellectual abilities. © 2017, Tarbiat Modares University.

In order to describe this interdisciplinary (transdisciplinary) science, and its positions, as well as the stages and directions of its development, it makes use of the epistemological model formulated by Michel Foucault, in which he draws attention to social, ideological and technological conditions of scientific knowledge (episteme). The opinions of the leading creators and critics of cognitive science, such as George A. Miller, Howard Gardner, Margaret Boden and José Luis Bermúdez are referenced to and analyzed with the use of this model.

Women who assessed their interpersonal intelligence as high, scored higher in spatial ability, extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness, and lower in neuroticism and personality disorders against those women who assessed their interpersonal intelligence as low. However, those men with high interpersonal self-efficacy showed higher scores on temperament and lower scores in paranoid and dependent disorders than men with low self-efficacy. There were gender differences in intelligence for the higher group in interpersonal intelligence, and in temperament for the lower group. Considering gender and personality factors in assessment and promotion of interpersonal intelligence is suggested.},

	abstract = {Teaching tourism at high school level has remained a challenge in rural KwaZulu-Natal high schools mainly due to inadequately trained teachers, a shortage of resources, lack of exposure to the tourism industry for both rural learners and teachers and the low perception of the subject due to its misunderstood importance towards university entrance. The paper investigated the viewpoints of the learner of the value of fieldtrips in the teaching and learning of tourism at a high school level. The theories underpinning the study were experiential learning and the multiple intelligences which respectively focus on instrumentalism of learning and provision of opportunities to engage all learners at least some of the time. The paper describes how learning is translated into practice during fieldtrips which cater for multiple intelligences thus impacting positively on learning and achievement of learning outcomes. The study used a quantitative approach to data collection and analysis. The aim of the paper was to determine the educational value of fieldtrips in tourism education at a high school level using schools in Pholela Circuit in KwaZulu-Natal. Data was collected from a purposive sample of 142 Grade 12 learners from all the high schools offering tourism in the circuit and data was analyzed using SPSS version 24.0. The results of the study revealed that there were various positive benefits that could be realized from tourism fieldtrips for both the rural teachers and students perspectives. The study also disclosed that fieldtrips could lead to effective achievement of a variety of learning outcomes and at the same time, transform the attitudes of the learners towards the subject, enhance performance in the classroom and help expedite work placement and completion of the Practical Assessment Task. © 2018 AJHTL.},

The study was conducted in 2015 with an empirical sample of 1,262 students aged 11 to 15. A vast majority of these students (86.9%) played digital games regularly. Early adolescent females spent on average 8.7 h per week playing digital games, while males spent an average of about 17.7 h per week playing digital games. Students with higher scores in Interpersonal intelligence section spent more time playing digital games, while those with higher scores in Visual/spatial and Natural intelligences section played less. Most of the students (41.6%) played digital games longer than five years. Early adolescent males favored Arcade and Sports games, while females preferred Logic, Online and Adventure game genres. Arcade (Action/Shooter/Platform) and Adventure games were preferably played by students with higher scores in Logical/ mathematical intelligence, and Sports (Fighting) games were preferably played by students with higher scores in Bodily/kinesthetic intelligence. Strategy games were a preferred genre for students with lower scores in Musical/rhythmic intelligences. These findings support the notion that individual psychological characteristics lead to media selection and behavioral patterns construction. Vice versa, playing the preferred game genre will probably further motivate players to enhance the specific set of skills, strategies and habits. © 2017, FACTEACHEREDUCATION. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A large body of research work demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of adapting a learning game to its players. This process is driven by understanding the differences between individuals in terms of abilities and preferences. One of the rather interesting but least explored approaches for understanding individual differences among learners is Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI). Gardner suggests that people exhibit multiple dimensions of intelligence or abilities. In the literature, it is suggested that people with different types of intellectual strengths (intelligences) often exhibit clear preferences toward specific modalities and types of interaction and content in relation to learning. This raises the question whether this knowledge could be transferred and employed in adapting learning games to players, more in particular for the purpose of improving the game and/or learning experience, as well as the learning outcome of the players. Although various claims regarding the existence of a relationship between MI and games have been made, none of them are substantiated with empirical evidence. This paper presents the results of an empirical study that has led to evidence-based mappings between the different dimensions of intelligences proposed in MI and the fundamental building blocks of games, i.e. game mechanics. These mappings indicate which game mechanics suit which MI dimensions, and can therefore act as design guidelines when designing games targeting people exhibiting dominance for specific MI dimensions. A tool that visualizes these mappings and facilitates their use in the design of such player-centred (learning) games is also presented. © ACPIL.},

One of the methodological modalities of Arts-Based Research is A/r/tography, which appeared in 2003 driven by Rita Irwin, as a coherent and balanced unification of artistic, educational and research purposes. Its fundamental methodological concepts are vital inquiry, metaphors and metonymies, reverberations and the search for meaning in the combination of texts and images. Both Arts-Based Research and A/r/tography used any artistic specialty (dance, literature, music, theatre, visual arts, etc.), therefore become the meeting zone between qualitative methodological innovations in human and social sciences, and the community based and participatory trends of contemporary art, such as 'Artivism'. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The traditional model relied on a largely standardised, “one size fits all” approach which assumed that developing legal reasoning through attendance at lectures and participation in tutorials and seminars would produce a successful lawyer. However, today’s law schools are adapting to a large and diverse body of law students, many of whom will move on to careers outside the legal profession. This is being recognised by an increasingly pluralistic approach within undergraduate legal education, aided in no small measure by a greater focus on skills. This article will discuss the theory of multiple intelligences, which rejects the idea of a single measure of intelligence and instead identifies a number of different intelligences with both biological and cultural underpinnings. It is argued that acknowledging these multiple intelligences and using them as an organising concept to vary and diversify teaching and learning methodologies could help to further avoid the “one size fits all” approach and enhance the student experience. © 2015 The Association of Law Teachers.},

The study first emphasizes the need to facilitate students as multiple intelligences by online education systems and then suggests a framework of the advanced form of learning analytics i.e., multimodal learning analytics for tracing and facilitating multiple intelligences while they are engaged in online ubiquitous learning. As multimodal learning analytics is still an evolving area, it poses many challenges for technologists, educationists as well as organizational managers. Learning analytics make machines meet humans, therefore, the educationists with an expertise in learning theories can help technologists devise latest technological methods for multimodal learning analytics and organizational managers can implement them for the improvement of online education. Therefore, a careful instructional design based on a deep understanding of students' learning abilities, is required to develop teaching plans and technological possibilities for monitoring students' learning paths. This is how learning analytics can help design an adaptive instructional design based on a quick analysis of the data gathered. Based on that analysis, the academicians can critically reflect upon the quick or delayed implementation of the existing instructional design based on students' cognitive abilities or even about the single or double loop learning design. The researcher concludes that the online education is multimodal in nature, has the capacity to endorse multiliteracies and, therefore, multiple intelligences can be tracked and facilitated through multimodal learning analytics in an online mode. However, online teachers' training both in technological implementations and adapting educational theories to online education is necessary to achieve this ideal.},

	abstract = {“Design convergence talent” (DCT) refers to a person who is talented in creative-convergence design and possesses a degree in design or a related field. By analyzing typical and distinctive characteristics of DCTs, this study explored the depth of intelligence-based creativity. To identify DCTs, subjects were classified into four groups according to convergence (single or multiple domains) and college major (design or non-design). Creativity was assessed using the something About Myself (SAM) test, and multiple intelligences were rated using the Latent Ability Detection (LAD) test, on the basis of the Multiple Intelligence Theory of Gardner (1983, 1993). The DCT group had the highest creativity scores, followed by the non-design convergence talent (NDCT), design single-major (DSM), and non-design single-major (NDSM) groups. Regarding multiple intelligences, the DCT group was high in spatial and linguistic intelligences but low in interpersonal intelligence. Overall, spatial and linguistic intelligences were positively related to (but did not influence) creativity, while bodily kinesthetic and interpersonal intelligences were negatively related to (but did not influence) creativity. DCTs who had completed at least two design studies were more creative than NDCTs, which was presumably the result of the formation of an individual, creative mindset via the internalization of professionally trained design thinking. The results of this study offer a quantifiable basis for a DCT model as a means of creative-talent activation. At the industry level, the model may be useful for scouting and developing DCTs in order to establish a method of sustainable creation and innovative values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The participants of this research are composed of randomly selected 95 ninth graders, who were divided into two experimental and two control classes. The experimental groups were exposed to lesson plans based on the multiple intelligences for six weeks. In the control groups, traditional instruction was conducted. Force and Motion Achievement Test, Force and Motion Attitude Scale, Revised Student Multiple Intelligences Profile Questionnaire and Students’ Views about MI-based instruction Questionnaire were used as research instruments in this research. As a result of this research, it was found that multiple intelligences based instruction had a significant effect on students’ achievements in the Force and Motion topics. However, multiple intelligences based instruction had any significant effect on students’ attitudes towards force and motion topics. In addition, a large majority of the students in the experimental group found the courses based on multiple intelligences more enjoyable and found more instructive. © 2017, Scientific Methodical Center.

	abstract = {This study is based on the low attention of teachers on students' potential compared to academic ability. Teachers' focus on academic ability as the sole determinant of successful learning causes learning to be incapable of developing the students' potential called Multiple Intelligences (MI), whereas they can be applied to make students enjoy learning as well as develop the potential and thinking skills of students. To overcome this problem, a teaching strategy based on Multiple Intelligences was developed in science lesson. The effectiveness of the teaching strategy was evaluated by pretest-posttest-control-group design. The samples consisted of 124 of junior high school students. Data were obtained from Multiple intelligences test, Science Process Skills (SPS) test, and observation sheets. The hypotheses were tested using t-test, simple linear regression, and one-way ANOVA. The study revealed that Multiple Intelligences strategy has an effect on and can be a significant predictor of the development of students' Multiple intelligences. This study showed an improvement of the SPS, specifically in the questioning ability. The results of this study will change the teaching strategy in the future, from academic ability oriented to be multiple intelligences oriented and focus on the potential of each student. © 2019 OmniaScience.},

	abstract = {Howard Gardner revolutionized the concept of intelligence with his Multiple Intelligences Theory. His vision was widely supported by the educational community, which considers different forms of learning and accessing knowledge. Despite its impact, there is still a lack of development of tools that can easily, practically and reliably evaluate multiple intelligences. This work describes the design, development, and piloting of TOI (Tree of Intelligences) software, a digital tool to evaluate multiple intelligences and perform interventions through video games. The aim of the study is to present the design of the TOI software and test its operation, analysing the distribution of the results game by game and checking whether there are differences according to gender or school year. A total of 372 primary school students participated, aged 5 to 9 years old (M=7.04, SD=.871), from three schools in Asturias and Madrid. The results show that 9 out of 10 games had a normal distribution and that there were no gender differences in most games, but there were differences in relation to the school year. We concluded that due to its operation and design TOI software has the potential be a suitable instrument for the evaluation and intervention of multiple intelligences. © ISSN: 1134-3478.; Howard Gardner revolucionó el concepto de inteligencia con su Teoría de las Inteligencias Múltiples.

Using a Vygotskian social constructivist perspective that emphasizes the social nature of cognition, the purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the processes and products of children’s notations as they notated a song and then taught it to a peer, a multi-level task currently unstudied in the literature. Thirteen Canadian children, aged 5–9 years, without prior music instruction, notated a song learned the previous week, sung it back, explained what they did, and then taught the song to a classmate the following week. The children’s notations, as well as audio and videotapes of them carrying out the multi-level task, provided the primary data; audiotaped conversations with parents, teachers, and a school principal provided secondary data. Analyses generated descriptive and narrative portraits, which demonstrate the increasingly sophisticated representational strategies used by the children from three different age groups as they notated, refined, and taught a song. Select portraits are presented and discussed. Implications for research and practice highlight the value of the research task in eliciting children’s multiple intelligences and collaborative problem-solving skills, and painting more complete portraits of their intuitive and emergent musical and metacognitive understandings. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.},

Analyzing the positive factors that influenced their reading scores in the CSL model, the researchers discovered that motivation was the most important factor affecting their reading scores followed by strategy use. In contrast, strategy use was the most crucial factor that positively influenced their reading scores in the EFL model. In addition, interpersonal intelligence had greater effects on the EFL learners’ motivation than the CSL learners’ motivation.

The tertiary students (n = 467) were 379 females with a mean age of 22.63 years (SD = 6.84) and 88 male students with a mean age of 23.97 years (SD = 6.24). The aim of the research was to establish whether there was a change over the duration of a semester and whether gender was also associated with respondents’ talent ratings. Following multiple intelligence (MI) theory, talents as manifestations of MIs were measured. Each talent was rated on seven concepts of learning. Results showed nine factors emerged in conjunction with the seven conceptions of learning, as they have in previous research. Importantly, there were small but significant differences between the beginning and the end of semester scores of seven of nine talents, indicating coincidental learning. Highest ranking of the talents were self-awareness, language and communication, and social and leadership talents. The ranking of the concepts of learning based on the average contribution to each talent was consistent with previous research, and showed performance and then natural ability to be highest ranking. These findings support the suggestion that tertiary students’ talents improve coincidentally with formal study and is deserving of further research. © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In the last decades, an effort has been made to improve the efficiency of high-level and academic education players. Nowadays, students' preferences and habits are continuously evolving and so the educational institutions deal with important challenges, such as not losing attractiveness or preventing early abandonment during the programs. In many countries, some important universities are public, and so they receive national grants that are based on a variety of factors, on which the teaching efficiency has a great impact. This contribution presents a method to improve students commitment during traditional lessons and laboratory tests. The idea consists in planning some activities according to the students' learning preferences, which were studied by means of two different approaches. The first one was based on Gardner's multiple intelligence inventory, which is useful to highlight some peculiar characteristics of the students on the specific educational field. In the second method, direct interviews, voice recognition, and text mining were used to extract some interesting characteristics of the group of students who participated in the projects. The methods were applied in May 2018 to the students attending the course of Micro-Nano Sensors and Actuators for the postgraduate academic program dedicated to Industrial Nanotechnologies Engineering of the University of Rome La Sapienza. The present paper represents the first part of the investigation and it is dedicated essentially to the adopted methods. The second part of the work is presented in the companion paper dedicated to the presentation of the practical project that the students completed before the exam. © 2018 by the authors.},

The skill prediction system was developed in two phases beginning with the generation of weighted fuzzy rules and then followed by the development of a fuzzy rule-based decision support system. The Mamdani Fuzzy inference model in MATLAB was used in implementing the system using weighted attributes of intelligence and ability to determine skills. The system was tested with hypothetical data based on Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence and was found useful for predicting skills based on the parameters used. The system was validated using early school academic records of 7 randomly sampled undergraduates studying various courses in the university. Though limited entries were used to test the system, the model is robust and can be easily modified to accommodate more entries and rules to predict as many skills as possible. © 2018 Authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the communication tools available to children and young people are complex and they have new applications and resources that are updated at a tremendous speed. Digital devices, besides being used for information, communicative, audiovisual and leisure purposes, can also be integrated into education for educational purposes, taking advantage of the enormous potential of using ICT in classroom and the IT expertise that students have. Integration can generate changes in educational planning in general at the level of content, methodology, roles, evaluation, etc.; taking into account the individual differences of the students. The need to integrate ICT in Primary Education and to attend to the individual differences of students, led us to develop an online educational multimedia resource, which can be accessed from a mobile device, laptop or desktop computer. The platform is based on the concept of Multiple Intelligences proposed by Gardner (1983) and Learning Styles proposed by Kolb(1976), performing exercises, assessments and displaying the theoretical contents according each student's cognitive preferences. This article presents the results of a research study about the motivation of students when experimenting with a multimedia resource from the point of view of two primary education centers. The results indicate that students prefer to be trained on different subjects with an educational resource that takes into account their cognitive profile. © 2017 Red Universitaria de Campus Virtuales.

It is determined that after the application, abilities to control the metacognitive thoughts of the preservice teachers, who were taught with a context-based chemistry teaching method in the chemistry laboratory within the 4Ex2 model, positively changed compared to those included in the control group. Additionally, the results showed that the preservice teachers in the treatment group, who received context-based chemistry teaching within the 4Ex2 model, were more successful; therefore, this model is an effective teaching method. © 2018 Ekip Buro Makineleri A.},

The aim of rehabilitation is to promote the harmonious development of the individual through collaboration between medical and educational sciences, involved in the educability of the whole person, in which the aim is not only functional recovery but also social- reintegration. This "functional synergy" permits the development of the person, and establishes an indissoluble link between functions and attitudes, thus allowing the achievement of the greater possible autonomy. In this way classical and pedagogical rehabilitation may be combined in a single concept of educational action. To realize this integrated educational process it is important to evaluate and promote awareness development, based on the possibilities of brain plasticity and on the presence of multiple intelligences skillfully intertwined each other. Therefore, self-awareness plays a prime role in educational actions for the rehabilitation of persons with severe ABI.},

A total of 60 students participated in the research, 30 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group. In the control group, while the subject “geometric objects” was taught using traditional methods, the same subject in the experimental group was taught by curriculums prepared in accordance with the Multiple Intelligence Theory. The study lasted for 4 weeks together with the applications of test development, pre-test, post-test and course work. The application was performed by researchers. The data obtained from the application were evaluated in the SPSS 22 Program. As a result of the evaluations made, the researchers concluded that the lesson which was taught by using the curriculums prepared according to the Multiple Intelligences Theory had a more positive effect on student achievement compared to the lesson which was taught using traditional methods. © 2018, Sciedu Press.

Writing introductory psychology textbooks is challenging given that authors need to cover many areas they themselves may not be intimately familiar with. This challenge is compounded by problems within the scholarly community in which controversial topics may be communicated in ideological terms within scholarly discourse. Psychological science has historically seen concerns raised about the mismatch between claims and data made about certain fields of knowledge, apprehensions that continue in the present “replication crisis.” The concern is that, although acting in good faith, introductory psychology textbook authors may unwittingly communicate information to readers that is factually untrue. Twenty-four leading introductory psychology textbooks were surveyed for their coverage of a number of controversial topics (e.g., media violence, narcissism epidemic, multiple intelligences) and scientific urban legends (e.g., Kitty Genovese, Mozart Effect) for their factual accuracy. Results indicated numerous errors of factual reporting across textbooks, particularly related to failing to inform students of the controversial nature of some research fields and repeating some scientific urban legends as if true. Recommendations are made for improving the accuracy of introductory textbooks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Literacy (in terms of reading and writing) is no longer at the top of the list of most popular subjects, and this is a concern for teachers who aim at teaching learners to read and write - Art was found to be the most popular subject. Fusing Art and other forms of intelligences can be employed as a strategy to teach literacy and popularise it. © 2020},

It also sought to investigate teachers’ perceptions about the theory of multiple intelligences. To this end, 30 male and female EFL instructors teaching the same textbook with the same method of teaching participated in the present study. To gather the data, three successive sessions of each class were observed and the class activities were recorded through an observation schedule. Semistructured interviews were also carried out to explore the teachers’ perceptions of multiple intelligences. And finally, teachers’ dominant type of intelligence was determined by Multiple Intelligences Checklist. The results of one-way ANOVA and post hoc test revealed that only teachers of logical-mathematical type were influenced by their dominant intelligence type and other intelligence types did not exert a significant influence on the types of activities being implemented in the classes. The results of this study can be a fillip at least for teachers with logical-mathematical intelligence to be careful about their dominant intelligence type, not allowing it to affect their teaching and to compel them to use activities in line with their dominant intelligence. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

The central part of the article focuses on the ontological and pedagogical value of stories and narrative knowledge, highlighting their motivational and epistemological relevance, their role in identity formation and establishing existential meaning, openness and the ethical dimension of accepting otherness, the political dimension of education as a process of subjectification, and the importance of stories as a therapeutic way of dealing with personal and social traumas. The conclusion stresses the importance of stories in education both as an illustration of deductive knowledge and as a unique form of fostering inductive/experiential knowledge, the latter being sadly neglected in schools today.},

Respondents were asked to gauge lecturers' practices of employing different methods and strategies to promote multiple intelligences and holistic learning styles and to indicate what their preferences were concerning methods that could be employed more often. Results show that lecturers promote holistic learning, despite prominence of practices that are more tied to logical and analytical skills, in the left hemisphere, with less emphasis on right hemisphere processes such as ludic activities, drama and simulations, and physical involvement. Such results point to the need for the promotion of professional development efforts towards increased adoption of more holistic learning and multiple intelligences within the bachelor course in Psychology. © University of Deusto.},

Research now indicates that certain talented populations that are composed of multiple exceptional individuals are excluded from talent development programmes. Recognizing how well the environment best fits individual needs at particular key developmental moments, shifts the emphases of focus regarding gifted education significantly. The provision for, and the development of, multiple exceptional gifted individuals from this perspective can engender far greater possibilities than previously imagined earlier. In Hungary, we started to create innovative networks for the encouragement and the development of effective, inclusive provision. The networks have however replicated many of the problems of the former provision for talented individuals and groups. The further development of content and appropriate forms of programmes need to be synchronized through networks of innovative provision and evaluation. The proposed complex provision is suggested as a solution for the new forms of talent development that are open to the multiple exceptional gifted population regardless of the populations’ needs being understood, and perceived by, different audiences as being variously extreme, diverse and novel. A system utilizing key aspects of Bloom’s taxonomy, Renzulli’s enrichment triad and Gardner’s multiple intelligences is proposed. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Recent research on students’ multiple intelligences, self-efficacy, and language learning strategies has provided evidence for the development of crucial constructs and generalizations which have direct applications to language classrooms. The present study examined the interrelationships between the strategies language learners take, their level of self-efficacy, and the types of their intelligences (based on Gardner’s (1983) Theory of Multiple Intelligences). To do so, Nation’s (1990) 50-item multiple- choice vocabulary test was administered by a university department to form homogeneous groups across all the majors of the department. Then, three surveys were adapted to explore the links between (1) Self-efficacy in Reading (SER) (Prat-Sala & Redford, 2010), (2) a Multiple Intelligence Scale (Armstrong, 1993), and (3) Oxford’s (1990) Language Learning Strategies. The most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was that self-efficacy had no significant correlation with multiple intelligences. However, as expected, there was a significant correlation between language learners’ perceptions of their self-efficacy and their language leaning strategies. Additionally, a multiple regression analysis indicated notable results on the use of self-efficacy and multiple intelligences to predict language learning strategies. © 2004 AsiaTEFL.org.

Identifying child's potential in early age is important for teaching purpose since every child has difference intelligence and interest. Therefore children's teaching and learning process should be delivered based on child's interest and intelligence, instead of forcing children to excel in every subject. We propose our research to identify child's intelligence by designing fuzzy expert system. The system works based on several input data of children's multiple intelligences. The fuzzy expert system is developed using 25 input variables and resulted in 9 output variables. The system classifies the result based on 9 types of intelligence in human, where each exhibits different level. We produce 81 rules with fuzzy set of three different levels value (high, moderate, or low) for every kind of intelligence. The result of this research is very useful to help parents and teachers for determining their method of teaching based on children's potential. © 2018 Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.},

	abstract = {Today more and more Japanese architects and architecture students tend to value hands-on learning in Built Environment Education (BEE) for children and youth. This movement is for nurturing public awareness of architecture. It is also for caring the diversity of social roles of architects and the diversity of career choices of architecture students. To provide theoretical aspects of BEE into the practical movement, this case study investigated an American BEE curriculum named "Architecture and Children" and its background, through related papers, the curriculum itself and the interview with the curriculum author, Anne P. Taylor, Ph.D. The "Architecture and Children" curriculum was introduced to Japan in 1990. It was widely spread among many architects and educators, because of its introduction with the Core Poster showing the concrete set of practices and its flexibility to correspond with classes in Japanese schools. Analyzing the curriculum and some concepts installed in it by Taylor from art, architecture, pedagogy, cognitive science and environmental ethics, this study organized philosophies of Taylor's learning environment design and architectural design education into 4 areas: Relationalism, Habitability Framework (Whole Learner), Multiple Intelligences and Deep Ecology. Especially, Habitability Framework (Whole Learner) considering human factors and effects of physical environment on learning was brought as her original idea when she started her career with architectural education. Through the investigation of philosophy and pedagogy of applied learning, she found the relationship between learning environment and learning process. Taylor clearly introduced Relationalism, Habitability Framework (Whole Learner) and Multiple Intelligences into the organizing system of the curriculum. Through that system she set concepts, skills and architectural context to be learned in each lesson. She let children work as architects in their classroom to solve the 'real' problem of the 'real' clients with their skills. She also used her skill of visual communication to show the relationships between her curriculum and the national education curriculum. However, Deep Ecology was not so much mentioned in the curriculum itself. Then the interview with Taylor was conducted to investigate her research background deeply. In her early work in 1960-70s she was influenced by land artists in the U.S. At that time environmental issues were severely claimed in the country. Educators emphasized environmental education to deal with environmental issues and to introduce it into the basic education as a tool of integrated studies. Many artists and art pedagogues also contributed to this social movement, and Taylor was one of such art pedagogues as well. As she pointed out in her interview, Taylor got influenced by land artists such as Robert Smithson. They took holistic approach toward environmental issues, including the built, natural and cultural environment. The common point was found out between land artists and 'the grandmas of environment education in the U.S.' including Taylor. The point was that they sifted their social roles by taking environment into their works as a new subject. They found the problem in classical art and some kinds of contemporary art which were consumed easily in economic societies. Land artists and art pedagogues including Taylor absorbed a lesson from environmental issues and created the new field of art, architectural design and education. Through that insight, she redefined her profession considering architectural education and developed the new form of interdisciplinary art education. If its educational aspect for her was taken into account, she was the person concerned (Tojisha) of the educational process she made. Here in Japan a lot of BEE practices are conducted, however, not so much curricula with concrete theories and philosophies are found. It is the prime task to enhance transdisciplinary researches on BEE to introduce its academic value into architectural science. It is important for civic and child education, but also important for architects as educators, because they can be learners in the educational process they make. Through that process, they can redefine their professions and create the new field of architecture. © 2018 Architectural Institute of Japan. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since the creation of the IQ test in the 1900s, there has been an increase in research about what intelligence is and how it works. Initially, the term “intelligence” was defined as a unitary trait that can be measured. However, it was not until 1983 that the psychologist Howard Gardner changed that view in his book “Frames of Mind.” Gardner challenged the traditional view of intelligence, establishing a different definition of intelligence, a definition that revolutionized the academic world, making headway for future investigations. The following study is a preliminary analysis of long-term research. The focus of the study was to observe the use of “Project Spectrum” activities in an English class taught as a second and foreign language and the improvement in curricular competencies, learning, and performance of fifth-grade foreign language students in a Puerto Rican public school. Data collection was performed over a period of five months using English subject tests established by the scholar curriculum. The results revealed the existence of a distinct trend toward significance in the comparison of two groups (experimental and control). Based on the results, the investigation obtained positive outcomes. The implementation of the “Project Spectrum” activities will cause a change in the improvement of the curricular competencies, learning, and performance of the foreign language students. Still, to obtain a greater significance in the results, it is necessary to continue the study until the end of the course year. © Common Ground, Pierette Bartolomei-Torres, Eva M.

This study reveals the perception of teachers in their initial training on the use of 3D technology and the development of creativity. This work is the result of the training actions undertaken by the Dream Makers Project. It is an international Key Action 2 project of Cooperation for Innovation and Exchange of Good Practices. Dream Makers is a research-action project based on three basic elements: multiple intelligences, creativity and 3D emerging technology. METHOD. The participants were 101 students (N=101) who were given three Likert tipe scales to assess the degree of satisfaction and perception of different aspects of their training. The variables studied were motivation, relevance, clarity and realism/practicality of the contents of the learning programmme. RESULTS. The results obtained showed a high interest in 3D emerging technology. 96% of the participants perceived the contents of the programme as highly relevant to their professional future. 85.5% found the topic very real and practical. The motivation most selected by the participants was to acquire new skills, with 74% of the students who chose this option. DISCUSSION. The results predict highly positive expectations for the use and implementation of 3D technology in Early Childhood Education classrooms in the not too distant future. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.},

A total of 209 Angolan (109 women and 100 men) and 183 Timorese (89 women and 94 men) students were participated in this study. Participants completed a questionnaire in order to estimate their parents', partners' and own overall intelligence and the 8 reversal multiple intelligences (telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery and alloic sympathy intelligence). Respondents also rated 6 questions about intelligence. Men rated their overall, conformist and autic mastery higher than women. Angolans rated their overall, telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery and alloic sympathy intelligence higher than Timorese. In both countries, fathers have been perceived as more intelligent than mothers, and telic intelligence emerged as a significant predictor of overall intelligence. Principal component analysis of the 8 reversal multiple intelligences yielded one factor. Angolan participants revealed more IQ test experience than Timorese participants. Most of respondents in both countries did not believe in sex differences in intelligence.

	abstract = {The method is one of the important legs of the education system and the teaching program. Selecting a more effective method in teaching can also make the teacher more effective at the same time. Multiple Intelligence Theory can be seen as one of the theories providing important alternatives to education and teaching methods. The method variety offered by this theory includes museum education. Many different functions can be mentioned depending on the purpose of the establishment. However, museum education is very important and necessary in terms of contemporary teaching methods as well as traditional education. Museum education can not be considered limited only to the education given in the museum. Multi-Intelligence Theory is also an important place in terms of both museum education and visual arts education as an understanding of student- centered education and individual differences. The purpose of studying this; to examine museum education as a method of visual arts education from the perspective of Multiple Intelligence Theory, to draw attention to the necessity of museum education in this context and to present suggestions depending on this purpose.},

	abstract = {The process of decision support for higher education institution to determine the concentration of study program becomes a significant problem because the student needs to analyse their interest, ability, and other factors as the qualification. A mistake in decision-making will be detrimental to the students' education level, and it can even affect their future. This is a problem that occurs every semester, not only within the scope of the faculty but also in the university. Therefore, this research proposes a model to ease the higher education institution in determining a concentration of student using AHP and TOPSIS method. AHP method is a decision support system that can give weight on criteria of concentration and test its consistency. This method is to give weight for each criterion of student concentration majoring in Information System. TOPSIS method has a concept that the appropriate alternative has the shortest distance with a positive ideal solution and has the farthest distance with a negative ideal solution. Moreover, the criteria for choosing the concentration are multiple intelligences, GPA, course score, and TOEFL score. Weights obtained from AHP become the input value in the TOPSIS method in sorting the alternatives to be selected. Then, the result of the sorting is being calculated for its accuracy level. Based on the calculation of 93 sample of student's concentration with AHP-TOPSIS method, 62 data are the same, so it results in the accuracy of 67%. An application with AHP-TOPSIS method can be used to help the university management in determining the concentration at Information System major for XYZ University. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

	abstract = {This Paper Explores (1) The Issue and problem of using self access material that the learner can be done (2) potential models and process in language Learning (3) the areas of autonomy in assessment development, application, decision - making to independent action. The terms "Autonomy" and "Self Direction" are being used more frequently in educational to discussion. This article identifier and examines the factors which contribute to these, including the minority rights movement, shifts in educational philosophy, reactions for or against behaviorism, linguistic pragmatism, access to educations increase the commercialization educational material for teaching greater availability of current technologies. A number of objection to "Autonomy" (It could not work with children or adult at low educational attainment not for difficult language, or in examination led Syllabus) have largely overcome, research into a wide range of educational topics, such as learning styles and strategies, resources centre and counselor and leaner training has directly contributed to present practice much remains to be explored. However, particularly cultural influenced on language learning. Learner autonomy has long been defines as the ability to take charge of one's own learning (Holic, 1981) in Other words, learners must be independent from others instruction and directing in order to develop autonomy (Benson, 1996). Teachers hold positive attitudes towards the promotion of learner's autonomy in language as the facilitators, counselor, and variable resources (Dujng and Sheepo, 2014). Learner Autonomy as a subject for research and as an educational goal, has gamed a lot of traction in recent years. Autonomy is now a common theme at conferences and in professional journals and is well on the radar of the average language teacher. The Idea that learners need to be able to take control over their own learning to be successful not just in class, but to learn independently without a teacher outside the class, has become widely accepted in mainstream language teaching (Benson, 2001). Breen's process syllabus (1987) and Nunan is (1988) Learner centered approach are examples of this. More recent approaches to learning and teaching, such as task based language teaching include elements that can support the development of autonomous learning skills (Errey & Scholart, 2005) in general, there is now a broader awareness at importance of developing language and autonomous learning skills in addition to the language competencies. The development of learner autonomy is sometimes carried out through 'Leaner training" or dedicated strategy instruction often through self-Access centers (Gardner of Miller, 2014). Most likely autonomous learners are those who explicitly accept responsibility for their own learning (e.q. little, 1991) the autonomous shows initiative in the learning process and share in monitoring. Progress and evaluating the extent to which learning is achieved (Schurk, 2005). There is a need to make students aware of the hidden potential within each and to find ways in which this can be explored when students become more autonomous and involved in their own learning, take an active part in making decisions. This may result in students feel a sense of ownership and commitment to the process this learning night be more meaning full, resulting in better classroom performance. There fore, teacher can help students in cover and develop the skills which will allow them to manage their own learning and survive outside the sheltered environment of the classroom, when the teacher is no longer there for support. Research done in the area of second language acquisition suggest how this night be achieved work in language learning in the last half of the twentieth century, has brought is closer to understanding the complex nature of this process. Research in area such is multiple intelligences (gardner, 2010), individual learning stylis and learning strategies (Rus,1978, Cohen,1988, Molley & Chamid;1990), motivation (Dormyei,2001) and cognition (Schimdt,1990, Crass, Svetie & Lemelin,2003) have given us insight into the ways in which deferent factors influence learners and the way they learn. Added to this is the move toward learner-centered father than teacher centered-classroom (Nunan,1999), giving students opportunity to become active participants in the learning process, making decisions with regard to learning objectives and materials to be used, helping decide the evaluation process, and this moving toward becoming independent and autonomous learners. My intention is to provide an overview of issues concerning learner autonomy and other related area which have an influence on self-Access language learning (SALL) We begin by examining the debate surrounding autonomy and identifying the mayor influences which have contributed in this debate. This debate will not be discussed after this chapter because it is not central to the purpose of the problem It is, however, an important starting point for talking about SALL The reminder of the chapter focuses specifically on SALL by identifying its characteristics the beliefs and attitudes which affect the acceptance of SALL The change in roles which is required of both learners and teachers The challenges of promoting speaking in SALL The kinds of learning environment in which SALL can take place Possible areas of resistant to SALL Finally we discuss issues related to the costs of establishing and mounting SALL.},

In this sense, MIT was considered as an explanation variable of the emotional response within the different educational parts (so-called syllabus units, SU) in the Technology spanish curriculum. Different intelligence style (IS) will orient the student to a vision of the engineering and technology. This work tries to identify which relationships can be established between IS and specific technology and engineering learning. This research involved up to 135 students were subsequently tested about their predominant (IS) and on the emotions that arouse in them when working with each SU. The results were statistically significant and only those with a Logic-arithmetic or Environmental IS were not affected by the SU.Best teaching and learning practicesare required for encouraging further engineering studies. © 2017 SEFI.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, an effort has been made to improve the efficiency of high-level and academic education players. Nowadays, students’ preferences and habits are continuously evolving and so the educational institutions deal with important challenges, such as not losing attractiveness or preventing early abandonment during the programs. In many countries, some important universities are public, and so they receive national grants that are based on a variety of factors, on which the teaching efficiency has a great impact. This contribution presents a method to improve students commitment during traditional lessons and laboratory tests. The idea consists in planning some activities according to the students’ learning preferences, which were studied by means of two different approaches. The first one was based on Gardner’s multiple intelligence inventory, which is useful to highlight some peculiar characteristics of the students on the specific educational field. In the second method, direct interviews, voice recognition, and text mining were used to extract some interesting characteristics of the group of students who participated in the projects. The methods were applied in May 2018 to the students attending the course of Micro-Nano Sensors and Actuators for the postgraduate academic program dedicated to Industrial Nanotechnologies Engineering of the University of Rome La Sapienza. The present paper represents the first part of the investigation and it is dedicated essentially to the adopted methods.

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to synthesize the results of experimental studies which investigated the effect of certain contemporary learning approaches including cooperative learning, multiple intelligence-based learning, problem-based learning, and constructivist learning approach on students’ mathematics achievement via meta-analysis method. In order to collect the data, first the inclusion criteria were determined and a coding form was developed. As a result, the meta-analysis involved 47 experimental studies published between 2005 and 2014, which investigated the impact of contemporary learning approaches on learners’ mathematics achievement. Based on the findings obtained from 2627 subjects who took part in these studies, a synthesis was done about the impact of contemporary learning approaches on mathematics achievement. The analysis based on the random effects model revealed that using contemporary learning approaches have a significant (p< 0.001) impact on mathematics achievement with a large effect size (d=0.93). This finding suggests that using contemporary learning approaches in mathematics lessons is effective in increasing the learners’ mathematics achievement. As a result of the comparisons of common effect sizes between the groups based on random effects model, no statistically significant difference was observed between the specific learning approaches (QBG=6.456, df=3, p=.091) and the school stages (QBG=4.136, df=2, p=.126). Moreover, the metaregression analysis based on random effects model revealed no statistically significant effect of the duration of treatment on learners’ mathematics achievement in the lessons conducted in accordance with the contemporary learning approaches (z=-0.04990, p>.05). However, it was found that group size had a significant negative effect on mathematics achievement in the lessons conducted in accordance with the contemporary learning approaches (z=- 2.12076, p<.05), i.e. as the number of students decreases, the better results are achieved from contemporary learning approaches in terms of learners’ math achievement. © 2017, Hacettepe University.

Our contribution is mainly a two-fold proposition: (1) We adopt the conceptual model of learners’ intelligence, that we have proposed in other paper, and which we enhance by adding multiple intelligence and triarchic intelligence as sub-classes of the ‘intelligence’ class. (2) We adopt a process that aims at (a) acquiring knowledge of an individual learner’s intelligence according to the multiple and triarchic intelligence theories, (b) recommending pertinent collaborators using a mathematical aggregation operator that relies on a fuzzy measure that facilitates consideration of the importance of each criterion as well as its interaction with others. An illustrative example shows the effect of this interaction. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Results: Findings indicated that all students enjoyed the lectures; about 91% of them actively participated in the class; and more than half of the students were found to be more creative in completing the dietetics tasks. The assumption of most students that the subject of dietetics is scourge and difficult, turned into an exciting, relaxed but serious and easy to understand tasks, because students could learn using their own intelligence. The map concept and portfolio assessment trained students to be more thorough and disciplined in doing NCP.

	abstract = {Background: In the history of early childhood education (ECE), language is viewed as key in teaching and learning. Children in the ECE are mostly confined to verbal communication which, to a certain extent, restricts their imagination and inventive ability. Loris Malaguzzi, the founder of the Reggio Emilia educational philosophy, initiated the Hundred Languages of Children (HLC) as a pedagogical approach to enable children to interact and communicate. Aim: This study aims to explore the role of HLC through the experiences and views of the four ECE practitioners in the Gauteng province. Drawing on Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, the author argues that ECE children possess different kinds of minds, and therefore they learn in different ways. Setting: Two Early Childhood centres in the Gauteng Province of South Africa were selected for this study because they had adopted Malaguzzi’s HLC approach to constructing concepts to help children structure knowledge and organise learning. Methods: The author used one-on-one interviews to get ECE practitioners’ experiences on using Malaguzzi’s HLC. To corroborate the interviews’ data, the author conducted classroom observations and document analysis. Results: The participants viewed Malaguzzi’s HLC as an enabler to meet the requirement of the two sets of curricula from the Department of Social Development (the National Curriculum Framework for children from 0 to 4 years) and from the Department of Basic Education (the Curriculum Assessment and Policy Statement for 5-year-old children). Conclusion: The findings show a paradigm shift, as children become active constructors of their own knowledge. © 2019. The Authors.},

Quantitative responses using online surveys were collected from 111 students. Measures included McKenzie's Multiple Intelligences Inventory and the Online Video Experience Inventory. The Online Video Experience Inventory resulted in two sub-scales, namely, motivation and learning experience. Overall multiple intelligences was significantly positively correlated with learning experience but not student motivation. Although the findings revealed a significant difference between the MI profiles of respondents and their age category, it was revealed that all students are lower in Existential intelligence. Further analyses between gender and the MI subscales also indicated significant differences between gender and Logical-Mathematical and Intrapersonal intelligences. However, a negligible significant relationship was found between the two sub-scales of the Learning Experience Inventory and age of the participants.},

This raises difficulties in engaging students in real-life decision-making quandaries where military necessity meets legalism, as well as fundamental ethical questions about the use of realistic, yet explicit, imagery in the classroom. The School of Law at Queen’s University Belfast has developed a series of innovative computer scenarios based on the Arma 3 open world tactical war simulator. A variety of formative scenarios (addressing issues such as cluster munitions and landmines) were developed to familiarise the students with the factual scenario and the computer technology. Subsequently, students engaged in a summative assessment to test their legal understanding in the face of increasingly challenging conflict situations, in particular grey zones where legal argument can justify seemingly morally wrongful acts during war. This paper examines both the learning objectives of this project, and the project development cycle – from the initial proposal to its implementation in class, as well as positing the benefits and drawbacks in integrating technology and games into the legal teaching environment, reflecting on the emerging and traditional pedagogy in this area. © 2017 The Association of Law Teachers.},

Therefore, the method used is descriptive-analytic, explaining the concept of character-based holistic education to get a relevant model. The analysis concludes character-based holistic education into two main points. (1) Character-based holistic education aims to develop student's physical, emotional, social, creative, spiritual, and intellectual aspects optimally. This model combines intellect, emotion, and religion. (2) Implementing characterbased holistic education is conducted through: (a) applying a learning model involving active participation of students. They receive learning materials which are concrete, meaningful, and relevant to their life context; (b) creating conducive learning atmosphere, so students can learn effectively in a safe condition; (c) giving explicit, systematic, and sustainable character education involving knowing the good, loving the good, and acting the good; (d) providing learning based on the principle of multiple intelligences, paying attention to the uniqueness of every student. © Serials Publications Pvt.

After taking into consideration the limits of the current teaching methods, the article examines various theories and approaches that involve questioning the objectivity of the learning process, the concept of multiple intelligences, the concentration on the experience as the focal point of learning and so forth. On the basis of these reflections, and after evaluating various teaching experiences over the past twenty years, the authors make some practical proposals, without imagining a curriculum, but rather by outlining several possible activities within an organic teaching project. To this end, a software program is described and realised in which the learner is engaged through the use of an interactive game format that can be played by the individual or in a group, and that encourages the development of the capacities of analysis, perception, practical skill, knowledge, imagination and creativity. © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

	abstract = {Controllability is a fundamental issue concerning control of multi-agent networks and a very important research topic in the modeling, analysis and coordination control of multi-agent systems. Group controllability problem is a further extension of the controllability problem of the general multi-agent systems, which mainly studies the cooperation and control of multi-agent systems with multiple sub-groups or multiple intelligence clusters. Comparing with the controllability of the general multi-agent systems, the group controllability is not only to consider the information interaction among the groups, but also to consider the information interaction between different groups, which makes the system reflect the effect of a whole and also the internal structure of the sub-groups. This paper addresses the group controllability problems of discrete-time multi-agent systems with time-delay, in which both switching topology and fixed topology are considered. This paper also proposes the general definition of the group controllability, as well as establishes group controllability criteria from the algebraic and graphical perspectives. Numerical examples and simulations are proposed to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2016 The Franklin Institute},

A 2009 survey at our institution revealed that residents saw Spanish-speaking patients regularly and wanted a medical Spanish curriculum designed for them. Our objective was to improve medical Spanish and cultural competency among resident physicians at our institution. Kramsch’s (1998) principle of combining language and cultural instruction, Gardner’s (1983) theory of multiple intelligences, and the American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages 5Cs provided a framework for the self-directed curriculum, which consisted of ninemonth long modules with online and in-person grammar, vocabulary, listening comprehension and conversation practice. We conducted pre-intervention, midterm and final assessments of language and cultural competency. We found moderate correlations between the number of modules completed and self-reported fluency, understanding of health-related cultural beliefs, and change in receptive language. While revisions are necessary, we found a self-directed resident medical Spanish curriculum, combining language and cultural instruction, to be feasible. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

It can be surprising, in this context, to learn that most of what is known about cognitive ability variation across individuals concerns the broadest of all cognitive abilities; an ability referred to as general intelligence, general mental ability, or just g. In contrast, our knowledge of specific abilities, those that correlate little with g, is severely constrained. Here, we draw upon our experience investigating an exceptionally specific ability, face recognition, to make the case that many specific abilities could easily have been missed. In making this case, we derive key insights from earlier false starts in the measurement of face recognition's variation across individuals, and we highlight the convergence of factors that enabled the recent discovery that this variation is specific. We propose that the case of face recognition ability illustrates a set of tools and perspectives that could accelerate fruitful work on specific cognitive abilities. By revealing relatively independent dimensions of human ability, such work would enhance our capacity to understand the uniqueness of individual minds. © 2014 Wilmer, Germine and Nakayama.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the utility of social network analysis methods in the data fusion domain. Given fused data that combine multiple intelligence reports from the same environment, social network extraction and high value individual (HVI) identification are of interest. The research on the feasibility of such activities may help not only in methodological developments in network science but also in testing and evaluation of fusion quality. This paper offers a parallel computing-based methodology to extract a social network of individuals from fused data, captured as a cumulative associated data graph (CDG). To obtain the desired social network, two approaches including a hop count weighted and a path salience approach are developed and compared. A supervised learning framework is implemented for parameterizing the extraction algorithms. Parameters utilized in the extraction algorithm consider paths between individuals within the social network, weighing relationships between these individuals based on the count weighted and the path salience calculation methodologies. An overall link strength value is then calculated by aggregating path hop count weights and saliences between unique individual pairs for the hop count weighted and path salience approaches, respectively. Ordered centrality-based HVI lists are obtained from the CDGs constructed from the Sunni criminal thread and Bath'est resurgence threads of the SYNCOIN data set, under various fusion system settings. The reported results shed light on the sensitivity of betweenness, closeness, and degree centrality metrics to fused graph inputs and the role of HVI identification as a test and evaluation tool for fusion process optimization. The computational results demonstrate superiority of path salience approach in identifying HVIs. The insights generated by these approaches and directions for future research are discussed. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Our research focused on studying the extent to which the planned, systematic use of educational videogames can result in the generation of learning contexts conducive to developing Multiple Intelligences (MIs) amongst schoolchildren. Methodology. A twofold methodological approach was adopted: a) qualitative: previous assessment and analysis of the videogame to be utilized in the experience, giving priority to its suitability and correspondence with primary education curricular areas; b) experimental: case study oriented to verifying the possible increase of MIs amongst pupils enrolled in the First Cycle of Primary Education (N=101) derived from implementing the videogame in the classroom during one academic year, using a control group and identifying the level reached before (test) and after the experience (post-test) with an assessment instrument. Results. The previous selection of a videogame guarantees the acquisition and reinforcement of numerous learning formats linked to specific Primary Education curricular contents. The fun activities -related to all eight intelligences- imply motivating challenges for schoolchildren as well as chances to boost various skills. A widespread increase of all intelligences was observed after the playful-formative experience with the videogame; this became particularly significant in the cases of logical-mathematical, visual-spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence -the first two improving to a greater extent in girls than in boys. Conclusions: The starting hypothesis was verified: the introduction of suitable videogames in the classroom and their systematic exploitation promotes MI development amongst primary education children. In particular, measuring operations, mathematical calculations, counts, shape and size identification and classification, relationships and correspondences, etc., presented in an entertaining way by means of animations, graphics and drawings, together with the activities that promote body care (healthy diet and personal hygiene), facilitate learning and improve MIs. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).},

The second is which technique would be appropriate for learners grouping according to the selected learner model. This paper aims to propose a novel cooperative learning approach using a multiple-intelligence based learners grouping technique. This contribution is three folds: (1) a conceptual model of learners' intelligence, (2) a pre-learning process that aims at: (a) acquiring knowledge of individual learners' intelligence according to the conceptual model of learners' intelligence; (b) grouping the learners into balanced groups based on this intelligence; and (c) calculating knowledge of collective intelligence, useful for cooperative learning during the learning process, and (3) a framework architecture, in order to support the new cooperative learning approach and demonstrate its feasibility. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Self-learning process is an important factor that enables learners to improve their own educational experiences when they are away of face-to-face interactions with the teacher. A well-designed self-learning activity process supports both learners and teachers to achieve educational objectives rapidly. Because of this, there has always been a remarkable trend on developing alternative self-learning approaches. In this context, this study is based on two essential objectives. Firstly, it aims to introduce an intelligent software system, which optimizes and improves computer engineering students’ self-learning processes. Secondly, it aims to improve computer engineering students’ self-learning during the courses. As general, the software system introduced here evaluates students’ intelligence levels according to the Theory of Multiple Intelligences and supports their learning via accurately chosen materials provided over the software interface. The evaluation mechanism of the system is based on a hybrid Artificial Intelligence approach formed by an Artificial Neural Network, and an optimization algorithm called as Vortex Optimization Algorithm (VOA). The system is usable for especially technical courses taught at computer engineering departments of universities and makes it easier to teach abstract subjects. For having idea about success of the system, it has been tested with students and positive results on optimizing and improving self-learning have been obtained. Additionally, also a technical evaluation has been done previously, in order to see if the VOA is a good choice to be used in the system. It can be said that the whole obtained results encourage the authors to continue to future works. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Intelligence could be understood as a system of active operations, which involves a functional continuity between the higher forms of thought and cognitive-motor adaptation to social and physical environment surrounding the subject. (Piaget, 1998) Gardner says that his multiple intelligences, especially that bodily-kinesthetic, develop when the subject is in contact with the outside world, lived experiences and assimilates information. (Gardner, 1988) With this study we would like to underline as it does the development of skills praxic and its evolution over the age of development. 77 students participated in the research, from I to V elementary, to which was administered, individually, a battery of tests. The tests were acquired by the Special Organization of Florence and treated by Rossana De Beni, Gruppo MT, "Q1 elementary": tests for the compilation of initial profile of the new evaluation document. Initial results may prove as there could be a correlation between the age child's cognitive and its ability to perform movements conscious and coordinated; capacity which, according to the data, you can reach to the last years of primary school. The correct motor development, the acquisition of skills praxic and the awareness of their motor pattern, allow the passage from the body as a tool, the own body, through an increasingly refined control of his movements. The praxis, therefore, are acquired through experience and a learning process that allows to establish an intentional relationship between motor, intellectual and emotional phenomena (Le Boulch, 2006). © Faculty of Education.},

	abstract = {Research of the use of creativity in instruction focuses largely on educating intellectually gifted students. However, learning disabilities, and other emotional, intellectual, and physical/brain impairments are not mutually exclusive to giftedness. Rather, many conditions may coexist with giftedness in a variety of modalities. The problem is the tendency of parents, teachers and researchers to view such students through a deficit model. The well-meaning desire to get exceptional students to achieve appropriate grade level goals in light of standardized testing and ever evolving learning standards encourages educators to de-emphasize creativity and multiple intelligences in favor of conventional, rote approaches to learning mandated skills and concepts. The focus of this paper is to examine how to access areas of strength and giftedness in exceptional children through the use of creativity in instruction and the encouragement of creativity in students. The Common Core State Standards are then addressed in a responsible and balanced way that allows exceptional students entry to the curriculum through the unlocking of their individual ways of understanding and processing the world. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop a way of thinking about exceptional students that suggests protocols that encourage creativity in teacher approaches to instruction. © Common Ground, Jelia R.

The participants were composed of 212 fifthand sixth-graders from elementary schools in central Taiwan. Findings indicated that most participants generally experienced a mild level of anxiety in the EFL classroom. However, at least a quarter of the full sample experienced an above-average level of anxiety when learning the target language. These students tended to be most anxious when (1) feeling that other students had better English performance, (2) being called on to speak in the English class, and (3) feeling afraid of being left behind in the English class. Overall, students were most likely to feel anxious due to worry over inadequate language performance and fear of being evaluated negatively by others. Furthermore, the current findings indicated a significant negative correlation between language anxiety and strategy use among the young EFL children. Students who had greater strategy use were less likely to feel anxiety. Interestingly, the use of social strategies had the strongest relationship with language anxiety among the young learners. Another learner variable, multiple intelligences, was found to be significantly related to both strategy use and anxiety; its relationship with strategy use seemed to be much stronger than that with anxiety. All six strategy categories were found to have significant correlations with multiple intelligences. Implications derived from the results are discussed in the paper.},

The authors point 5 domains "Consciousness", "Transcendence", "Grace", "Truth" and "Meaning" that compose the Integrated Spiritual Intelligence Scale [ISIS]. The present investigation aimed to realize a preliminary validation of the Portuguese version of ISIS. A sample of 714 subjects, 257 males and 461 females, aged between 14 and 81 years took part of the study. The implementation of the instruments was performed online and besides the use of Integrated Spiritual Intelligence Scale, we used also a socio-demographic questionnaire in order to characterize the sample. The results showed a Cronbach’s alpha values lying between 0.67 and 0.88. The value of Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale is 0.92. A penta factorial structure was found ("Religious and Spiritual Coping", "Consciousness", "Grace", "Meaning" and "Mission"). In this preliminary version the domains were not congruent with the original scale. Although they are necessary further studies that focus on the convergent and discriminant validity, and a confirmation of the stability of the factor structure obtained in new sample, this work is an important contribution to the review of this new construct, and is assumed as a point of departure for further research in the area of Spiritual Intelligence. © 2016, Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada.

	abstract = {Objective: To measure academic achievement of the multiple intelligence-based learning medium via a tablet device. Material and Method: This is a quasi-experimental research study (non-randomized control group pretest-posttest design) in 62 grade 1 elementary students (33 males and 29 females). Thirty-one students were included in an experimental group using purposive sampling by choosing a student who had highest multiple intelligence test scores in logical-mathematic. Then, this group learned by the new learning medium via a tablet which the application matched to logical-mathematic multiple intelligence. Another 31 students were included in a control group using simple random sampling and then learning by recitation. Both groups did pre-test and post-test vocabulary. Results: Thirty students in the experimental group and 24 students in the control group increased post-test scores (odds ratio = 8.75). Both groups made significant increasing in post-test scores. The experimental group increased 9.07 marks (95% CI 8.20-9.93) significantly higher than the control group which increased 4.39 marks (95% CI 3.06-5.72) (t = -6.032, df = 51.481, p<0.001). Conclusion: Although learning from either multiple intelligence-based learning medium via a tablet or recitation can contribute academic achievement, learning from the new medium contributed more achievement than recitation. The new learning medium group had higher post-test scores 8.75 times than the recitation group. Therefore, the new learning medium is more effective than the traditional recitation in terms of academic achievement. This study has limitations because samples came from the same school. However, the previous study in Thailand did not find a logical-mathematical multiple intelligence difference among schools. In the future, long-term research to find how the new learning medium affects knowledge retention will support the advantage for life-long learning. © 2015, Medical Association of Thailand.

	abstract = {Several adaptive and intelligent tutoring systems (AITS) have been developed with different variables. These variables were the cognitive traits, cognitive styles, and learning behavior. However, these systems neglect the importance of learner s multiple intelligences, learner s skill level and learner s feedback when implementing personalized mechanisms. In this paper, the authors propose AITS based not only on the learner s multiple intelligences, but also the changing learning performance of the individual learner during the learning process. Therefore, considering learner s skill level and learner s multiple intelligences can promote personalized learning performance. Learner s skill level is obtained from pre-test result analysis, while learner s multiple intelligences are obtained from the analysis of questionnaire. After computing learning success rate of an activity, the system then modifies the difficulty level or the presentation of the corresponding activity to update courseware material sequencing. Learning process in this system is as follows. First, the system determines learning style and characteristics of the learner by an MI-Test and then makes the model. After that it plans a pre-evaluation and then calculates the score. If the learner gets the required score, the activities will be trained. Then the learner will be evaluated by a post-evaluation. Finally the system offers guidance in learning other activities. The proposed system covers all important properties such as hypertext component, adaptive sequencing, problem- solving support, intelligent solution analysis and adaptive presentation while available systems have only some of them. It can significantly improve the learning result. In other words, it helps learners to study in "the best way." Copyright © 2014, IGI Global.},

MI has been used as a basis for the construction of modular enrichment activities to facilitate the development of human potential among boarding school students. This study examines (1) the effects of such activities on students of different multiple intelligence profiles and (2) the teachers' views of the MI based module and activities. Methodology-The study employs a quasi-experimental design with pre-and post-tests administered before and after treatment of the modular enrichment activities. Two groups of students from two Mara Junior Science Colleges (MRSM) in Malaysia participated in the study as the control and treatment groups. McKenzie's multiple intelligences instrument was used as the pre-and post-test measure. A semi-structured interview protocol was used to obtain teachers' views of the enrichment activities. Findings-The study found that the MI post-test was favourable towards the treatment group. Students in the treatment group improved on each multiple intelligence profile compared with students in the control group. The qualitative analysis of the interview data revealed favourable responses from the teachers towards the modular enrichment activities and the inclusion of MI. Significance-This study highlights the importance of recognising that each student has his/her distinct potential. These differences can be captured through the construction of various enrichment activities that emphasise on the different multiple intelligences. The modular learning experience simplifies the process of teaching and learning. It enables students and teachers to understand the objectives to be achieved through diverse problem solving and creative production activities. It is hoped that through this study, educators and teachers will gain ideas about ways in which a MI perspective can help them to tap student potential.},

	abstract = {This study relied on Sheorey and Mokhtari’s (2001) metacognitive knowledge about reading strategies,which was influenced by a number of factors, including previous experiences, beliefs, culture-specific instructional practices and proficiency in a second language (L2). This study is thereby built on the premise that EFL readers’ metacognitive awareness of reading strategies was also influenced by their multiple intelligence profiles. The purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impact of multiple intelligences and reading strategies on EFL learners’ reading performance. This was an explanatory sequential study, combining quantitative and qualitative research design. A convenience sample of 60 high school EFL learners from one of the Anatolian high schools in Istanbul, Turkey participated in this study. Two quantitative surveys and an achievement test, followed by a qualitative observation checklist, were used in this study to collect the data. The results of the study indicated that females were found to be more successful than males in EFL reading in addition to employing more support and problem solving reading strategies. In addition, this study also found that successful readers in EFL seemed to use more global strategies and tended to support reading strategies if they were dominant in musical, intrapersonal intelligences. Moreover, successful musically or verbally intelligent readers were found to use more problem-solving strategies. As a result, this study provides EFL teachers and curriculum designers with valuable information that will foster awareness of the role of these intelligence-strategy relations may play in triggering success in EFL reading, and thus, in their overall proficiency in the language. © 2015, Foundation for Education Science and Technology.

The Multiple Intelligences Inventory, developed by Saban (2001), was used to determine the students' multiple intelligences, and a personal information form was implemented to obtain socio-demographic data. The results of the study showed that [verbal-linguistic intelligence, mathematical-logical intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence] [intrapersonal intelligence, mathematical-logical intelligence, and verbal-linguistic intelligence] predicted 34% of the students' perfectionism levels (p < .001). The explanatory power of the scores in multiple intelligences over negative perfectionism was not found to be statistically significant for any of the sub-dimensions.

A survey was conducted with 701 parents of children between the ages of 6 and 12. Parents responded to closed-ended scales of mediation and genre-specific scenarios for television, as well as assessments of children’s aggression, prosocial behavior, academic achievement, and multiple intelligences. Television mediation scenarios revealed that there are significant weaknesses in the ability of Valkenburg’s television mediation scale to accurately capture parents’ mediation behaviors across television genres. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

In this study, 155 pairs of married couples from mainland China estimated their own, their partner’s and their only child’s overall intelligence and 13 “multiple intelligences.” They also completed a short measure of the Big Five personality traits. Replicating previous studies, fathers rated themselves higher than mothers for almost all types of intelligence. Results revealed, however, no parental sex differences in the estimates of children’s multiple intelligences. Both parents attributed higher overall, verbal, and musical intelligence, but lower existential intelligence to their child than to themselves. Multiple regressions indicated that estimates of verbal, logical–mathematical, spatial and intrapersonal intelligence were the best predictors of estimates of overall intelligence. Participants’ openness and neuroticism were significant predictors of self-rated intelligence. The results were interpreted in relation to specific Chinese social and cultural influences, though there seemed to be no “little emperor” effect. © 2014 European Council for High Ability.},

This component of the course illustrates one means by which teachers can not only integrate visual and performing arts in their classrooms, but also use common understandings and experiences to bridge cultural differences, to promote student learning and understanding in the arts and to integrate the performing and visual arts. The example that is examined in detail and that provides a model for further curriculum planning is an integrated, differentiated program planned on the matrix that results by combining the two typologies of Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Theory1 and The Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. The example provided focuses on the Monet painting In the Norwegian and is designed for implementation with 5- and 6-year-old students. Whilst the preservice teachers in this course have, on occasion, initially suggested that this particular art work may not be an obvious choice for an arts study with young students, on closer examination they were unanimous in their agreement that the subject matter crosses the boundaries of time, language and culture. It therefore could be considered to be a perfect vehicle through which to support the development of age appropriate skills, techniques and concepts as described in the prescribed syllabus documents. Importantly, this perspective of planning for teaching and learning in the performing and visual arts is nonprescriptive. It can be implemented in various ways in different classrooms by different teachers and with diverse groups of students without compromising any of its potential. © Common Ground, Authors, All Rights Reserved.},

In this paper, AHP is used to cluster a group of semester one students from Information & Communication Technology (ICT) Department to minimize intelligence gap and skills in each class. Pre-Test and Post-Test are used to evaluate students' performance and a questionnaire is distributed to the students before and after clustering process to evaluate student's motivational level. The research findings showed that students who were clustered with minimum intelligent gap and skills for their academic session shows a better performance and higher motivational level as compared to students in a cluster with multiple intelligent gap and skills.},

The participants were asked to tell a story based on images in children’s picture books. Twelve children, who participated in a screening session designed to identify young talented children for the Enrichment Program for Cultivating Problem Solving Abilities and Multiple Intelligences for Talented Preschoolers (PSMIGP program), were divided into a verbally talented group (VT) and a regular group (RE). The stories told by the participants were tape-recorded, transcribed, and coded using the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES). The results indicated that the verbally talented children demonstrated their linguistic talents at as young as four years of age. In telling a story, they used more clauses and more words that were different to complete the task. In addition, they used more modifiers (i.e. adjectives and adverbs) and employed more conjunctions that were more complex. However, there were no differences between the two groups in mean length of utterance (MLU) and type-token ratios (TTRs). This paper presents a discussion on the implications of this study and offers suggestions for future research. © The Author(s) 2014.},

	abstract = {Problem Statement: The present study is of importance for designing a differentiation approach, which enables gifted students to use their present potential in mathematics effectively and enables them to develop their achievement, while looking at the effect of the approach on both gifted and non-gifted students. Within the scope of the developed differentiation approach concerning mathematics education of gifted students, the present study is one of the limited studies with such a focus, which is why it is thought that it will contribute to the literature. By the results of the study, it is of great importance. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this research is to determine the effect of a newly-developed differentiation approach for the mathematics education of gifted middle school students on the achievements of both gifted and non-gifted students. Method: Within the scope of this current study, the model with pre-test and post-test control group among real research models in accordance with quantitative research method was used. The sample of the study was composed of 57 gifted and 60 non-gifted 5th and 6th grade students from a public school and a private school in Maltepe and Cekmekoy districts of Istanbul. Convenience and purposeful sampling were conducted within the scope of quantitative sampling in this study. ‘Mathematics Achievement Test’ and ‘Multiple-Intelligences Domains Inventory’ were used within the scope of this study. The lessons carried out using activities stated in the National Education curriculum about the related subjects were compared with lessons carried out with the activities designed according to the differentiation approach developed in three implementations conducted. Findings: The research made in private school showed that there is a significant difference between current-enriched and overall scores of gifted students in control and experimental groups after the application on behalf of the experimental group. The research made in the state school showed that there is a significant difference between current-enriched and overall scores of non-gifted students in control and experimental groups after the application on behalf of the experimental group. Conclusion and Recommendations: There was a significant increase in the achievement scores of experimental group students, where the activities designed according to differentiation approach developed within the scope of this study, when compared with the control group students during all of the implementations. This situation shows that activities and curriculum differentiation studies, which are based on elaboration, creative thinking, and multiple intelligences increase students’ academic achievements. Besides, it is seen that the changes based on creativity strategies on the content, process, product, and learning environments increase students’ academic achievements. The effectiveness of the developed differentiation approach should be researched with different grade levels, on different topics. It is suggested to use developed differentiation approach periodically for teachers and students to gain experience. It is further suggested to inform generally all teachers across the country about how they will guide the process of preparing projects and for teachers to inform their students about how they will prepare projects. © 2015, Ani Publishing.

The importance of this capability has driven defense research and acquisition investments toward creating a quiver of wide area imaging and radar sensors. Contributions from these systems to our post 9/11 conflicts have justified their expenses. However, they have arguably been employed using a limited set of concepts that has stifled their true operational utility. This deficiency has been masked in part by the mitigating effects of a vast proliferation of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems during the last decade of permissive wars. Conditions are changing though. Defense budgets are declining, and the global threat environment is trending toward even greater complexity within less favorable environments. Such is the impetus for this article, which seeks to offer an overarching framework for efficient, highly customized, multiple intelligence surveillance that will maximize the operational significance from our nation’s WAS investments. © 2015, U.S. Air Force, Air University.

The process of creating audiovisual products that we have developed in a school of the Community of Madrid, acquires a new dimension to work within the framework of the theory of multiple intelligences of Howard Gardner, and will allow us to observe how different intelligences are affected through the development and understanding of audiovisual works (Gardner, 2015). We will assess how the student, in addition to obtaining a better understanding of the media phenomenon and an acquisition of audiovisual and digital skills, benefits from the participation strategy and collaborative learning to improve certain skills related to several of the aforementioned author intelligences.},

	abstract = {The meteoric increase in technological advancement in the last few decades has dramatically transformed how people live their lives. Innovation is seen to be essential as it ensures sustainable growth in a knowledge-based economy and a competitive global marketplace. Consequently, enabling innovation to occur becomes of prime concern to educators and policymakers. Education for the twenty-first century is about developing multiple intelligences and this demands for a holistic education system committed to enabling a learner to achieve his/her maximum potential. The learning environment in the twenty-first century needs to encompass a multiplicity of places, ideas and people that is technologically driven and often, a virtual rather than a physical space. The responsibility for creating such an environment lies in the teacher. This paper focuses on the role that teachers play in designing a powerful learning environment to drive twenty-first century learning and how teacher education must be re-designed to bring about possibilities of innovation. Possible design features of innovative teacher education programmes are outlined, including the need for a university-based teacher education programme, a strong emphasis on values and the changing role of teachers as mediators and designers of the learning environment. In order to nurture a future generation of strong thinkers, innovative problem-solvers and responsible and active local and global citizens, teachers need to consider teaching as a high calling. Finally, the paper emphasises the need for there to be strong partnerships and systemic coherence between key stakeholders of Education in order for the innovations to bring about transformation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The data were obtained through interview, observation and questioners. Meanwhile, the qualitative interactive data analysis was employed to analyze the collected data, it consisted of data collection, data reduction and verification. From the result of the research, it can be seen clearly that interpersonal intelligence strongly enhances student oral presentation proficiency. The result shows that the oral implementation of interpersonal intelligence in Seminar class helps students to prepare their presentation. Based on the result of the questionnaires, it can be seen that 80 % of the respondents state strongly agree that building good relationship among classmates foster their ability to speak both formal and informal speech. This was supported by the result of the observation that more than 85% students have good relationship to their friends, they always communicate better especially in preparing any works to be presented. Meanwhile, based on the interview to the respondent, it can be seen that they need to increase their communication to their friends to enhance their way of communication.},

	abstract = {PurposeA review of current initiatives to increase science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) achievement among American youth and young adults reveals the presence of “IQism”. That is, whether such interventions are directed toward low-income minorities and/or the disproportionate number of higher-income youth who have selected liberal arts majors over an STEM major, the country has reserved STEM as a field for “the best and the brightest”. Utilizing the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, this article argues that STEM content is accessible to all students including those whose first language is informal rather than formal English. Based upon these premises, this conceptual paper aims to introduce the framework of Teaching STEM as a Second Language as a strategy for elevating STEM achievement among students who would otherwise be excluded from the STEM movement. Design/methodology/approachThis paper utilizes a review of both classic and current literature on second language acquisition to identify strategies that can be adopted by STEM instructors to increase STEM achievement among youth and young adults who are viewed as “average” and/or “below-average” academic performers. FindingsUsing quotes that confirm the thesis that STEM subject matter has been historically viewed as the domain of those whose cognitive skills place them among the “best and the brightest”, the second language acquisition (SLA) strategy of “scaffolding” is introduced as a pedagogy for producing “comprehensible output” when STEM content is taught to students whose first language is informal English. Constructivism, a concept currently used to guide the teaching of STEM contents is introduced as a framework that merges best practices in STEM and SLA. Using Cummins’ (1991) Common Underlying Proficiency Model, other strategies are also proposed for exporting SLA pedagogies and approaches to elevate equity in the quest to improve STEM achievement levels among youth and adults in the USA. Originality/valueSLA theories and concepts have not been applied as a potential tool for teaching STEM. This is a unique and powerful lens that can be used to more effectively support the needs of underrepresented populations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

While academic researchers have discussed the status of emotional competence compared to the traditional intelligence, it is very important to elucidate how laypersons regard emotional competence compared to traditional intelligence as well. The present study investigated the position of emotional competence in the multiple intelligences theory by assessing laypersons' self-estimates of their abilities and their rating of the importance of emotional competence for thriving in society. Participants (N = 584) answered a questionnaire online. Results showed that laypersons regarded emotional competence as a distinct construct, and most strongly related it to personal intelligence. Moreover, their ratings of the importance of emotional competence and personal intelligence for thriving in society were higher than that of traditional intelligence.},

For this purpose, advantage was taken on the information previously collected through a questionnaire about the views, thoughts and experiences of a group of teachers of childhood and primary education (N=25) who voluntarily participated in a blended training activity from Center of Teachers (CEFIRE) of Valencia, around a community of practice aimed at promoting and advising projects for implementing educational video games in the classroom. The mixed methodology adopted has allowed the following: a) describe the relationship between their degree of development and daily use made of ICT in the classroom, their level of familiarity with video games,  their previous experience to integrate them for educational purposes..., and their participation in projects that focus on game-based learning; b) conduct content analysis of the opinions and thoughts expressed in a forum for teachers on innovation on and methodological strategies adopted reflected in a virtual board; and c) develop a SWOT analysis: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats inherent in the implementation of experience with video games in the classroom. Among the conclusions, it is highlighted that, even though most did not have specific training or enough technological resources and the planning and implementation of innovation required them a great investment of time, their personal interest, the support given by members of the online community of practice, helped to encourage their activity, along with receptivity, positive attitude and high motivation of students with the experience. These aspects have been crucial to promote successful innovative practices with video games. © 2015, Universidad Complutense de Madrid. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Since 1983, when Howard Gardner published his theory of multiple intelligences, educators have begun to incorporate this new model into school programs. However, the idea of multimodal teaching is hardly a new concept. Many pioneers of modern education, such as: J. J. Rousseau, J.H. Pestalozzi, M. Montessory, J. Dewey, suggested educational models that oppose uniformity and predominantly verbal teaching. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to identify and compare compatible elements of educational ideas of John Dewey and Howard Gardner. The research is based on historical-comparative method and content analysis technique and is focused on exploring three key elements of intersection: curriculum, methods of teaching and learning, and teachers’ role. Regarding the curriculum, both authors prefer integrated and thematic curriculum based on real-life context. They also agree on student-centred teaching where implementation of variety of active methods of learning will give opportunity to students to express their specific identity. Teacher’s role in both concepts is to link students’ personal experiences and characteristics to the material being studied and to the school life in general. The findings imply that educational implications of Gardner’s theory can be considered as a continuation of Dewey’s progressive vision of classroom teaching and school organization. © 2016 IJCRSEE.

	abstract = {Since 1994, more and more students from other culture groups and languages have been attending traditionally Afrikaans speaking schools, which necessitated these schools not only to offer Afrikaans as a home language, but also as a second language. Learning a language, like any other learning activity, is influenced by several factors. Bloom (1976:11) distinguishes in his learning model (this is also the model that will be used in this investigation) between three groups of variables which relate to learning and achievement, namely cognitive variables, affective variables and the quality of instruction. It is, however, difficult to investigate quality of instruction, since different teachers instruct a second language. Consequently, it was decided in the current investigation to focus on the manner in which the learners teach themselves, or stated differently, the learning style they follow.With regard to cognitive variables high school learners find themselves, according to Piaget's theory, in a transition phase between the concrete operational and formal operational stage. However, students' thinking abilities do not develop in the same way and the transition to the formal operational stage does not occur at exactly the same age (Ojose 2008:26-30). This has important implications for achievement in a language. The importance of cognitive factors with regard to the acquisition of a second language has been examined by international researchers (Dekeyser 2000 499-533; Robinson 2005:235-268). Wetzels, Kester, Van Merriënboer and Brothers (2011:274-291) as well as Krekeler (2006:99-130) have shown a relationship between prior knowledge and achievement in a second language. Research done more recently in a South African context deals with aspects such as multiple intelligence (Van den Berg 2004:279-294), the value of reading activities (Van Wyk 2005:113-115), language transfer (Stander 2001:107-122), figurative language (van der Merwe 2008:45-64) and assessment tasks (Van den Berg 2004:279-294). Affective variables such as self-concept, motivation and anxiety are often associated with language performance (Ni 2012:1509). The investigations of Gose, Wooden and Muller (2001:279- 287) as well as Kaniuka (2010:184-188) have shown that self-concept correlates positively with language performance while Engin (2009:1035-1042) and Shirbagi (2010:1-14) highlighted the importance of motivation. Awan, Azher, Anwar and Naz (2010:33-40) showed that Pakistan students learning English as a second language experience anxiety. Pappamihiel (2002:327-356) obtained similar results for Mexican students. As far as learning style is concerned Peacock (2001:5-20) investigated Chinese students who learned English as a second language. It was found that all learners had a particular learning style, that teachers' preferred learning styles do not necessarily correspond with the style that learners prefer, different learning styles can be attained and that performance in a second language (in this case English) improved as a result of a combination of learning styles. Research on international level cannot simply be made applicable to black learners studying Afrikaans. Black learners are not taught in their native language, but in English, which is already their second language. Strictly speaking, Afrikaans for the majority of black learners, is in fact not a second language, but a third language. Another problem is that previous investigations do not simultaneously include cognitive and affective variables, nor quality of instruction or learning style. It is therefore difficult to determine which of these variables may be considered important in order to explain the variance in the performance of Afrikaans as a second language. The aims of the current investigation study were firstly to determine how achievement in Afrikaans relates to achievement in English which is the medium of instruction for most black learners. The second aim was to determine which cognitive factors relate to achievement in Afrikaans and thirdly which affective factors relate to achievement in Afrikaans. The fourth aim was to compare the achievement in Afrikaans of learners with different learning styles, and the fifth aim was to determine which of the variables mentioned above can be considered the most important in explaining the variance in the achievement of Afrikaans as a second language. An empirical investigation was carried out with a sample of 174 learners in grades 8, 9, 10 and 11 (54 boys and 120 girls). A correlation coefficient of r=0.60; p<0.01 was obtained between Afrikaans as a second language and English as the medium of instruction, indicating a significant positive correlation. Significant positive correlations were also obtained between the cognitive variables (development of thought, verbal comprehension and memory) and achievement in Afrikaans. The highest correlation was between verbal comprehension and achievement in Afrikaans (r=0.34; p<0.01). Significant positive correlations were obtained between the self-concept of learners and their achievement in Afrikaans (r=0,52; p<0.01) and between the motivation of learners and theirachievement in Afrikaans (r=0,37; p<0.01). A significant negative correlation was obtained between the anxiety of learners and their achievement in Afrikaans (r=-0,37; p<0.01). No significant difference in the average Afrikaans performance of the learners with different learning styles could be shown. Self-concept, memory, verbal comprehension and motivation were identified as the most important variables. These variables explained 39% of the variance in the achievement of Afrikaans. From the results, two specific recommendations are made: Firstly, verbal comprehension emerged as a major cognitive variable which underlines the importance of reading. Secondly, teachers should be aware that affective factors, with particular reference to the self-concept of learners, fulfil an important role in the class where a second language is taught.},

In order to update the evaluation index system of physical education teaching in colleges and universities, the thesis, based on the multiple intelligence theory, constructs an evaluation index system of physical education from all-round aspects, i.e., teaching step, teaching and learning step as well as managing step. Furthermore, according to the weight of various evaluation indexes on the foundation of AHP method, plus with the involvement of fuzzy evaluation information, the thesis puts forward with a comprehensive fuzzy evaluation model of physical education teaching in colleges and universities. This model serves as an attempt to effectively evaluate physical education teaching, the validity of which is proved in the case analysis part. Copyright © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.},

Gender differences regarding the use of speaking strategies were also examined in this research. Participants in this study were three hundred and sixty undergraduate EFL learners from several universities in Iran who were presented with a questionnaire including McKenzie’s Multiple Intelligences Inventory and Oral Communication Strategy Inventory (OCSI). Results of data analysis revealed that there is a significant relationship between EFL learners’ musical and visual intelligences and their use of speaking strategies. Results of more analysis indicated significant relationship between musical intelligence and accuracy-oriented and fluency-oriented strategies, and visual intelligence and social affective and negotiation for meaning strategies.

This paper sets out two aims, first to investigate the structural representation of the self perceived multiple intelligences for this set of children and second to discuss how the best fit model might reflect children’s culture and their school experiences. After carrying out exploratory factor analysis, a four factor first order model was shown to have a good fit. A higher order factor solution was investigated owing to the correlation of two latent constructs. In order to provide some insight into the multiple intelligences construct the relationship between the SMIP items, student test outcomes and attitudes to learning were examined.

	abstract = {Background. Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory (MI) is one of the leading psychological theories taught in teacher training, yet little research has explored how it can be applied to martial arts. Public school teachers of all subjects, including Physical Education, have successfully incorporated MI into their classrooms, so there can be little doubt as to its potential for success in Taekwondo. Problem. Successful learning of Taekwondo is not only be measured in how quickly and well students acquire the art's skills but in their ability to adhere to the art's philosophies as well. To ensure Taekwondo practice is more than just beneficial to one's physical health, instructors should make their lessons applicable to students' daily lives. Methods. This paper examines how MI can be applied to Taekwondo's philosophy of self-cultivation. Three sample plans are provided to illustrate how instructors can teach Taekwondo physical skills and philosophy simultaneously. Results. All teachers can maximize their students' acquisition of knowledge or skills by incorporating MI into their lesson plans. MI is an effective means for teaching Taekwondo and its philosophy of self-cultivation, because it can aid in creating dynamic and personalized learning experiences. The results of this study indicate MI can facilitate the instruction of Taekwondo philosophy. Conclusions. Taekwondo instructors can become more effective in disseminating their art's self-cultivation philosophy by identifying students' specific intelligences to provide personal guidance. Instructors need to communicate in a way that best benefits the learner. It is evident that failing to focus on the self-cultivation ideologies of Taekwondo philosophy could lead students to believe that the art was solely for destructive purposes. Instructors only need to give students a quick incentive to explore Taekwondo's self-cultivation philosophy for themselves. © Idokan Poland Association.},

In looking for ways to better adapt and promote public relations to the service of fully functioning society, it revisits controversies around the notion of multiple intelligences (MIs), including emotional intelligence. It examines the stakes and status involved in claiming "ownership" of IQ or of promoting another "form" of intelligence(s). In addition, the article foregrounds the formative role played by promotional communication, especially in framing ideas and telling stories, to gain traction in academic communities and to gain acceptance among wider publics. Finally, it suggests that public relations is a disciple of strategic intelligence that could learn by adapting to, or adopting from, the growing range of subjects aspiring to be the next big intelligence. We suggest that such an adaptation has benefits: it might to better access knowledge with contemporary and future relevance rather than slowly consolidating a more insular Public Relations Body of Knowledge based on past results; it can improve the field's impact and reputation by engaging public relations with cross-disciplinary controversies; and it can follow Gardner's (2008) forward-looking view of the need for any discipline, or cluster of good intelligences, to be oriented to serving a global community. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

A statistically significant difference was observed between the mothers’ educational levels and their democratic and authoritarian attitude scores. Again, it was also observed that there was a statistically significant difference between the fathers’ educational levels and the authoritarian mother and the permissive mother attitude scores. As the father’s education level decreases, the mother’s attitude becomes authoritarian. Moreover, the mothers’ and the fathers’ educational levels did not make a difference between the children’s verballinguistic, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, musical-rhythmic, bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal and social scores. © Kamla-Raj 2016.},

	abstract = {Background: The teaching and learning of clinical skills is a key component of nurse education programmes. The clinical competency of pre-registration nursing students has raised questions about the proficiency of teaching strategies for clinical skill acquisition within pre-registration education. Objectives: This study aimed to test the effectiveness of teaching clinical skills using a multiple intelligences teaching approach (MITA) compared with the conventional teaching approach. Design: A randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (MITA intervention) (n. =. 46) and a control group (conventional teaching) (n. =. 44) to learn clinical skills. Setting: Setting was in one Irish third-level educational institution. Participants: Participants were all first year nursing students (n. =. 90) in one institution. Methods: The experimental group was taught using MITA delivered by the researcher while the control group was taught by a team of six experienced lecturers. Participant preference for learning was measured by the Index of Learning Styles (ILS). Participants' multiple intelligence (MI) preferences were measured with a multiple intelligences development assessment scale (MIDAS). All participants were assessed using the same objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) at the end of semester one and semester two. MI assessment preferences were measured by a multiple intelligences assessment preferences questionnaire. The MITA intervention was evaluated using a questionnaire. Results: The strongest preference on ILS for both groups was the sensing style. The highest MI was interpersonal intelligence. Participants in the experimental group had higher scores in all three OSCEs (p. <. 0.05) at Time 1, suggesting that MITA had a positive effect on clinical skill acquisition. Most participants favoured practical examinations, followed by multiple choice questions as methods of assessment. MITA was evaluated positively. Conclusion: The study findings support the use of MITA for clinical skills teaching and advance the understanding of how MI teaching approaches may be used in nursing education. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Our research focused on studying the extent to which the planned, systematic use of educational videogames can result in the generation of learning contexts conducive to developing Multiple Intelligences (MIs) amongst schoolchildren. Methodology. A twofold methodological approach was adopted: a) qualitative: previous assessment and analysis of the videogame to be utilized in the experience, giving priority to its suitability and correspondence with primary education curricular areas; b) experimental: case study oriented to verifying the possible increase of MIs amongst pupils enrolled in the First Cycle of Primary Education (N=101) derived from implementing the videogame in the classroom during one academic year, using a control group and identifying the level reached before (test) and after the experience (post-test) with an assessment instrument. Results. The previous selection of a videogame guarantees the acquisition and reinforcement of numerous learning formats linked to specific Primary Education curricular contents. The fun activities –related to all eight intelligences– imply motivating challenges for schoolchildren as well as chances to boost various skills. A widespread increase of all intelligences was observed after the playful-formative experience with the videogame; this became particularly significant in the cases of logical-mathematical, visual-spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence –the first two improving to a greater extent in girls than in boys. Conclusions: The starting hypothesis was verified: the introduction of suitable videogames in the classroom and their systematic exploitation promotes MI development amongst primary education children. In particular, measuring operations, mathematical calculations, counts, shape and size identification and classification, relationships and correspondences, etc., presented in an entertaining way by means of animations, graphics and drawings, together with the activities that promote body care (healthy diet and personal hygiene), facilitate learning and improve MIs. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental},

Using non-probabilistic judgment sampling, 3 focus groups made up by high school students were formed: 2 composed of mobilized students (11 and 12 students) and one comprising 15 students without participation in the demonstrations. Through a constructivist approach, content analysis was performed, defining shared and non-shared thematic areas. According to the results, the central core in students consists of the following shared thematic areas: multiple intelligence, innate intelligence and its development, social and emotional intelligence, and differences in opportunities for the development of intelligence. In the peripheral system divergences are present in 3 thematic areas: the ideology of "meritocracy", holistic intelligence, and the hegemonic ideology of intelligence. These results are discussed in terms of a structural approach to social representations of intelligence. © 2014 by Psykhe.},

	abstract = {Intelligence is a dynamic ever growing reality than can be expanded in one's life through eight intelligences given by Gardner (1999) theory of Multiple Intelligences. Two of the most important intelligences i. e. Interpersonal Intelligence and Intrapersonal Intelligence are influenced by socio-cultural factors. Early adolescence is very crucial period of life, it is the time when social, emotional or educational development is at the peak during this phase. So, this is the time when people should recognize their strong interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences to pursue interest and choose future professions. A person can be most successful in a profession when the profession is according to his/her abilities and interests. So, this is the time society should recognize their strong interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences and factors which influence these two intelligences. Keeping in mind this importance, a study was conducted among 160 students of 12-14 years old in rural and urban areas of Hisar and Sirsa districts to assess the type and existing level of intelligence along with factors affecting interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences. Interpersonal intelligence was found significantly associated with gender of the child and area of the child in which he or she is going, whereas satisfaction of the queries by teachers was observed significantly associated with both the intelligences i. e. interpersonal as well as intrapersonal intelligences. Non-significant results were found between intrapersonal intelligence and area of the child. The study suggested measures to promote interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence approaches in the state in the changing scenario.},

	abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to apply the Developmental Model of Vocational Excellence (DMVE) in the domain of air traffic control and to describe the characteristics and predictors related to air traffic controllers’ (ATCO) vocational expertise and excellence. Based on DMVE, the study analyses the role of natural abilities (gifts), intrinsic characteristics (self-regulatory abilities) and extrinsic conditions (domain and non-domain specific factors) in ATCOs’ vocational development. Design/methodology/approach-The target population of the multiple case study consisted of ATCOs in Finland (N_300), of which 28 were interviewed. The interviewees represented four different airports. Initially, three key personnel interviews were conducted to validate the structured theme interview instrument that was subsequently used for the 28 interviews. The data set also included the ATCOs’ aptitude test scores and training records. Employee assessments were used to determine their on-the-job performance level (expertise vs excellence). The research questions were examined using theoretical concept analysis. The qualitative data analysis was conducted with content analysis and Bayesian classification modelling. Findings-The findings indicate that cognitive skills, self-reflection, volition and goal-orientation are considered to be ATCOs’ most important vocational characteristics in addition to interpersonal, intrapersonal and spatial skills. The main differences between the ATCOs representing vocational expertise and those representing vocational excellence were related to self-regulation; motivation and volition in particular proved to be somewhat stronger in the latter group. Research limitations/implications-It was acknowledged that there are limitations in the present study. First, the four airports were not selected randomly. Although they represent different types of airports (andATCOjob profiles) in Finland quite well, future studies should include comparative aspect to airports in other countries. Second, the number of participants (N_28) in the study was quite small, limiting generalization of the results to the target population (N_300). Future research on this domain should be extended to include also quantitative measurements, allowing more generalizable results. Third, although the analysis for the research question 3 was based on a technique that is not sensitive to missing values (BCM), missing data in ATCOs’ aptitude test scores, training records and employee assessments added uncertainty to the results. Practical implications-ATCOs’ highly controlled and pre-defined work presents a challenge to work motivation, which is seen as one of the determining factors in safety in air traffic controlling (ATC). In the future, more emphasis should be placed on the prerequisites of professional development such as leadership (human resource management, feedback, employees’ opportunity to influence), working environment (physical and social environment), educational possibilities and career progression, as well as professional benefits (salary and working hours). Originality/value-Although ATC is a fairly studied topic since 1970s, most studies related to ATCOs have concentrated on training, learning on the job, cognitive capacity and processing and stress tolerance. This study extends the emerging research in the field on self-regulation by adopting DMVE to investigate its role, alongside natural abilities and domain and non-domain specific factors, to vocational talent development in different skill acquisition stages. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This article reports on a study that explored the role of manipulatives in the teaching and learning of trigonometric ratios in grade 10. The approach attempts in addressing three domains of the Multiple Intelligence Theory (linguistic/verbal intelligence, logical/mathematical intelligence and spatial intelligence). The foundation of this research was a case study contained in the interpretative paradigm involving five grade 10 mathematics pupils at a high school in South Africa. The data was collected from: (1) activity sheet containing written responses of pupils; (2) observations; and (3) semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed and it was found that the use of manipulatives in teaching and learning mathematics played a positive role in leaners understanding of trigonometric ratios at grade 10 level. In general the findings of this study supported other research findings that confirm that manipulatives were important mediating tools in the development of conceptual and procedural understanding of mathematical concepts. Besides these pedagogical implications the study proved that the manipulatives effectively consolidated the features of Lesh's model. © 2015 University of South Africa.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the relevance of Howard Gardner's concept of "Five minds for the future" to the field of public relations, both for practitioners and educators. It extends Gardner's concept by adding a futures dimension to generate what I term "futures intelligence" that I argue is now necessary for the sustainability of the public relations field itself as well as of its clients. Futures intelligence is forward thinking, strategic, positive and empathetic. With its emphasis on future possibilities, futures intelligence not only provides practical ability to use the tools by which practitioners can plan and adapt for the long term but does this by taking into account societies' collective needs rather than those of self-serving individuals. The paper illustrates a process of building futures intelligence with a description of innovative teaching to post graduate public relations students at a university in New Zealand. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Looking at learning procedure in general and language learning in particular, variations abound in learning processes and styles. Along this journey, some learners travel/move ahead smoothly and some others are faced with challenges of different sorts. Among the significant factors contributing to more effective and efficient language learning output, motivation, attitude, and personality traits play major roles. However, the role played by the intelligence seems to be critical in any language learning tasks and activities. Emotional Intelligence, which is believed to harmonize cognitive and emotional dispositions, seems to be indispensable to the interrelation between the learner’s Multiple Intelligence makeup and respective preferred learning strategies. This can be used to develop materials and teaching tasks to become more or less compatible with the learners’ varying preferences and abilities, thereby promoting their achievements. The findings of the study pertaining to the interrelation of students’ Multiple Intelligence profile and their preferred Language Learning Strategies can be used to plan and categorize language learning and teaching tasks and materials in order to modify them more in accordance with the choice of the students. The educators might use the findings to choose from among various teaching materials to satisfy the needs of their learners with different illiteracies through conducting need analysis prior to choosing any learning and teaching content materials. © Australian International Academic Centre, Australia.},

An analysis of two periods in our training practice, in which we used the blending of different strategies, draws useful conclusions for the purpose of achieving higher commitment and motivation from students.

Multiple intelligences and L2 reading measurements of participants – 29 males and 69 females who were selected from four intact classes – were obtained through McKenzie’s (1999) Multiple Intelligences Inventory and reading part of a Preliminary English Test PET, respectively, and then Pearson’s correlation analysis was run to determine the degree of the relationship between each component of multiple intelligences and L2 reading skill. Afterwards, through a multiple regression analysis those components of multiple intelligences which acted as the predictors of L2 reading skill were identified and the power of each predictor was calculated. The results of the correlation analyses revealed that linguistic-verbal, logical-mathematical, spatial, and interpersonal intelligences were significantly correlated with reading skill. In addition, the results showed that linguistic-verbal, interpersonal, and logical-mathematical intelligences were the best predictors of L2 reading skill scores of the participants.

The design of the agents follows 5W principles and seeks to encourage learners to expend mental effort upon multi-faceted learning and self-reflection. Using semantic networks, we developed dialogue lines for reflection-prompting agents. We analyzed the participants' answers using natural language processing technology to classify the sentences into positive and negative rankings. A preliminary field study with 117 high school students was conducted over three weeks to test the effects of agent-prompted self-reflection. The results demonstrated that 96% and 62% of participants separately completed the first and the second simulation activities (including the agent-prompted self-reflections respectively). Those who did not finish the activities were generally limited by time restrictions rather than a lack of motivation, as the participants typically considered the interactions with the agents to be interesting. The self-reflections elicited through the agent interviews were consistent with the reflections obtained from paper-pencil questionnaires and appeared to be stable over time. Future study, including investigations using a randomized experimental design with a control group, is needed to fully assess the effects of agent-prompted self-reflection. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

Spatial intelligence, as one domain of the multiple structures of intelligence, which is thought to play a great role in reading, writing, and literacy, particularly in L2 learning, has not received sufficient attention as it deserves. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the relationship between EFL learners' spatial intelligence and their performance on cloze tests in general; (2) to determine which variety of cloze tests, analytic or perceptual (based on deletion method), may correlate more strongly with learners' spatial intelligence. Accordingly, a correlational study was conducted with 41 male Iranian EFL learners at Jihad Daneshgahi Language Center of Tehran University (Iran). Participants' scores on the spatial intelligence test were first compared with their scores on two cloze tests. Next, the obtained correlations were examined to see the effect of deletion method for cloze tests on the strength of the relationship between the spatial intelligence scores and scores on the cloze tests. Significant correlations (0.61 and 0.56) were found between the variables. The findings emphasize making reconsiderations in using cloze tests in EFL contexts. Further research is also suggested to explore spatial intelligence and its role in language classrooms.},

To find out the relationships among the naturally occurring variables, the researcher employed a descriptive and ex post facto design. The participants were 128 randomly selected pre-university students. The researcher utilized three instruments, namely: 1) a demographic questionnaire; 2) the Persian version of Mckenzie's MI Inventory; and 3) a standardized reading proficiency test retrieved from paper-based TOEFL® tests. Analyzing the data using t-test, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference in the mean of musical-rhythmic intelligence scores of the low achievers and the high achievers which was positive and stronger among the low achievers. Accordingly, it seems that the high achievers may have lower musical intelligence, which also indicates that better readers may be less intelligent 'musically'. A statistically significant difference was also found between the mean bodily-kinesthetic intelligence scores of the two genders which was positive and stronger among the females.

The purpose of this paper is to share initial findings on assessment of systems thinking competency. Design/methodology/approach: The 15-week course served 14 mostly third and fourth-year students. Assessment of learning arose through one short answer exam, one interactive small group dialogue exam, homework assignments, completion of an online community engagement tutorial, and completion of a final reflective project (either in a group or individual). Findings: The range of assessments enabled the authors to provide "frequent and ongoing feedback," "a long time horizon for learning," and "stable communities of practice." Students had multiple opportunities to demonstrate their learning progress in a variety of forms and contexts across multiple intelligences. Research limitations/implications: Despite attempts to actively promote the kind of frequent and authentic assessment advocated in the literature, the authors' results suggest the need for a consistent and valid assessment measure with an agreed upon rubric and stable assessment across multiple reviewers. Practical implications: The authors recommend that the proper activities and rubrics exist to match a program's competencies before implementing the approach. Social implications: The examples described in the paper provide some concrete assignments and approaches linked to the pedagogy of teaching and learning amenable to many other educational institutions in support of the UN Education for Sustainable Development effort. Originality/value: The authors' approach provides a unique attempt at implementing and assessing a competency-based approach to implementing the learning paradigm to foster sustainability systems thinking. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Olin College of Engineering was founded on the philosophy that a hands-on, entrepreneurial, design-centered engineering education would create engineers ready to solve current and emerging problems. This paper aims to discuss the philosophy and development of Olin College and the Olin College Library, and then to address its evolving materials collection. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the development of Olin College, its philosophy and discusses its evolving materials samples collection. Findings: Olin's library has embraced the college's philosophy through the development of a realia, or learning objects collection that supports multiple intelligences. Moving beyond these learning objects, library staff wanted to build a collection of materials samples that enhance the engineering curriculum, and specifically design, sustainability and materials science courses. Students use the objects to make project decisions and for inspiration. The hands-on nature of the collection aligns with the pedagogical philosophy of the college. These objects are physically available and also are beginning to have digital representation. A growing partnership between the library and specific courses is helping build the collection, while subscriptions from vendors assure a steady growth of new objects. Practical implications: The collection requires three phases of thought and development beyond acquisitions: display of objects, storage of objects, and the digital representation of objects. The digital representation has several layers of development, from database building to metadata decisions to object photos to the workflow and policy decisions.

To this end, a 90-item multiple intelligence questionnaire and a 23-item listening strategy questionnaire were distributed among 120 Iranian male and female EFL learners from the universities of Sistan and Baluchestan, Iranshahr, and Yasuj. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation), and inferential statistics (correlation and independent t-test) were used to analyze the data. The data analyses demonstrated that the most and the least dominant types of multiple intelligences among participants of this study were existential and naturalistic intelligences and those of listening strategies were cognitive and socio-affective strategies, respectively. The results also revealed that there was some significant positive relationship between the overall MIs and listening strategies. In a similar vein, the findings indicated that there are significant differences between male and female students in bodily, interpersonal, and existential intelligence, but the analysis showed no significant difference between male and female students regarding their listening strategies.},

Part of it is the use of various teaching approaches in classroom instruction as an effort to help the students comprehend the curriculum content better. One of the major teaching approaches which is widely used in Malaysian secondary schools is Multiple Intelligences Teaching Approach or collectively known as MITA. Hence, a qualitative research was conducted to look at teachers' instructional practices in employing multiple intelligences in classroom instruction. Research subjects were six English teachers who serve as informants. Data were collected from classroom observations, semi-structured in-depth interviews and document analysis. Classroom observations were conducted to record the actual classroom instruction that took place in English reading comprehension classrooms while semi-structured in-depth interviews were administered to obtain precise information from the informants. Raw data were recorded and transcribed manually. Later, the data were analysed interpretively and descriptively based on the themes that emerged from research findings. Meanwhile, triangulating data was done to ascertain the validity and reliability of the findings. The study unveiled the application of multiple intelligences teaching approach in classroom instruction at some secondary schools in Pahang based on the POMAT model. Important aspects being explored included the application of multiple intelligences in instructional procedure, instructional objective, instructional material, classroom assessment and instructional technology. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

It was one of a programmatic series of studies done in over 30 countries that has demonstrated the female "humility" and male "hubris" effect in self-estimated and other-estimated intelligence. Two hundred and thirty Russian university students estimated their own and their parents' overall intelligence and "multiple intelligences." Results revealed no sex difference in estimates of overall intelligence for both self and parents, but men rated themselves higher on spatial intelligence. This contradicted many previous findings in the area which have shown that men rate their own overall intelligence and mathematical intelligence significantly higher than do women. Regressions indicated that estimates of verbal, logical, and spatial intelligences were the best predictors of estimates of overall intelligence, which is a consistent finding over many studies. Regressions also showed that participants' openness to experience and self-respect were good predictors of intelligence estimates. A comparison with a British sample showed that Russians gave higher mother estimates, and were less likely to believe that IQ tests measure intelligence. Results were discussed in relation to the influence of gender role stereotypes on lay conception of intelligence across cultures. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper is the first to explore the relationship between these two intelligence types and EFL undergraduates’ use of LCs in both their L1 (Arabic) and L2 (English). Two instruments (the Multiple Intelligence Inventory and the Logical Relations Reading Test) were administered to 200 English-major undergraduates. The results revealed that these students had significantly higher logical/mathematical intelligence than linguistic intelligence. Nonetheless, linguistic intelligence had a stronger correlation with their reading comprehension performance in both their L1 and L2. The findings of this study and their implications are helpful for EFL instructors and invite further in-depth research that addresses the relationship between intelligence types and EFL learning. © 2014, Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

The other objectives were to identify the components of MI which are correlated with the reading test scores, and to determine the relationship between the multiple intelligences and reading proficiency. A descriptive and ex post facto design was employed to ascertain relationships among the variables. The participants were 128 randomly chosen pre-university students (grade12, 18-19 years old) of both genders studying in Tehran in the academic year 2008-2009. Three instruments were utilized in this study: 1) a demographic questionnaire; 2) the Persian version of Mckenzie's MI Inventory; and 3) a standardized reading proficiency test which was selected from retrieved paper-based TOEFL® tests. Results of the correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between the two variables of MI and reading scores of the students. Furthermore, the results of the correlation analysis revealed that there was a low significant, negative relationship between musical-rhythmic intelligence and reading which suggests that when the reading score of a student increases, musical-rhythmic intelligence of the same student decreases and vice versa. Overall, three categories of MI (musical-rhythmic, verbal-linguistic, bodily-kinesthetic) were found to be predictive of reading proficiency.},

The first phase of L2A is mainly dedicated to listening to the students via the submission of an on-line questionnaire that measures their learning preferences, self-efficacy and sensitivity to the themes of sustainability and the green economy. The investigation has been extended from Italy to Honduras, where the authors are involved in the development of major projects concerning sustainability. The results of the survey have been analyzed by means of standard significance and correlation analysis, and therefore, significant differences among the groups and correlations within each group have been detected.

Or is language acquisition just another problem to be solved by general intelligence, in this case, the problem of how to communicate with other humans over the auditory channel?

Serious games, as they are called, are defined as games that have a primary purpose other than entertainment. However, it is challenging to create games that both educate and entertain. While game designers have embraced some psychological concepts such as flow and mastery, understanding how these concepts work together within established psychological theory would assist them in creating effective serious games. Similarly, game design professionals have understood the propensity of video games to teach while lamenting that educators do not understand how to incorporate educational principles into game play in a way that preserves the entertainment. Bandura (2006) social cognitive theory (SCT) has been used successfully to create video games that create positive behavior outcomes, and teachers have successfully used Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences (MIs) to create engaging, immersive learning experiences. Cognitive behavioral game design is a new framework that incorporates SCT and MI with game design principles to create a game design blueprint for serious games. © 2014 Starks.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the possible relationship between Gardner's [1] eight intelligence types and listening comprehension of 75 (39 females and 36 males) intermediate EFL learners. Inherent in this investigation was the assumption that not all the eight gates of intelligence predict success in the target language listening tasks to the same strength because this relationship may vary depending on the context where it is investigated. To measure the participants' multiple intelligences and listening proficiency, a highly reliable MI-based questionnaire developed by Armstrong [2] and a TOEFL Listening test were applied. Using the enter method, a significant model emerged from the data submitted to a series of multiple regression analyses. In addition, of the eight intelligences, visual and interpersonal intelligences showed a strongly positive relationship with the listening test scores of both males and females. It was concluded that intelligences-based EFL instruction grants opportunities to discover, value and enhance the talents of EFL learners in better tackling language learning. However, it should be highlighted that context plays a significant role in shaping the learners' intelligence. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.},

This MIT-oriented study investigated the role of successful L2 readers' multiple intelligences in their effective use of reading strategies. To this end, a TOEFL reading comprehension test was administered to a cohort of 135 English as a foreign language students at several universities in the southwest and centre of Iran, and 80 students were identified as successful L2 readers based on the ETS rating scale and their TOEFL scores. Then, they answered an MI questionnaire originally developed by Armstrong and a reading strategies inventory adapted by Singhal. The data were quantitatively analysed using correlations and multiple regressions. The results revealed that linguistic, logical-mathematical and intrapersonal intelligences were the good L2 readers' most dominant intelligences, while bodily intelligence was the least common type. In addition, they mostly employed metacognitive and cognitive strategies but rarely drew upon affective and compensation strategies while reading. Further, there was a significant positive relationship between linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligences and the use of metacognitive and cognitive reading strategies. Similar relationships were also found between linguistic intelligence and the participants' use of memory strategy, on one hand, and between interpersonal intelligence and compensation and social strategy use, on the other. Importantly, linguistic and intrapersonal intelligences as well as metacognitive and cognitive strategy use were shown to be the best predictors of reading comprehension. Finally, the theoretical or pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

This paper looks at how the use of Active Learning in an undergraduate setting enabled the development and implementation of a leadership subject for nursing students preparing for professional practice. Through the use of a specific model of Active Learning, incorporating multiple intelligences into education allows students to bring deeper learning to their conscience so that whole person learning is an engaged experience.

Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to investigate the students' MI profiles. The results of this study showed that all intelligences were possessed by the students either in strong, moderate, or weak category. Existential intelligence became the strongest intelligence among the nine types of multiple intelligences. Moreover, other types of multiple intelligences in strong category were interpersonal intelligence and verbal-linguistic intelligence. They were the second and the third intelligence of the strongest intelligences. The other types were in moderate category, were intrapersonal intelligence, musical intelligence, visual-spatial intelligence, logical mathematic intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and naturalist intelligence. In terms of gender, the study revealed, male students significantly possessed stronger in logical-mathematic intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence, Meanwhile, Female students were significantly stronger in musical intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, and existential intelligence.

Whilst verbal, naturalistic and intra-personal intelligences were seen to be relatively easy to change, creative and musical intelligences were seen as much less so. The 14 "intelligences" factored into three interpretable factors labelled as abstract, skilful and classical intelligences. Core self-evaluation and growth mindset were both highly significant correlates of each factor. Whilst neuroticism and openness were significant correlates for abstract and classical intelligences respectively, no other significant results were obtained from the Big Five personality traits.

The theory of Multiple Intelligences, as it was presented by Howard Gardner, tries to prove that human beings are characterized by several types of intelligences, with a few of them clearly dominating. In this way, earlier theories describing the construct in question appear to be invalid, at least to some extent. The IQ tests, which measure only a few separate abilities, cannot represent the whole construct of intelligence. The teaching styles chosen for the study were established on the basis of earlier descriptions by different authors. For the purpose of this research three teaching styles were compiled: the counseling style, the authoritarian style and the affective style. By means of observations, a questionnaire and Multiple Intelligences Inventory, the existing relationship was revealed to show that all teachers were characterized by linguistic intelligence and other personal intelligences varied depending on their teaching style. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

	abstract = {Established scholarship in arts education is invariably related to theories of development founded on notions of multiple intelligence and experiential learning. Yet when contemporary arts practice is retraced on a philosophical horizon, one begins to engage with other cases for learning. This state of affairs reveals art's inherent paradox where the expectation of learning is substituted by forms of unlearning. This paper begins to approach unlearning through the tension between art and education, and more specifically through the dialectical relationship between education's dialogic agonism and art's negative antagonism. What is here being proposed as unlearning reflects a critique of the moral-pedagogical outlooks that are imposed on art where artworks are expected to tell stories of truth through their propensity towards the beautiful and the good. In re-reading experiential anticipation as a form of anamnesis (recollection) through a process of negation and contradiction, unlearning is also located in forms of mimetic scoping by which art's assumed pedagogical trajectory turns into the opposite of recollection: as an act of willed forgetfulness. This peculiar 'movement' from a state of learning to that of unlearning constitutes the basis for a special kind of pedagogical aesthetics where the challenges of criticality and laterality articulate a special 'world' where learning may well work backwards. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Emerging research on the brain's cognitive processing systems has led Groff to put forth a new theory of mind, whole-mindedness. Here she presents the evidence and construct for this frame of mind, how it sits in relation to multiple intelligences theory, and how it might redefine the justification for arts education in schools, particularly in our digitally and visually rich world.

A quasi experimental method of research with a pre- and post test was used. The experimental group was taught according to the theory of MI and the control group was instructed based on the traditional method of teaching General English in eight weeks time. In order to determine the effect of MI-based instruction compared with traditional method, a researcher constructed test including 30 items were utilized. In order to assess the attitude of the learners toward English, a 15 items scale of attitude toward English Language was also employed. For analyzing data we used ANCOVA and independent sample t-test. The results of the study indicated that there was a significant difference between improving in General English course between experimental and control groups. In other words, students taught based on MI theory exceeded the traditionally instructed students both in general and in each sub-skill of learning English (vocabulary, reading comprehension, and structure). The results also indicated that attitude of students towards learning English in experimental group improved significantly.},

However, the fields of education, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience use different levels of description to characterize human ability. An important advance in research in educational neuroscience would be the identification of a cognitive and neurocognitive framework at a level of description relatively intuitive to educators. I argue that the theory of multiple intelligences (MI; Gardner, 1983), a conception of the mind that motivated a past generation of teachers, may provide such an opportunity. I criticize MI for doing little to clarify for teachers a core misunderstanding, specifically that MI was only an anatomical map of the mind but not a functional theory that detailed how the mind actually processes information. In an attempt to build a "functional MI" theory, I integrate into MI basic principles of cognitive and neural functioning, namely interregional neural facilitation and inhibition.

It's found that some linkages do exist among strategy use, learning styles, intelligences, and English performance. It's suggested that students be aware of their own strategy use, style preferences and intelligences, and be provided with appropriate use, practice, and chances to use their potential. © Common Ground, Hou Yi-an.},

At present, most of the studies on e-learning either concentrate on technological aspects or focus on adapting learners' interests or browsing behaviours, while, learners' skill level and learners' multiple intelligences are usually neglected. In this paper, an Adaptive and Intelligent Tutoring System (AITS) by expert system based not only on the difficulty level of activities, but also the changing learning performance of the individual learner during the learning process is proposed. Therefore, considering learners' skill level and learners' multiple intelligences can promote personalised learning performance. Learners' skill level is obtained from pre-test result analysis, while learners' multiple intelligences are obtained from questionnaire analysis. After computing learning success rate, the system then modifies the difficulty level or the presentation of corresponding activity to update courseware material sequencing.

The classification performances of different modeling approaches were analyzed and compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves systematically. Results show that the proposed random forest model has the highest accuracy for evaluating slope stability of circular failure mechanism, while the support vector Machine model has the highest accuracy for evaluating slope stability of wedge failure mechanism.

The author conducted an empirical research about application of MI theory in Primary School English class. Two parallel classes were chosen, and one class was taught under the guidance of MI theory, and final evaluations of the two classes were conducted by applying post-tests and interviews. The research data showed that MI-based reading contributed significantly to arousing pupils' interest toward English reading and improving pupils' reading proficiency.},

There are natural barriers between the English and Chinese language which are reflected in teaching approaches. The teaching of English in Chinese classrooms is removed from real-world English learning environments. The academic environments and approaches focus on the learning of grammar, spelling and writing with little real-life conversation and interaction with native English speakers. English language learning in China is from a more academic perspective rather than practical utilisation. Correct pronunciation and accent is therefore diminished.

	abstract = {Spatial intelligence corresponds to one of the intelligences of the model proposed by Howard Gardner in multiple intelligences theory. The viso-spatial intelligence is considered as the ability to think and perceive the world in pictures. People who have this intelligence have a great capacity to think in three dimensions. This intelligence allows a person to perceive images, external and internal, recreate them, transform or modify them, and decode graphic information. Chemical engineering is a profession that is responsible for the planning, construction and operation of chemical and related plants. Chemical engineers must be competent in the use of space either in two or three dimensions, for this purpose they must develop the viso-spatial intelligence, because they must interpret and create planes, read and interpret data, design equipment and plants, understand the spatial connection between the different part of a process, etc. However, we found that our students do not possess the necessary skills to interpret and create drawings and models because in our Faculty of Chemistry no importance is given to the construction of models, equipment and prototypes. This is why the authors of this paper assign projects to four-student teams. The projects consist in designing an equipment that involves calculations and interpretation of graphics, drawings and models. The survey that students have answered indicates that as a result they have improved their visio-space skills. © Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.},

However, in a complex modern society, it is far more challenging for individuals to define and agree upon what is the common good. Nonetheless, two contemporary roles would benefit from embracing a broader sense of the good: 1) membership in a profession; and 2) membership in a polity. Drawing on findings from the GoodWork Project, I describe how the common good can become a guiding value in the professional and civic realms; discuss threats to such guiding values; and suggest some ways to promote the common good in contemporary American society. © 2013 by Howard Gardner.},

The purpose of this study is to analyze physics textbooks for the second grade in a high school in Greece (which concerns students 13 - 14 years old), according Gardner's multiple intelligences theory (MI). For this purpose, 793 activities were detected and analyzed. The analysis of the activities was performed by using a framework of analysis, which consists of the eight types of intelligences according to MI theory. That analysis, which allowed the recording of the activities' distribution in the physics textbook, followed the rules of the MI theory. It was found that the verbal intelligence is present in every activity of the textbook. As for logical mathematical intelligence and spatial intelligence, they are usually present, however, the other types of intelligences are severely limited. The above results have implications both in the field of educational research as well as in the organization of teaching material. © Common Ground, Marina Christopoulou, Michael Skoumios.},

Participants aged 11 to 16 years (M = 14.85, SD = 1.08). The results indicated differentiated in-tellectual profiles depending on the informant estimating students' MI. This study provided evidence for two components that allow us to analyze the cognitive competence of high-ability students beyond the areas com-monly assessed at school: an academic component composed by the lin-guistic, logical-mathematical, naturalistic, and visual-spatial intelligences; and a non-academic component statistically loaded by the bodily-kinesthetic, musical and social intelligences. Convergence of the two com-ponents in the three scales was evidenced; and correlations between these components and students' objective performance on a psychometric intel-ligence test were found to be low. Finally, the utility of the MI scales to identify high-ability students in secondary education is discussed. © 2014: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.},

	abstract = {Dancing in an educational setting is a joyful and powerful means for growth and multimodal learning. Dancing Through the Alphabet, Dancing Math, Dancing Science, Dancing is Being, are four teaching and learning programs, drawing on dance as creative expression and on the reciprocal stimulation of dance, spoken and written language. By stimulating the envy and capability to express oneself and one's knowledge through dance, language learning, mathematics, science, philosophy or other subject learning is enhanced. The core idea is the expression of the self and the perception of previous subject comprehension and further development of skills. Dancing contributes essentially to establishing a fruitful space of learning with immediate and perceptible interaction between teacher, peer learners and the subject learned. Creativity and play, tactile perception and motoric activity are involved in the learning process. Thresholds are lowered and learners eagerly explore fields of knowledge previously experienced as difficult to access. Effective acquisition and sustainable storage of knowledge is enhanced. A continuous development in literacy takes place. Critical reflection is encouraged in a broader view on knowing and being. Concentration and cooperation skills improve. Multiple intelligences are used and cognitive capacities are developed. Participants with varying cultural and language backgrounds, exchanging experiences and references, embark at equal terms on joyful journeys through fields of knowledge. © Common Ground, Paul Moerman, All Rights Reserved.},

Males estimated their general IQ slightly, but mathematic IQ significantly higher than females, who rated their social and emotional intelligence higher than males. Masculine individuals awarded themselves somewhat higher verbal and practical IQ scores than did female participants. Both participant gender and gender role differences in IQ estimates were found, with gender effects stronger in cognitive and gender role than in "personal" ability estimates. There was a significant effect of gender role on hypothetical persons' intelligence evaluations, with masculine targets receiving significantly higher intelligence estimates compared to feminine targets.

Some believe that bilinguals are superior to their monolingual counterparts simply because they have access to two different language systems. On the other hand, there are scholars who believe that bilingualism can impose negative effects on the cognitive development and intelligence in general. This study aimed at comparing linguistic intelligence of Iranian bilinguals and monolinguals regarding their gender. The participants were chosen from the university students, between the ages of 20 up to 30 years old, male and female. There were 100 monolingual (Persian) and bilingual (Persian and Turkish) EFL learners participating in the study. They were administered MIDAS test, and the results were analyzed through SPSS computer program. The findings reveal that there is a significant difference between female bilinguals and monolinguals linguistic intelligence. However the male participants revealed no difference regarding their linguistic intelligence. The results are interpreted to have implications for language class methodologies and syllabus designers, and can be considered as a support to the idea of promoting bilingual education.},

The present paper is a descriptive correlational research. The statistical universe comprises all managers and teachers of public high schools in Tehran. Among 19 districts of Tehran, districts 2, 11 and 16 were selected randomly and among these districts, 60 managers (32 female and 28 male) and 300 teachers (160 female and 140 male) were selected via stratified - relative random sampling as per Morgan table. Data pertaining to multiple intelligences and managers skills were respectively collected through Gardner multiple intelligence questionnaire and interview- administrated questionnaire. The coefficients of Cronbach's alpha for multiple intelligences questionnaire and skills questionnaire are 0.89 and 0.93, respectively. The results of research analyzed via Pearson correlation test and T-test reveal that there is a significant relation between all multiple intelligences dimensions, except for verbal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence, and the managers' technical skills. There is a significant relation between all multiple intelligences dimensions, except for bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and the managers' human skills. There is a significant relation among all multiple intelligences dimensions, except for bodily-kinesthetic intelligence and spatial-visual intelligence, and the managers' conceptual skills. Also there is no significant relation among the managers' gender and their human and conceptual skills, and there is only a significant relation between technical skills and gender, that is, technical skills of female managers are higher than male managers. No significant relation was seen between managers multiple intelligences dimensions and gender.},

	abstract = {Reading comprehension is the most important primary step in the process of education. Book-based training is an intensely effective and fast process that calls for less time and costs than other educational media. Hence, we can say that reading skill is the most important skill that an individual needs to success in his/her studies. This paper intends to examine the relationship of the components of Gardner's multiple intelligences and the thematic and general (personal factors) progression as well as family and school factors with reading skill among fifth-year. The research is a correlative survey. To this end, three questionnaires were used that each measured the questions related to a certain variable and had the average reliability of 0.81 (the average value of Cronbach's Alpha). Three compiled hypotheses were tested and the findings point to the fact that there is a good relationship between reading skills and students'' personal factors (intelligence, general educational progression, thematic educational progression) and family factors (parents' age; number of children; child's ranking; economic, social and cultural status; living environment). Nevertheless, such relationship with students' school factors (teacher's status, teacher's gender, teacher's age and experience, teacher's academic level) is not significant. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.},

	abstract = {This paper presents findings from an action research project that investigated the application of Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory in classrooms and schools. It shows how MI theory was used in the project as a basis for suggestions to generate classroom practices; how participating teachers evaluated the project; and how teachers responded to the professional experience. Teachers reported successful student outcomes including more interest and motivation, better recall and deeper understanding, higher attainment, improved self-esteem, and more fun and enjoyable classroom experiences. For teachers themselves, the project was a challenge. They needed more planning time, more persistence, more collegiality, and more management support. All involved in the project found the experiment worthwhile, exciting, and a stimulus for radical change in their pedagogic practice and thinking. Teachers renamed and extended existing practices to include MI approaches and this led to a methodsshift and, ultimately, to indications of a mind-shift. It was apparent in the Irish MI Project that the premising of curriculum content and delivery, state certificate assessment, school organisational practices, and attitudes on a narrow, untenable and unfair construct of intelligence can result in educational exclusion and disadvantage for many students. Thus, it is suggested that the agency of intelligence in educational failure merits attention.},

	abstract = {What role, if any, should emotions play in clinical reasoning and decision making? Traditionally, emotions have been excluded from clinical reasoning and decision making, but with recent advances in cognitive neuropsychology they are now considered an important component of them. Today, cognition is thought to be a set of complex processes relying on multiple types of intelligences. Tloe role of mathematical logic (hypothetico-deductive thinking) or verbal linguistic intelligence in cognition, for example, is well documented and accepted; however, the role of emotional intelligence has received less attention-especially because its nature and function are not well understood. In this paper, I argue for the inclusion of emotions in clinical reasoning and decision making. To that end, developments in contemporary cognitive neuropsychology are initially examined and analyzed, followed by a review of the medical literature discussing the role of emotions in clinical practice. Next, a published clinical case is reconstructed and used to illustrate the recognition and regulation of emotions played during a series of clinical consultations, which resulted in a positive medical outcome. Tloe paper's main thesis is that emotions, particularly in terms of emotional intelligence as a practical form of intelligence, afford clinical practitioners a robust cognitive resource for providing quality medical care. © The Author 2013.},

The theory of multiple intelligences argues that every person possesses multiple intelligences, emphasizing learners' cognitive richness and the possible role of these differences in enhanced learning. This study is the first to investigate the influence of interactive whiteboards on the learning effectiveness of 4th-grade science students in Taiwan from the perspective of multiple intelligences. The experiment in this study was based on a quasi-experimental design. The results indicated that the learning achievement of the students taught using interactive whiteboards was greater than that of the students taught using lectures. Among the students in the experimental group using interactive whiteboards, the learning achievement of the students with weaker logical-mathematical intelligence was higher than that of those with strong logical-mathematical intelligence. In other words, it can be inferred that the interactive whiteboards achieved good learning effects even for the students with weak logical-mathematical intelligence. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.},

	abstract = {Critical pedagogy claims that the school system serves as a screening tool to separate the talented from less talented. The screening tool function of the school is characterized as credentialism by some sociologists such as J.J. Macionis, g-centrism by some educators such as H. Gardner, and IQ'ism by some education economists such as S. Bowles and H. Gintis. The principle of "equal opportunity" in education, through the industrialization process, have replaced the traditional elitist education, however its effect have continued in "class"ification of liberal capitalism. Here the term "opportunity" refers to liberalism while the term "equality" refers to Marxism. However, Marxism claims that the idea of "equal opportunity" considers only the entry requirements of the educational system while neglecting the equalization of the whole process as well as its rationale. Currently, postmodernism on the one hand, confirms the signals that the inequalities will grow in the modern era especially through the effects of knowledge, ICTs and the information society, but disregards the issue of inequality. On the other hand, postmodernism prepared a ground for creation of new inequalities through the interaction and interrelation among economic, political and cultural fields. The old and the new determinant factor in this ground of inequalities is again education, as P. Bourdieu's named as "cassock aristocracy"and as S. Bowles ve H. Gintis (IQism ve EQism)'s opinions in the field of economy; theories of consumer culture (P. Bourdieu, S. Ewen ve G. Lukacs'in N. Elias, D. Chaney, W. Benjamin ve J. Urry M. Douglas ve B. Isherwood) from cultural field; and N. Chomsky (indoctrination macanism)'s and M. Foucault (eye of power)'s opinions converge here in this ground, as well. Therefore, it is expected that inequalities in education will continue to use new tools, and transform in the postmodern period, the causes of this transformation are analyzed in three sub-dimensions, and this analysis which has been discussed in this review article, aims at diversifying the various solutions.},

	abstract = {The article deals with mechanisms of high school education program construction in terms of learning paradigm in social, epistemological and technological points of view. In undergraduate education the concept of learning paradigm refers to the constructivist approach to learning as a process and to student empowerment process. A study program is defined as a written form of curriculum. In social terms, strategic and political expectations of various interest groups: the academic community, the state and the market are reflected by the objectives and goals of program. In the model of the learning paradigm we must include the learner as a customer and a manager of his own learning process. Meanwhile, the social constructs (public institutions of accreditation; over evaluation of the market approach; the elite academic community) does not dare to transfer their responsibility. In epistemological point of view, the modularization provides flexibility of the program and procedural approach to program construction. However, curriculum content should not be focused only on knowing and acting (competencies required for the market), but also on being − a value for students personal development. Taking in account H. Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory, a study program has to integrate variations in learning styles. Besides, the additional resources must be provided to create rich educational environments and new assessment mechanisms before and after the learning process. © 2014, Vilnius Pedagogical University.

However, the existing educational programs in academic institutions tend to overlook this aspect of training but focus instead on information technology (IT) capabilities. Based on this premise, this study aims to perform a comparative analysis on multiple intelligences (emotional intelligence, social intelligence, and cultural intelligence) of IT/IM students in Canada, China, and Taiwan. The findings of the investigation will contribute toward the formulation of future educational programs for IT/IM and selection of IT/IM personnel by corporations. Students in Canada differ significantly from students in China or Taiwan in the area of emotional and cultural intelligence. However, there is no significant difference between students in China and Taiwan in the area of emotional and cultural intelligence. In terms of social intelligence, there is a significant difference among students in the three study domains. Lastly, there is also a significant difference between genders in both emotional and social intelligence, whereas there is no significant difference in cultural intelligence between the genders. The reasons underlying the differences in multiple intelligences among IT/IM students are also discussed. © Common Ground, Jiunn-Woei Lian, Tzu-Ming Lin, Jim C.

	abstract = {Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor that plays a critical role in the glucose-mediated induction of genes involved in hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis. Circulating blood glucose levels affect ChREBP activity in hepatocytes largely by post-translational mechanisms that include phosphorylation-dependent subcellular localization. Previously, we showed that ChREBP is retained in the cytosol by phosphorylation-dependent binding to 14-3-3 protein dimers and identified the α2 helix (residues 125-135) phospho-Ser 140 domain as the primary 14-3-3 binding site (Sakiyama, H., Wynn, R. M., Lee, W. R., Fukasawa, M., Mizuguchi, H., Gardner, K. H., Repa, J. J., and Uyeda, K. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 24899-24908). To enter the nucleus in response to high glucose, ChREBP must bind importin-α; this heterodimer then forms a complex with importin-β to interact with the nuclear pore complex. In this work, we recharacterized the importin-α binding nuclear localization signal (NLS) of rat ChREBP, identifying it as an extended classical bipartite NLS encompassing minimally residues 158-190. Replacing Lys 159/Lys 190 residues of ChREBP with alanine resulted in loss of importin-α binding, glucose-stimulated transcriptional activity and nuclear localization.Asecondary 14-3-3 protein binding site also was identified, the α3 helix (residues 170-190) phospho-Ser 196 domain. Importin-α and 14-3-3 were found to bind competitively to this secondary site. These results suggest an important mechanism by which importin-α and 14-3-3 control movement of ChREBP in and out of the nucleus in response to changes in glucose levels in liver and thus further suggest that the extended NLS of ChREBP is a critical glucose-sensing, glucose-responsive site.},

	abstract = {In 1999 the Rio de Janeiro Council for Jewish Education set in motion the Innovative Education Program (PIE) at the Israeli Schools of Rio de Janeiro with the purpose of following the recent trends of Brazilian education. The present work has as its objective to analyze the changes occurred in the school atmosphere since the onset and implementation of the program at a Jewish school in Rio. The program's central idea is to work with the concepts of active learning and multiple intelligences as proposed by Piaget, Dewey, and Gardner. To analyze the PIE we used a qualitative approach with the participants of the study through semi-structured interviews and observations in classrooms of the 1st to 5th years of fundamental education. The analysis of the data was based on the theoretical framework. The results indicate that, after the implementation of the program, the professionals involved gained in motivation to search for information and refresh their knowledge in order to attend to the differences between the pupils, making use of diversified strategies and thus encouraging a more dynamic work that facilitates the development of students' autonomy. In terms of difficulties faced in the development of the program, there was mention to the need to revise timetables, and to the fact that teachers now have to go through more extensive curricula. The school is still in the process of adapting to this innovative program, and therefore it is very important that the professionals involved constantly reevaluate the development of the program, trying to identify modifications and alternatives as difficulties arise.},

This study is a research as an experimental model. Research in academic year of 2008/2009 in Foca Izmir Lesbos Reha Country High School 9 Class is conducted on students. In this school, 9th grade class has 72 students. 50% of these students were male and 50% of the female students. For testing the effects of Geography Education supported by 'multiple i{dotless}ntelligence theory and traditional geography education' on retention and achievement of students, controlled pre-test and post-test is used. "Achievement Test is developed to examine the level of student achievement after and before the application. In order to analyze the data, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, t test, KR 20, variance analysis, basic item analysis were used. As a result of the research, it is observed that Multiple Intelligence Theory is effective on students' achievement, but tradtional method is effective on students' permanence of achievement and the only step of the analysis has not been effecctive retention succes; while teaching "atmosphere and climate" in Geography 1 lesson. Next studies can be done in order to test this situation. In addition, secondary school geography lesson operation can be done in different areas or different disciplines. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

This research work presents a set of three different approaches applying intelligent systems for automatic identification of learning styles in order to provide an adapted learning scheme under different software platforms. The first approach uses a neuro-fuzzy network (NFN) to select the best learning style. The second approach combines a NFN to classify learning styles with a genetic algorithm for weight optimization. The learning styles are based on Gardner's Pedagogical Model of Multiple Intelligences. The last approach implements a self-organising feature map (SOM) for identifying learning styles under the Felder-Silverman Model. The three approaches are used by an author tool for building Intelligent Tutoring Systems running under a Web 2.0 collaborative learning platform. The tutoring systems together with the neural networks can also be exported to mobile devices. We present results of three different tutoring systems produced by three implemented authoring tools. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

After identifying attrited words through a 133-word checklist of 12 semantic sets, translation and match-making tasks were devised to investigate the spread of activation. The results showed that the spread of activation is not significantly different between the recognition and production levels or across proficiency levels, and that it is unrelated to the length of disuse. Furthermore, this study shows that the part-set effect exists in semantic sets, so it could be hypothesized that the quick relearning of languages might be due to the spread of activation. Additionally, a significant relationship was found between musical intelligence and the amount of attrition in low attriters, as well as a significant difference between high and low attriters in terms of intrapersonal intelligence. Thus, these might be a few of the variables that are key in reducing the amount of attrition in this study.},

Participants reported a mean of 17.9 (SD=9.54) years of work experience in their field. An examination of the differences in ratings by Special Educators and School Psychologists regarding IEP's indicated that all of the ratings of the Multiple Intelligence (MI) IEP's were more than one point higher than the counterpart IEP's based on traditional assessments. The greatest difference reported in ratings was MI over Traditional IEP's concerning providing more ways for the student to succeed, where the difference was 2.18 points higher for the MI rating. Noteworthy higher ratings between MI and Traditional IEP's were reported concerning social skills (1.92 points) and behavioral skills (1.81 points).

	abstract = {In its 2009 "Job Outlook," the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) reported that employers rated job applicants with communication skills, strong work ethics, teamwork skills, and initiative more highly than those with other skills and attributes. Teamwork skills were tied with strong work ethics and were second only to communication skills. The most desirable team is the high-performing team, which is a high-performance collaborative learning group; a collaborative learning group, which performs above the level of its individual members, is sometimes called a real team. It is difficult for most teams to achieve the level of a high-performance collaborative learning group. For most student teams, it is also difficult to achieve the level of a real team. Hence, student teams should be monitored and supported on a continual basis, rather than merely monitored and evaluated at regular intervals. In an urban university's computing science department, a computer science course taught in three semesters over three years was centrally focused on student learning. The course instances were structured around teams; some were monitored and supported, while others were not. In the course, students kept journals and were taught how to work in teams. The teams were formed by the professor, using a multiple intelligence inventory as well as student provided information on their academic profile. The life-span of each team was the duration of the semester with the task of working together as a unit both in and out of class on all elements of the course except exams. In this paper, we intend to show, for the small sample under study, that with monitoring and supporting of teams and their members, individual and team performances increase toward their optimum values as well as students' desired, expected, and actual performances become better aligned. © Common Ground, Anthony Joseph, Mabel Payne.},

The weekly specialized training hours and years of specialized training was examined to see how it can predict the dominant intelligence with the age factor controlled. There were 355 participants in the research (202 athletes and 153 non-athletes). Collected data were analyzed with one-way MANOVA and multiple hierarchical regression. The results suggested the dominant intelligences of athletes were Interpersonal Intelligence, Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence, and Intrapersonal Intelligence. The weekly specialized training hours and years of specialized training could effectively predict the Interpersonal Intelligence, Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence, and Intrapersonal Intelligence of athletes. The author suggested the future studies could focus on the theory construction of weekly specialized training and years of specialized training. Also, the studies on using "Bridge strategy" by the athletes to guide disadvantage intelligences with dominant intelligences are highly valued.},

The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis. The models compared were: a) a model with six first-order uncorrelated factors, b) a model with six first-order factors and one second-order general factor, g; c) a model with two correlated second-order general factors, in which the cognitive intelligences load on a "cognitive" general factor and the non-cognitive intelligences load on a "non-cognitive" general factor, and d) a model with six first-order correlated factors. The percentage of variance in measured abilities due to g and to first-order factors was also estimated. Overall, the results indicate that the Spectrum activities are not as separate from g as proposed by the defenders of multiple intelligences theory, nor as unitary as argued by the defenders of g factor models. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The degree of violence concerning the environmental problem has currently been increased. Many academics have provided several ideas about causes of the problem. However, they often suggest that the environmental problem comes from humans who always think that they are supernatural. With this reason, they all agreed to conclude that the environmental problem must be solved with humans. The use of the environmental education principles together with both formal and non-formal education will be a mean to help bring the environment back to its normal condition. The purposes of this research were: to investigate the effectiveness index of multiple intelligences integrated learning plans; to study and compare the knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of students before and after the use of multiple intelligences integrated learning and the normal learning and to study and compare the knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of students classified by genders, programs of study and learning methods. The sample used in this research was 60 full time bachelor degree students of all years of study of Chiang Mai Rajabhat University who enrolled to study the course of Humans and Sustainable Environment. They were divided into 2 groups: experimental and controlled groups and were selected by cluster random sampling by drawing. The instruments used for data collection were 2 sets of learning plans, a test of knowledge about environmental conservation, a test of attitude toward environmental conservation and a test for the awareness toward environmental conservation. The first set of multiple intelligences integrated learning plans was used with the experimental group. The second set of normal learning plans was used with the controlled group. The test of knowledge about environmental conservation had 40 items with the difficulty between 0.20 and 0.80, the discrimination between 0.27 and 62 and the reliability for the whole study of 0.87. The test of attitude toward environmental conservation had 20 items. The test of awareness toward environmental conservation had 70 items with 5-rating scale, the discrimination between. About 0.20 and 91 and the reliability for the whole study of 0.98. The data was statistically analyzed by using mean, percentage, standard deviation, t and F-test (three-way MANOVA). The research results were as follows: The effectiveness index of multiple intelligences integrated learning plans was 0.7463. This finding indicated that the learning progress of students was at 74.63%. The levels of knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of the students in general after the use of multiple intelligences integrated learning and normal learning were higher than those before the learning with statistical significance at a level of 0.05. The levels of knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of the students with different genders and programs of study after the learning were not different. The levels of knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of the students with different learning methods were different with statistical significance at a level of 0.05. The knowledge, attitude and awareness about the environmental conservation of the students with multiple intelligences integrated learning were higher than those of students with normal learning with statistically significance. There was no relationship among genders, programs of study and learning methods with the knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of the students in general after the use of multiple intelligences integrated learning and normal learning were higher than those before the learning with statistical significance at a level of 0.05. The levels of knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of the students with different genders and programs of study after the learning were not different. The levels of knowledge, attitude and awareness about environmental conservation of the students with different learning methods were different with statistical significance at a level of 0.05.

Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (MI) has only recently been applied to the field of counselling. This discussion highlights the contribution MI theory and practice can make to developing the therapeutic alliance, to supporting a culture of client feedback, to enhancing counsellor flexibility, and to the overall effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic alliance has been shown to contribute significantly to positive outcomes from counselling. Recent research highlights the positive impact from modifying treatment in response to client needs and interests. Understanding clients' preferred intelligences enhances counsellors' ability to tailor treatment. This article argues that counsellors and their clients could experience increases in the therapeutic alliance, in feedback and the effectiveness of the therapeutic process as a result of using MI theory and practice, offered in the form of expressive therapies.

In this study, we report the children's changes in problem solving abilities in two different types of classes within the program: one in which all children participated together in activities involving problem solving in multiple intelligences (DISCOVER/MI) and another (Talent Development) in which small groups of 1 to 8 children with similar interests and multiple intelligence strengths participated in activities designed especially for them. The scores of teacher assessments showed that most students performed well on closed as well as open problem solving types (Maker & Schiever, 2009), especially on Type 1 (closed), Type 4, and Type 5 (open) in both types of programs, but that they generally performed better on the Type 4 problems than Type 5, and better on both open-ended types when they were in the talent development courses than when they were in the MI courses. Authors concluded that young children whose talents are just developing may perform better on problems with slight limitations (Type 4) because they have had little experience structuring problems, which is necessary in solving Type 5 problems. © 2011 A B Academic Publishers Printed in Great Britain.},

The work load change over time, in various parts of the brain can be observed using the modern imaging techniques like PET, fMRI and so on. This in turn will give and indication of the plasticity of the concerned brain. But this is too costly a method to be adopted for them. Monitoring the progress of the Mentally Challenged children is a challenge from another angle. Their progress is slow. The availability of experts to spend time on them is limited. The society is not ready to spend much on such children, as they are not going to contribute a lot. In such a situation, an easy to use, giving almost 'daily results' will be of great use. This paper is presenting such a simple visual tool, to monitor the progress the of Mentally Challenged children, which any special teacher can operate as the inputs required are just simple assessment of perfection levels attained in different activities by the children.

One application of this theory, albeit still underresearched, is the possible use of visual intelligence to improve L2 learners' lexical acquisition. The objectives of this study were dual: (a) to investigate the relationship between EFL learners' visual intelligence and their vocabulary reception and production, and (b) to determine the relationship between two visually oriented vocabulary presentation tasks (bilingual glosses and bilingual glosses accompanied by pictures) and EFL learners' vocabulary reception and production. To this end, the visual intelligence section of the Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS), a multiple intelligences test, and a test measuring receptive and productive vocabulary acquisition were administered to 91 low-proficiency EFL learners. The results revealed that there was no significant correlation between learners' visual intelligence and their vocabulary reception and production. As to vocabulary enhancement tasks, it was found that the two tasks did not differ in enhancing learners' vocabulary production; however, learners favored the bilingual glosses plus pictures for more gains in receptive vocabulary knowledge. These findings imply that, as a teachable construct, learners' visual intelligence should be activated through instructional consciousness-raising procedures in order to help them draw on it to enhance their vocabulary acquisition. They also imply that lexical input enhancement through marginal glosses plus pictures can be more facilitative in improving vocabulary reception than vocabulary production as the former entails less demanding cognitive and memory operations.},

The study was conducted at De La Salle University-Dasmariñas, Cavite, Philippines with a sample composed of a total of 855 students. These students came from a total of 23 different classes with different courses taking general chemistry. A multiple intelligence inventory test and a multiple choice chemistry achievement tests were used to gather data. Pearson r coefficient of correlation was used to determine if there is a significant relationship between the scores in dominant intelligence and the different cognitive levels of chemistry achievement test. The findings of the study revealed that students posses different dominant intelligence. The study also showed that interpersonal, naturalistic, intrapersonal, verbal, and logical students performed better compared to other MI groups in chemistry achievement test. Positive correlations were found between dominant intelligence scores and mean scores in knowledge level of interpersonal, intrapersonal, verbal, logical and visual students. Positive correlations were also found between dominant intelligence scores and mean scores in comprehension level of interpersonal, intrapersonal, verbal, and logical students. Application mean scores have positive correlations with dominant intelligence scores of interpersonal, naturalistic, and logical students. Based on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were made: College students differ in the dominant intelligence they manifest. There is a significant relationship between the scores in dominant intelligence and the scores in each of the three cognitive levels of chemistry achievement test. © Common Ground, Felipe Martinez, All Rights Reserved.},

Thus, the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes (BADyG: reasoning, memory, verbal aptitude, numerical aptitude and spatial aptitude) and a set of Gardner's multiple intelligence assessment tasks (linguistic, logical, visual/spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalistic and musical intelligences) were administered to 294 children aged 5 to 7. The confirmatory factor analysis points out the absence of a common general factor considering both batteries, indicating instead the existence of two general factors, which gather the tests that encompass them. Also, these two general factors correspond to traditional and multiple intelligence assessments and show a statistically moderate correlation between them. These results challenge Gardner's original position on refusing a general factor of intelligence, especially when considering the cognitive dimensions measured which do not coincide with the more traditional tests of intelligence. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences theory (MI) offers a remedy of wholeness for the traditionally narrow view of general intelligence. Existential intelligence, Gardner's proposed 9th intelligence, potentially adds another critical vantage point of wholeness to the MI canon. Yet Gardner's own narrow definition of existential intelligence has restricted its development for more than a decade. This paper attempts to broaden the definition of existential intelligence by presenting its unique problem solving ability as an invaluable orientation for educators. Specifically, existential intelligence is presented as a vehicle to shore up pedagogy in educational environments that overly fixate on performance-based outcomes or those that ignore the role of educator's calling and purpose. Existential intelligence allows teachers to function within a sphere of questions, creativity, imagination, and journeying. It allows for possibilities instead of prescriptions, informing an education of "essence" and "being" instead of merely "doing" (Greene, 1967, 1995). This paper outlines, through a series of vignettes, the potential gains of encountering existential intelligence in pedagogy and urges further discovery and dialogue regarding this elusive intelligence. Unlike the conscious subscription to existentialist philosophy, the author submits a standing knowledge of existential intelligence is helpful, but is not necessary in order for teachers to function under its offerings. © Common Ground, Matthew Roberts, All Rights Reserved.},

As Marsh (1997) holds "curriculum starts as a plan; it only becomes a reality when teachers implement it with real students in a real classroom" (cited in Anthony, 2008: 77). Since teachers and textbooks are manifestations of education in curriculum, the study intended to investigate how the content of textbooks represents multiple intelligences. In particular, it sought to indicate if the textbooks covered all types of multiple intelligences in line with university disciplines of students. Also, in order to find if MI theory is implemented in the program, a series of semistructured interviews were conducted with university instructors of English. The aim of interviews was to find if instructors apply principles of MI in their classes. The results of this quantitative-qualitative study revealed that ELT textbooks covered a limited range of multiple intelligences i.e. mostly verbal/linguistics intelligence. In addition, the study indicated that MI principles are not applied in the English language classroom. Based on the views of instructors, some suggestions would be made regarding implementing MI in the English language curriculum. The results may be used as a guide for developing teacher education programs in Iran and other countries which are going to implement MI principles in their ELT curriculums. It is hoped that the findings will have an impact on policy makers as well as instructors' concerns about curriculum reform in universities.},

This paper focuses on analysing three choreographies of resistance: the group crawling performance for striking nurses in Helsinki in 2007, the protest by Greenpeace at a nuclear construction site in 2007 and a protest in the 1989 Chinese student movement. The purpose is to shed light on how resisting choreographies can generate interactions and relations between agents keeping these interactions dynamic by the motivations and affections of these agents. I will apply Edmund Husserl's and Edith Stein's phenomenological method of analysing movement and their notion of kinaesthesia. One of the keywords here is 'the kinaesthetic field' that offers a new perspective to account for resisting choreography and its dynamics in socially, politically and emotionally complex environments. Drawing on Howard Gardner's notion of kinaesthetic intelligence, I suggest that the core element of kinaesthetic intelligence is not only control of one's bodily motion but also capabilities for working with kinaesthetic fields. The paper argues that the activists can operate gestures, the vulnerability of the body and timing by drawing various agents into their choreography. When activists are able to express their political ideas as concrete gestures, postures or kinaesthetic relations, it also supports their capabilities of articulating their moral intuitions. Even when witnesses disagree with protesters' positions, protests frequently force them to reconsider their own. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, intelligence was viewed as a single static entity. Revolutionizing the once-dominated "singlestatic entity" conceptualization, Gardner initially (1983) proposed his theory of Multiple intelligences (MI) that encompasses seven different areas of intelligence (verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical-rhythmic, visual-spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal), and later on added the eighth and ninth areas (naturalist and existential) in 1999. Based on the theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI), a person may be viewed as intelligent in any of these areas, and the identification of the dominant intelligence type has proven to have pedagogic implications. McKenzie's MI questionnaire (1999) is one of the established tools to identify the typology of intelligence. The present study aims to validate the Persian version of the MI Inventory (questionnaire) proposed by McKenzie (1999). This instrument provides an objective measure of MI. This paper describes the validation exercise of the abovementioned questionnaire that involved 173 pre-university students of both genders in Tehran. In addition, the variables gender and discipline were also considered in this study. The findings of the study indicate that overall, the Persian version of the questionnaire has a high reliability. In addition, the results show a moderate to high relationship between gender and MI profiles of the students. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present research was to address some fundamental innovative resolutions for EFL learners' encountered impeding dilemmas in reading comprehension. The researchers proceeded to determine the most frequent multiple intelligences (MI) of the EFL learners so as to cater for well-designed tasks to obviate any existing obstacles to ideal reading. Accordingly, by means of a reliable MI profiling questionnaire, the dominant intelligences of EFL learners were highlighted. Moreover, all intended participants were homogenized on the basis of reading proficiency test adopted from First Certificate in English (FCE) whose scores served the purpose of pre-test as well. As a consequence of observed difference between the genders concerning the dominant intelligences, the participants were randomly assigned into distinct control and experimental groups. Furthermore, some evenly selected reading sections from a number of EFL materials, namely, New Inside Out, New Opportunities, and English Online were of primary focus of attention in all groups. As a point of departure, treatment groups were exposed to reading tasks in conformity with already identified dominant intelligences, while the control groups were inclusively conducted under already approached conventional teaching methods of reading in language schools and institutes. The results crystallized the effects of MI-based reading tasks on both EFL male and female learners' reading comprehension. Lastly, findings revealed that EFL female learners emulated their male counterparts' reading comprehension. In sum, the results of such innovative intelligences-based reading task will grant opportunities to discover, value, and enhance the talents of EFL learners in better tackling reading comprehension shortcomings. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER Manufactured in Finland.},

Cluster analysis of the nine talent scores revealed two groups of students with one group significantly higher (n 156) in all talents and a second group significantly lower (n = 169) in comparison. A MANOVA comparing nine talents between year levels (younger/older) and cluster (low/high) showed only one interaction in which the low perceived talent, older students were problematically low on Self-awareness.

Aims: The paper attempts to discuss and explore that under the impact of globalization, the trend of curriculum development in education is to equip students with multiple intelligence that will help them adapt to the environment in future. To successfully implement curriculum reforms, the capacities of instructional and curriculum leadership of school leaders are of key and crucial importance. Discussion focus: Based on Toffler's (1980) theory of "The Third Wave", Friedman's (2005) assertion in his book, "The World is Flat" and Cheng's (2006) conceptualization of "Three Waves in Education Reform", the paper analyses the impact of globalization and information technology on education reforms. It also explores what the trend of curriculum development is in today's educational context. Conclusion: The trend of curriculum development is to equip students with multiple intelligences that will help them adapt to the future environment. These intelligences include social-networking intelligence, economic-managerial intelligence, political-decision making intelligence, scientific-technological intelligence and cultural-moral intelligence. As a successful school leader in the 21st Century, he or she should realize the importance of instructional and curriculum leadership in implementation of curriculum innovations.},

	abstract = {Multiple intelligences, with its hypothesis and implementation, have ascended to a prominent status among the many instructional methodologies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories and concepts are in need of more alternative and interactive assessments to prove their prevalence (Kinugasa, Yamashita, Hayashi, Tominaga, & Yamasaki, 2005). In general, item templates adopted in current on-line testing system are mostly true and false, multiple choice and multiple selection. More sophisticated interactive alternatives such as click and select, drag and drop, link, collide and magnetize are still in great demand. The fact that the lack of template alternatives has made it difficult for the general teachers to incorporate interactive items into testing. To underpin interactive multimedia test, this research has cultivated interactive item template as the basic sharing atomic unit. In addition, a corresponding visual item authoring system Interactive Test Item System (ITIS) (Koong et al., 2007), and an auto-grading examer were developed. Meanwhile, an item sharing website based on Web2.0 was constructed, through which users can exchange the created interactive item templates, interactive items, and interactive test sheet. The design of on-line visual authoring item editor has made it possible to create items by click and select, drag and drop, link, or parameter setting. Multimedia such as text, image, audio, and animation can be added, deleted or set to the wished animated effect to created into an interactive item, while on-line interactive testing as well as auto-grading are supported. The system was applied to the 5th graders to assess their learning performance on Social Studies. Focuses of this research are on investigating: (1) differences between interactive multimedia test and the conventional paper-and-pencil examination; (2) performance of student of different capability with different testing approaches; and (3) testee's opinions toward ITIS. Essential findings are as follows: (1) student's performance was consistent either in interactive test or paper-and-pencil examination, signifying capability can be tested through the system. Also, little discrimination was shown between two types of testing; (2) better performance was indicated when underachievers were implemented interactive multimedia test; and (3) positive attitudes was shown by students who have taken interactive multimedia test. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, first multiple intelligence areas and learning styles of 243 mathematics prospective teachers studying at a state university were identified using the "Multiple Intelligence Inventory for Educators" developed by Armstrong and the "Learning Styles Scale" developed by Kolb. Second, the data was appropriated for rough set analysis and we identified potential learning styles that a student can have based on the learning style s/he already has. Certainty degrees of the learning style sets were αR(D)≅0.717, αR(C)≅0.618, αR(AS)≅0.699, αR(AC)≅0.461, and these sets were found to be rough sets. Finally, decision rules were identified for multiple intelligences and learning styles. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Multiple Intelligences Theory (MIT), proposed by Gardner (1983), claims that there are at least eight different human intelligences. This new view of intelligence with emphasis on learner variable has been used in language learning and teaching settings. The theory stresses that if individual differences are taken into account and classroom activities are diversified, language learners can better improve their language skills. The present study investigates possible relationship between L2 learners' multiple intelligence (MI) and their writing performance. Thirty three female homogeneous Persian speaking EFL learners participated in the study. The instruments used were the Multiple Intelligence Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS), an instrument designed by Shearer in 1996, and the participants' average scores on two writing tasks, as an index of writing products. The correlational analysis of the results revealed a statistically significant relationship between participants' MI and their performance on writing. Furthermore, the results of regression analysis showed that among all eight intelligences, linguistic intelligence is the best predictor of writing performance. The findings suggest English teachers to consider the role of MI in classes and provide more effective activities to help students improve second language writing ability. Possible implications of the findings for language teaching and teaching writing have been discussed.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) is considered an innovation in learning the English language because it helps students develop all eight intelligences that, on the other hand, represent ways people understand the world around them, solve problems and learn. They are: verbal/linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, bodily/kinaesthetic, musical/rhythmic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist. Also, by focusing on the problem-solving activities, teachers, by implementing theory of multiple intelligences, encourage students not only to build their existing language knowledge but also learn new content and skills. Objective: The objective of this study has been to determine the importance of implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Niš Medical School. Methods: Ways in which the theory of multiple intelligences has been implemented in the English language course syllabus particularly in one lecture for junior year students of pharmacy in the University of Niš Medical School. Results: The English language final exam results from February 2009 when compared with the final exam results from June 2007 prior to the implementation of MI theory showed the following: out of 80 junior year students of pharmacy, 40 obtained grade 10 (outstanding), 16 obtained grade 9 (excellent), 11 obtained grade 8 (very good), 4 obtained grade 7 (good) and 9 obtained grade 6 (pass). No student failed. Conclusion: The implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Niš Medical School has had a positive impact on learning the English language and has increased students' interest in language learning. Genarally speaking, this theory offers better understanding of students' intelligence and greater appreciation of their strengths. It provides numerous opportunities for students to use and develop all eight intelligences not just the few they excel in prior to enrolling in a university or college.},

	abstract = {Lent and Brown (2006) suggest guidelines for creating and adapting assessment tools based on the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT -Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994). In the last years, this theory has been the subject of substantial research, both basic and theoretical. The authors indicate that any assessment of SCCT should: (a) contextualize measures to make sure they are grounded in a particular, domain-specific context, (b) be reasonably comprehensive in sampling the domain, designing multifaceted measures when the criterion is correspondingly complex, and (c) ensure compatibility between predictors and criteria along key dimensions, includ ing content, context, temporal orientation, and level of specificity. Additionally, it is important to use reliable and valid tests. Without sound measures, it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish whether theory-discrepant findings are attributable to problems with the theory, flaws in operationalizing it, or both. In Argen ti -na, Cupani and Gnavi (2007) assessed a model of academic performance in Mathematic, based on the SCCT. Cupani and Gnavi adapted the subscales for Mathematic Outcome Expectancies and Performance Goals of the Middle School Self-Efficacy Scale (Fouad, Smith, & Enochs, 1997). Results indicated that the goals subscale has a simple factor structure with adequate internal consistence, although it did not predict academic performance in Mathematic. More over, the Subscale for Mathematics Outcome Expectancies showed low internal consistence and some of its items did not transfer well to our cultural setting. Therefore, two follow-up studies were carried out to improve the psychometric properties of both scales. The first study employed two focus groups (n per group ≥ 8) and aimed at generating ideas on the student's expectations of results and goals on academic achievement in our cultural setting. The information gathered was used to write 7 new items for the goals subscale and 12 items for the outcome expectancies. These items were then test -ed for clarity and understanding in a sample of adolescents. Language corrections were also carried out, yielding two new goals and outcome expectancies scales (11 and 13 items, respectively). On the second study, these scales were administered to a sample of 420 adolescents (M = 13.84; SD = .76). The internal structure of the scales was examined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and their internal consistency was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha. The predictive validity for Academic Achievement in Mathematic was also analyzed. The scale of logical-mathematical self- efficacy from the (revised) Self-efficacy Inventory of Multiple Intelligences (Pérez & Cu pa ni, 2008) was also administered. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a single-factor structure for the scale of performance goals (GFI:.92; CFI:.95, RMSEA:.08) and for the Scale for Mathematic Outcome Expectancies (GFI:.95; CFI:.96, RMSEA:.06) is the most appropriate model for the data gathered. Both scales had optimal Cronbach's alpha values (.86 and.85, for performance goals and outcome expectancies, respectively). The study on predictive validity also showed that logic-mathematic selfefficacy beliefs and achievement goals in Mathematic explain 32% of variance of math school performance. The results show that Academic Achievement in Mathematic is partially explained by the model. In summary, both scales allow a contextualized measurement of outcome expectancies and performance goals on Mathematic in teenagers from our cultural area. These scales have satisfactory psychometric properties, presenting a clear internal structure, and adequate internal consistence. Future application of path analysis will allow a more precise identification of the interrelations between outcome expectancies and performance goals on Math ematic and their direct and indirect effects upon academic achievement in it.},

	abstract = {The "Enrichment Program for Cultivating Problem Solving Abilities and Multiple Intelligences for Gifted Preschoolers" (PSMIGP program) was the first enrichment program for young gifted children in Taiwan. It was an extra-curricular program that was implemented over a 3-year period. The assessment and curriculum were designed by adapting the main part of the DISCOVER curriculum.The purpose of this paper was to introduce the identification model and to analyze the participants' performance in problem solving activities and in demonstrating their special talents. To offer enrichment services for gifted young children, the researchers developed an identification model to discover more young gifted children and serve their needs in learning, regardless of the nature of their talents, disabilities, or cultural or socio-economical status. All participating young children were screened in a three-stage process that included both objective and subjective assessments, including checklists, interviews, portfolio assessment, group intelligence tests, observation in the play corner, individual intelligence tests, and structured observation activities. It was also necessary to adjust the standardized test procedure to fit the needs of twice exceptional young children.In total there were sixty-one preschoolers participated in this three-year program, including eleven twice exceptional children and one child from a new immigrant home. Among these sixty-one preschoolers, eight of them participated in two years of the program; the others only participated in one year of the program.The results of this enrichment program found significant correlations among the measurement scores; the scores of teacher assessment of problem solving abilities also showed that most students performed well on all five kinds of problem solving types. From children's archives, participating children presented scientific thinking characteristics, such as rich knowledge with fascinating imagination and the ability to seek many approaches to solving problems. They were delighted to challenge others and pleased to be challenged. The twice exceptional children also performed well in the program, especially those children with autism whose progress in social skills and group adaptability were remarkable. In sum, the researchers in this program had a belief that children, whether gifted or not, did not get the satisfaction of making progress until they had opportunities to find and develop their potentials. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Unfortunately this shows little sign of abating with a very high proportion of young people displaying cynical and possibly corrosive attitudes around ethics in the workplace. It is clearly important that education should address this problem before it becomes insurmountable. In his recent work on "Five Minds for the Future" (2006), and the Good Work Project (2007), Howard Gardner has proposed the ideals of good work, the Ethical Mind. The affective dimension of these proposals is examined and a conceptual model for affective development is examined and applied to the use of massively multiplayer games. Massively multiplayer ethically epistemic games are identified as the optimum environment for development of the ethical mind as they offer the opportunity to explore situated ethical problems, see the consequences, and experience the emotional impact of the solutions. Dialogue game techniques are also suggested to provide structured discourse and reflection on ethical work issues. Finally, a vision of a massively multiplayer ethically epistemic game is proposed.},

There are three parts of this study: 1) The construction of CDPs: 1,443 SHSs from 20 senior high schools took the Work Value Inventory, the Career Exploration Inventory, the Multiple Intelligences Scales, and the Academic Achievement Tests. Eight CDPs were then identified by means of factor analysis, cannonnical correlation analysis and comprehensive judgement based on 30 variables of the five measures. The eight CDPs were Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional, Humanistic, and Scienticic; 2) The validitaion of CDPs: 327 students from 4 SHSs served as the subjects of validitaion. The "My Charactistics" and the "My Students' Charactistics" checklists and rating scales were devised for students and teachers and exployed as the criteria of concurrent validity. It was found that most of the criterion measures were significantly correlated to CDP measures and had significant differential effects on two extreme CDP groups. However, students' self-reports were found more effective than teachers' ratings, and the concret and checklist method was more effective than the subjective over-all rating, especially for teachers; 3) The application of CDPs: The interpretation of CDPs was made and further revised by focus-group discussion, followed by identifing the subjects with superior CDPs (T≥60) at four senior high schools. It was found that there were 41.6% of the total subjects with one or more superior CDPs. However, there existed salient inter- and intra-individual differences in this regard. Finally, applications and suggestions of CDPs in academic and career counseling are given according to the research findings.},

Revealing vital connections and the interrelations of aspects within a theory, art, and design serves as a means to understand the significance of designing visual communication design artifacts that exhibit wholeness and multidimensionality. The interplay among process, materials, form, senses, text, imagery, visualization, and theory comprise the basis for developing multidimensional forms. It is paramount that designers see how a theory can become practical and embodied within communication design forms. This paper explores how the design of an artifact, a book, encourages audience participation beyond a typical reading experience. The design requires the audience to engage with the form and parts to synthesize the meaning and message of the piece. As a vehicle to pique curiosity, stimulate engagement, and interaction on multiple levels, it provides a reader with different ways of understanding through verbal, visual, tactile, and hands-on methods. Each level presents a different representation or way of revealing the content. This is a vital point, designing with multiple representations to create multidimensionality within one form. © Common Ground, Michelle Hays, All Rights Reserved.},

Results: The study results exposed that there was not a statistically significant difference on dominant intelligence areas and averages of scores of multiple intelligence types in control groups (p> 0.05). Although, the dominant intelligence areas were different (except for first dominant intelligence) in cochlear implanted children in Turkey and Germany, there was not a statistically significant difference on averages of scores of dominant multiple intelligence types. Conclusion: Every hearing impaired child who started training, should be evaluated in terms of multiple intelligence areas and identified strengths and weaknesses.

	abstract = {Interest in emotional intelligence has bloomed over the last few years. That it has become a standard concept in general and applied psychology, as well as in applied business settings, is indubitable. Emotional Intelligence - EQ - is a relatively recent behavioural model, rising to prominence with Daniel Goleman's 1995 Book called 'Emotional Intelligence'. The early Emotional Intelligence theory was originally developed during the 1970s and 80s by the work and writings of psychologists Howard Gardner (Harvard), Peter Salovey (Yale) and John 'Jack' Mayer (New Hampshire). Emotional Intelligence is increasingly relevant to organizational development and developing people, because the EQ principles provide a new way to understand and assess people's behaviours, management styles, attitudes, interpersonal skills, and potential. Emotional Intelligence is an important consideration in human resources planning, job profiling, recruitment interviewing and selection, management development, customer relations and customer service, and more. Emotional Intelligence links strongly with concepts of love and spirituality: bringing compassion and humanity to work, and also to 'Multiple Intelligence' theory which illustrates and measures the range of capabilities people possess, and the fact that everybody has a value. The EQ concept argues that IQ, or conventional intelligence, is too narrow; that there are wider areas of Emotional Intelligence that dictate and enable how successful we are. Success requires more than IQ (Intelligence Quotient), which has tended to be the traditional measure of intelligence, ignoring eseential behavioural and character elements. We've all met people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially and inter-personally inept. And we know that despite possessing a high IQ rating, success does not automatically follow.},

	abstract = {Early research on self-regulated learning mainly focused on the cognitive and meta-cognitive domains. A broadened perspective on learning in the last two decades, illustrated through the development of such concepts as multiple intelligences and emotional intelligence, has elevated the role of emotion and motivation in thinking and learning and in self-regulation. Emotion research has moved from the social science field and joined motivation research in the classroom, although research on specific emotion regulation strategies in the education context has been limited. Of the classroom research undertaken, benefits have been shown to accrue to students who use emotion and motivation regulation strategies in the classroom. In this paper I discuss various types of emotion and motivation regulation strategies and their relevance to the education context. An integrated model of emotion and motivation regulation is presented together with a discussion of practical ways of enhancing emotion and motivation regulation strategy use in school. Finally, I outline those aspects of emotion and motivation regulation theory that are in need of clarification and development. © Common Ground, Leanne Fried.},

The fact that we have different cognitive capabilities compels us to consider them in educational proposals and to develop them in students respecting their individual differences. The present study analyses the intellectual profile of secondary school students and the contexts that promote different cognitive capabilities. The research study is divided into two phases. The first phase seeks to show the diversity of intelligences that coexists in a particular group of secondary school students and their specific talents. The second phase has the purpose of revealing which contexts allow the development and expression of the potential of talented students. The results indicate that each student exhibits a unique intellectual profile. Furthermore, it was found that some extracurricular contexts and environments can act as catalysts for the development of cognitive, artistic and social abilities. © 2012 Fundación Infancia y Aprendizaje, ISSN.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a computer-mediated intersensory learning model as an alternative to traditional instructional approaches for students with learning disabilities (LDs) in the inclusive classroom. Predominant practices of classroom inclusion today reflect the six principles of zero reject, nondiscriminatory evaluation, appropriate education, least restrictive environment, procedural due process, and parental and student participation. These practices guide the amended Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 2004. For nearly 35 years the act has championed for the rights of children with disabilities. The act mandates that students with LDs are educated in the general education classroom (Hock, Deshler, & Schumaker, 1999). Those with LDs are expected to reach a mastery level of the subject matter in the inclusive classroom (Kameenui & Carnine, 1998). Among other things, society now expects all learners of the digital generation to be able to manipulate and process information, and to learn to apply it in their daily lives (Gilbert & Driscoll, 2002). These high expectations place increased demands on students with LDs leading to a need for instructional alternatives to help them succeed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

The study, which is principally qualitative, draws from the accounts of 69 pupils who participated within the intervention during its first four years of inception and from a range of stakeholder accounts - parents, Support Group Leaders, class teachers and senior managers. The intervention focused upon collaborative, discussion-based activities designed to foster reflection, understanding and thinking skills. The study utilizes data drawn from attendance, attainment and discipline statistics, comparing the Support Group population to wider comparator groups, in addition to questionnaires (open and closed), scheduled interviews and focus group discussion. This article focuses specifically upon the extent to which pupils developed intrapersonal intelligence. The findings indicate that the majority of pupils had, to at least an extent, developed greater understanding of their behaviour and that these outcomes were still in evidence up to two years after intervention. © 2011 Association of Educational Psychologists.},

	abstract = {Problem statement: The government of Malaysia is considering serious efforts in promoting the usage of computers among disabled people. Currently, the availability of computer applications especially related to creative contents for disabled people in Malaysia is infancy and very expensive. Research and expertise in the area of Assistive Technology (AT) in Malaysia is still uncommon and not extensively utilized. Therefore research involving special communities such as disabled people on the usage of electronic applications should be focused because records show that their population populations are increasing. Hence, this research will be tailored for Visually-Impaired (VI) learners. In Malaysia, visual impairment is one of the highest registered disabilities. Approach: This study presents an ongoing project that determines whether the VI children can accept the Assistive Courseware (AC) as one of the effective tools in their learning process. Specification identification, AC development and testing and evaluation are three activities involved in this study. In addition, data have been collected through qualitative approaches. Results: The results highlight four important elements for incorporated in an AC for VI children. Through the testing and evaluation, it was found that the VI children accept the AC due to interesting usage of audio, graphic, text and easy navigation method. Conclusion: In a nutshell, the positive responses prove that the AC not only exposes the VI children to the world of technology but also educates them in terms of interpersonal skills, intrapersonal skills and motivation. The recommended future work is to produce a much comprehensive AC which focuses on interactivity, various multimedia elements, multiple intelligence elements and multiple stages of exercise in granting value-added AC not only for VI children in Malaysia but also to other world VI communities in the world. © 2011 Science Publications.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the conceptual and operational bases of analogical problem - solving tests, placing emphasis on figural analogies. The importance of the study of such a hypothetical construct to the understanding of intellectual capacity is briefly outlined. The significance of the construct in relation to mental development and individual maturation from childhood to adulthood is also explained in a concise way. Theoretical considerations about analogical reasoning are quoted and the fundamental characteristics and cognitive mechanisms involved in the resolution of figural matrix items are described. In this respect, the nature of relations and correlations between relations of figures is elucidated taking into account the A:B::C:D proportional model which has been researched by psychometrists since the beginning of the 20th Century. This model suggests the existence of two pairs of relations between elements, where element A is to element B as element C is to a missing element D (Figure 2). Items created on the basis of this structure usually contain given answers, only one of which is correct. On the other hand, linkages are established with contributions from experts defending the cognitive perspective of the study of analogical reasoning, and also with General Psychology schools like Gestalt and Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence. Finally, an ideal framework for the creation of 2 × 2 figural matrices that can measure analogical reasoning is intended to be provided. With the purpose of reducing item bias, six essential suggestions for the preparation and administration of items are offered. These suggestions are: (1) the constructor should consider the double resolution pathway of a proportional analogy (horizontal as well as vertical, i.e. A:B::C:D and A:C::B:D). In doing so, the probability of generating non-controlled rules of analogical relation to one of these pathways will be reduced. These accidental rules correspond to resolution logics different from those chosen by the designer, therefore affecting item manipulation and control. (2) Strongly related to the latter, given that each rule or combination of rules creates one different resolution strategy, each proportional analogy item should incorporate only one of these strategies to be applied horizontally as well as vertically. (3) Given that one or more rules may be used for the same item, a few rules are more than enough to prepare a large group of strategies and, therefore, a large item bank. Also, it is possible to take into account n strategies to produce nk items, being k the number of items apparently different from each other that nevertheless share the same resolution strategy. (4) Items that can be solved by applying ways of reasoning different from those of the proportional analogies should not be constructed. For instance, the designer should not allow superficial comparisons among some matching attributes of the item as a problem solving method, since this procedure does not require the consideration of the whole matrix structure (Gestalt's) which should serve as a basis for the analogical reasoning task. Therefore, pairing analogies should be rejected as they allow for this kind of resolution pathways (e.g. matching circle C with circle D2 in the 4th item of Figure 2, without taking into account the other matrix figures). (5) Alternative responses should contain one clearly correct answer to be discovered by using only analogical reasoning; wrong answers should not replace the correct one just because they are more appropriate considering alternative non-pretended ways of reasoning; all alternatives should share similarities and be distributed on a random basis. (6) The bias arising from admin - istration conditions should be taken into account, including the possible verbal contamination during completion of this non-verbal test.},

	abstract = {This article proposes that consideration could be given to an invitational intervention rather than an expectational intervention when support personnel respond to a critical incident in schools. Intuitively many practitioners know that it is necessary for guidance/counselling personnel to intervene in schools in and following times of trauma. Most educational authorities in Australia have mandated the formulation of a critical incident intervention plan. This article defines the term critical incident and then outlines current intervention processes, discussing the efficacy of debriefing interventions. Recent literature suggests that even though it is accepted that a planned intervention is necessary, there is scant evidence as to the effectiveness of debriefing interventions in stemming later symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. The authors of this article advocate for an expressive therapy intervention that is invitational rather than expectational, arguing that not all people respond to trauma in the same way and to expect that they will need to recall and retell what has happened is most likely a dangerous assumption. A model of invitation using Howard Gardner's (1983) multiple intelligences is proposed so that students are invited to grieve and understand emotionally what is happening to them following a critical incident.},

He believed that enforcing intelligence of people is the ultimate goal of education. This study is applicable in purpose and survey and integrative from approach point of view. This study has been implemented on 298 subjects from the students of post-graduation of Islamic Azad University (Garmsar Unit) who are studying Educational Management during 2009-2011. According to Morgan table, 155 of the /above mentioned subjects has been selected as the study sample. In order to implement the study we have used a questionnaire consisting of 53 questions created by Gardner named "the 8 Intelligent". The final grades of the students in the course of descriptive and interpretive statistics in first and second semester of the educational year of 2010-2011 have been also utilized for the purpose of this survey. The result showed that the surveyed students have a satisfying level of multiple intelligences in general. In the meantime the factors related to math, music, spatial intelligence of Gardner have been analyzed step by step with Regression approach. The results also showed that these factors in a meaningful way can predict the effectiveness of educational variable (P</01).

The dichotomous response format poorly represented the data, as did the scaled response format. However, because of the latter's superior reliability estimates it was chosen for refinement. Through the use of confirmatory factor analysis, the revised CCI replicated the data accurately. In both data samples, bivariate correlations between the Revised-Communication Components Inventory and a measure of learning styles were moderate to large, providing initial validity evidence for an important construct to counselors and their clients. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

	abstract = {When designing with young children, designers usually select user centred design methods based on the children's required level of engagement and the inspiration expected to be created according to the designer. User centred design methods should be selected for their suitability for children and for the quality of the output of the design method. To understand the suitability of design methods, a framework was developed to describe design methods in terms of required design skills as identified by the Theory of Multiple Intelligences. The proposed framework could provide the basis for a tool to compare design methods and to generate hypotheses about what design method would work optimally with children in a specific school grade. The initial examination of the viability of the framework is a comparison of design methods by the number of skills involved; earlier work showed that the involvement of more skills (as with, e.g. low-fi prototyping) could result in more options for a design problem than the involvement of fewer skills (as with e.g. brainstorming). Options and Criteria were counted to understand the quality of the method in terms of the amount of design-information. The results of the current paper indicate that 8-to-10-year-old children generate significantly more options in prototyping sessions than when they are involved in sessions applying a Nominal Group Technique. The paper indicates that (a) with the framework we can generate hypotheses to compare design methods with children and (b) that the outcome of various design methods, which might lead to very different representations, can be compared in terms of Options and Criteria. Further usage of the framework is expected to result in empirical support for selecting a design method to be applied with young children. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The paper posits that Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory and Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences relate levels of challenge, intelligence traits, and capacities to an individual's landscape experience. The article presents a matrix of possible experiences, the Spectrum Matrix derived from Csikszentmihalyi and Gardner, as a generative design tool for use at various points during the design process to enhance a site design's development to provide more opportunities for engaging landscape experiences.

The sample of the study consisted of 102 4th grade elementary teachers, 97 5th grade elementary teachers, and 55 6th, 7th, and 8th grade science and technology teachers, including 254 teachers in total. The data in the study were collected through "The Inventory of Class Activities Done in line with the Intelligence Areas", and "the Semistructured Interview Form". The quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and one-way analysis of variance. The qualitative data were analysed by content analysis as well. It was found that teachers generally used activities addressing for all intelligence areas, they were aware of the multiple intelligence theory, not the subject teachers but the elementary teachers and the senior teachers use teaching activities for more than one intelligence area in their classes. It was determined from the teachers' responses to the questionnaire that teachers were aware of the activities for intelligence areas. However, the interviews revealed that they could not transfer their knowledge about intelligence areas into their classes. Therefore; it could be observed and investigated why teachers did not implement their knowledge about multiple intelligence theory into their classes and their efforts in the preparation, planning, practice and evaluation phases of teaching. © 2011 Eḡitim Dani{dotless}şmanli{dotless}ḡi{dotless} ve Araşti{dotless}rmalari{dotless} İletişim Hizmetleri Tic.

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine the multiple intelligence domains, decision self-esteem and decision-making styles of athletes playing for the national orienteering team and to explore the relationship between these variables. The relational scanning model was used in this study. Totally 30 athletes, 11 female (X age =l 5.90±2.22 years) and 19 male (X age =l 6.73±1.72 years), who play for the Turkish National Orienteering Team voluntarily participated in the research. The data were collected using the Multiple Intelligence Domains Inventory developed by [1] and the The Melbourne Scale of Decision Making (MSDM I-II) adapted to Turkish by [2]. In order to analyze the relationship between decision making self-esteem and decision making styles and multiple intelligence domains, the Spearman's product moment correlation coefficient technique was employed. The data obtained indicated that the intelligence domain in which the orienteers were the strongest is visual-spatial intelligence and the weakest is musical-rhythmical intelligence. In addition, it was observed that the orienteering athletes use the decision making style of decision making self-esteem most and they use the procrastination decision making style least. The findings demonstrated that orienteers' verbal-linguistic intelligence domain becomes manifest as their tendencies of decision making self-esteem and vigilance decision making increase, intrapersonal intelligence domain becomes manifest as the tendency of decision making self-esteem increases and bodily-kinaesfhetic intelligence becomes manifest as their tendency of vigilance decision making increases. Besides, it was observed that athletes' tendency of hypervigilance decision making declines as their intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligence domains become manifest. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.},

This paper discusses the unique characteristics of Gardner's Intrapersonal intelligence domain and assesses its potential in comparison to some other "self" theories commonly found in educational theory and practice. It then argues that the concept of the executive function of intrapersonal intelligence provides a relatively unexplored notion of self that has the potential to empower all those engaged in educational pursuits, irrespective of their diversity. As executive function brings together and interpolates the commonly identified characteristics of successful learners, it is argued that one of the most inclusive ways in which educators can improve student outcomes, build knowledge, skills and strategies that promote personal achievement and prepare young people for the complexity of their world, can be found by exploring this specific aspect of the renowned Multiple ntelligences (MI) paradigm and ways in which it may be enhanced. © Common Ground, Maura Sellars.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper "Made in heaven - produced on earth: creative leadership as art of projection" is about the concept of projection in the context of leadership. Design/methodology/approach: This article takes a close look at Jeff Koons, a successful and highly controversial contemporary artist. The paper explores the way in which storytelling linked to his artwork has been the key element of the way he has projected himself as a credible leader in the world of contemporary art. Findings: This article examines how the artist Koons is using the three universal story lines used by leaders to excite and gain buy-in from an audience as described by the sociologist Howard Gardner: (1) who am I - How life experience has shaped my individuality and character; (2) who are we - Demonstrate the values and behaviors of a group; and (3) where are we going - Explains what is new, and creates a sense of excitement about direction. The authors find that throughout his career and his various artistic production cycles like the inflatables, the New, Equilibrium, Luxury Degradation, Statuary, Kiepenkerl, Banality, Made in Heaven, Puppy, Celebration, Easyfun, Popeye, and Hulk Elvis, Jeff Koons is using key elements of the art of projection by linking his art work to the three universal story lines who am I, who are we, and where are we going. A closer analysis of Koons' work reveals how he has leveraged each of these dimensions of effective storytelling as a broad narrative to link his various series together as a consistent whole. Practical implications: The authors suggest that Koons' use of storytelling, and the manner in which he has come to embody the themes and concepts that he seeks to communicate through his artworks, present powerful lessons for managers as to how they can manage their own leadership projection. By looking at Koons, managers can better understand not only how to establish credibility and drive buy-in, but also how to project themselves as leaders in their respective fields of business endeavor. Originality/value: While there is literature on the art of storytelling there has been less focus on the sphere of art and how artists use storytelling and projection to take their audience with them. This new perspective not only creates new insights on the concept of storytelling and potential future research but has implications for managers and leaders and the way they want to drive change in organizations and take people on their managerial journey. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The aim of this research was to define the factor structure, and reliability of nine talents which are the behavioural outcomes of MIs, using items representing Approaches to Learning. Variability in talents based on the sex of respondents was also analysed. Analysis of the data from self-report questionnaires provided by 241 adolescents showed nine clear and reliable factors. The highest rated factors were Physical and Sport Activity, Musical and Rhythmic, followed by Construction and Spatial Design. Weak sex effects showed that males rated themselves higher on Mathematical and Logical, and Construction and Spatial Design factors and females rated themselves higher on the factors of Self-awareness, and Nature and the Environment. The factor structure and high internal consistency of factors of this instrument indicate that linking Approaches to Learning and MIs is a promising approach for further research.},

	abstract = {Hagfish slime threads are an interesting intermediate filament (IF) system in that, in contrast to hair, they appear to be a series system of IFs, consisting of rods and terminal domains (TDs), without matrix. The protein composition also differs from hair. Published data show that the wet stress-strain curve consists of four regions: I, increasing low modulus; II, plateau; III increasing higher modulus; IV decreasing modulus to break. Beyond 34% extension, there is plastic deformation, which contrasts with the elastic deformation of most biological fibres. The paper considers two explanations, one published by Fudge et al. [D.S. Fudge, K.H. Gardner, V.T. Forsyth, C. Riekel, J.M. Gosline, Biophys. J. 85 (2003) 2015] and one new, of deformation in the four regions. The former regards the TDs as elastic, entropic coils, which extend in region I. The latter regards the TDs as having a plastic, energy-dependent extension in regions III and IV, which is comparable to the drawing of polyester fibres. A rough theoretical model of jumps over energy barriers gives a similar prediction. Twist is suggested as a mechanism for overall thread cohesion. Experimental and theoretical ways forward to a greater understanding of the structural mechanics of hagfish threads are suggested. The behaviour of the total thread/mucus/water system is discussed and some speculations on the defensive mechanisms that have evolved are presented. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, existing information literacy (IL) teaching approaches have not always been successful in equipping students with these crucial skills to ensure deep erudition and long-lasting retention. Hence, sound pedagogical approaches become critical in IL education. This research hypothesizes that students grasp IL skills more effectively when their innate interests, such as that determined by their respective dominant intelligences, are stimulated and applied to their work. Consequently, they would produce work of better quality. To verify these postulations, an IL course was designed for students undertaking project work to equip them with the necessary IL skills, by using an established pedagogical approach - Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Subsequently the quality of students' project work between the experimental and control groups were compared.

There have been a great number of Korean practitioners who have properly applied an ideal of MI theory in their local context. Western readers will be informed of how actively these educators participate in the grass-roots reform process. A traditional or teacher-based image of Oriental education culture may have to be redefined, at least in the current Korean educational context. In doing so, the authors reviewed related literature and research articles written by Korean scholars and practitioners as well as conducting in-depth and focus-group interviews nationwide to represent voices of Korean MI educators at school level. There has been substantive evidence that most students guided by MI instruction demonstrated better achievement in several subject areas; students typically labeled low achievers in traditional classrooms became better self-regulated learners, showing higher self-esteem. Finally, the Korean research community experienced the emergence of a new collaborative research culture in which MI educators are fully acknowledged as curriculum designers and researchers able to gain insight into culturally appropriate classroom practices. The authors end this paper reflecting on a future hope that the Korean research community will continue, both critically and collaboratively, to examine MI theory to make it more applicable in establishing culturally relevant pedagogical insights.},

	abstract = {Education in this 21st century is concerned with developing intelligences. Problem solving in real-world contexts involves multiple ways of knowing and learning. Intelligence in the real world involves not only learning how to do things effectively but also more importantly the ability to deal with novelty and growing our capacity to adapt, select and shape our interactions with the environment. Knowledge in this new millennium is increasingly characterized by the creative integration of information and learning from diverse disciplines. Educators, policy makers and researchers need to be aware of new approaches of dealing with knowledge and information where problems can be used innovatively in pedagogies. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an inquiry-based pedagogy that is best rooted in sound understanding of the psychological processes of problem solving and the development of cognition. Whilst many educators support the need to develop multiple intelligences, few realize that one of the best ways to draw forth these intelligences is to understand the psychology of using real world problem scenarios and engaging inquiry. This paper addresses the state-of-the-art of PBL along three themes. The first is the psychology of cognition, metacognition, and self-regulation in problem-based pedagogies. The second is the idea of making thinking and mind visible through dialogue and inquiry. The third theme is the use of learning environments beyond the boundaries of the classroom to enhance problem-based thinking. Finally, the implications for educational innovation and practices are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

There is a compelling need to address health and safety training with innovative methods including e-learning tools, which offer several advantages in terms of the effectiveness of instructional activities. This paper reports on the progress of an ongoing Socrates-Minerva project that aims to create an instructional design framework for virtual classes to deliver health and safety training. The research is based on the theory of multiple intelligences (MI), which postulates that there are several independent ability areas that individuals possess. Translating MI principles from a traditional classroom into an e-learning environment represents a new and challenging initiative. Pilot virtual classes (VCs), which are being developed by teams from five different countries, focus on falls from heights, which constitute around 40% of fatalities in the European construction industry. The evaluation of the initial results suggests that learners are generally satisfied with the basic elements of the pilot delivery of the VC on hazards of falls, although more effort is needed to incorporate synchronous elements into instruction and create a more interactive learning environment. Personnel with direct line responsibility for health and safety on construction projects, professional and regulatory bodies charged with ensuring health and safety standards and training, and researchers are the principal beneficiaries. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

A regression analysis indicated that the best predictors of self-estimated overall "g" intelligence were self-estimated verbal and numeric intelligences. Children's age and sex, and parents' age and sex, were all non-significant predictors of the overall "g" score estimates of the first two children. There were no sex differences in experience of, or attitudes towards, intelligence testing.

In the study a pre-test/post-test with control group experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the 2004-2005 school year using a sample of 120 students in the 7 th grade (Experimental group 1=30, Experimental group 2=30, Control group 1=30, and Control group 2=30). At the beginning of the study a prior knowledge test, science attitude scale and Multiple Intelligence Fields Determination Scale were completed by the students. At the end of the study an achievement determination questionnaire was completed by the students in the experimental and control groups. Instructional material including student worksheets, student practice questions and a teacher guide were prepared by the researchers on the Freehand MXa program. In teaching the subject to the experimental groups, a holistic instructional approach was used that combined reliance on multiple intelligence theory, a constructivist approach, deliberate use of analogies and an emphasis on science process skills. In addition, concept maps and an animation were used. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Cohen's size effect, and the Scheffe Test with the SPSS 11.00 program at the.05 significance level. At the beginning of the study, it was found that while there was no statistically significant difference between the students of the experimental and control groups, at the end of the study levels of achievement of the students on this subject in the two experimental groups were higher than both control groups. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology 2002.},

Participants rated themselves on general and specific abilities from three popular models of intelligence: Gardner's multiple intelligences, Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence, and Goleman's emotional intelligence. The results showed that (a) laypeople across nations have similar and invariant concepts of intelligence, (b) concepts of intelligence are cross-culturally closely related to academic notions of intellectual ability and (c) sex differences in general and specific SEI favouring men are consistent across countries. Male hubris and female humility in SEI seem independent of sex differences in actual cognitive ability and national levels of masculinity-femininity. Furthermore, international mean differences in general SEI could not be attributed to discrepancies in national intelligence quotient (IQ) levels or to cultural variations. © 2009 The British Psychological Society.},

Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, 1999) revealed that by drawing on a combination of preferred intelligences, children were able to enhance the dialogue between the unconscious and conscious, while strengthening the relationship between the counsellor and client. A number of useful counselling approaches are highlighted in working with children, particularly younger children who have not yet developed language sufficient for more formal counselling sessions. Suggestions that assist counsellors to operate across settings are explored. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This pilot study looks at the relationship between learning style, as measured with the Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS), laparoscopic surgery experience and psychomotor skill performance using the MIST VR surgical simulator. Methods: Five groups of volunteer subjects were selected from undergraduate tertiary students, medical students, novice surgical trainees, advanced surgical trainees and experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Each group was administered the MIDAS followed by two simulated surgical tasks on the MIST VR simulator. Results: There was a striking homogeny of learning styles amongst experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Significant differences in the distribution of primary learning styles were found (P < .01) between subjects with minimal surgical training and those with considerable experience. A bodily-kinesthetic learning style, irrespective of experience, was associated with the best performance of the laparoscopic tasks. Conclusion: This is the first study to highlight the relationship between learning style, psychomotor skill and laparoscopic surgical experience with implications for surgeon selection, training and credentialling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In this paper, I explore the ideas of the theoretical physicist David Bohm, the psychoanalysts Lacan and Irigaray and those of psychologists and educationalists Peter Salovey, Howard Gardner and Edward de Bono in order to consider a range of problems and issues that inform our thinking. It seems that thinking can, on the one hand, be the source of our problems and difficulties in learning or, on the other hand, be the source of our freedom and creativity in learning. At times, thought controls us and at other times we are in control of our thinking, it could be argued. Bohm likes to think of thoughts as a system informed by the body, feelings, states of mind, historical associations and emotional associations and much more. Here the work of Lacan provides a most interesting parallel where the unconscious mind may sabotage our inspired or intuitive thinking or perhaps, on the other hand, provide a creative aspect that could remain untapped. Is thinking structured like a language one may ask? Irigaray has suggested that the unconscious may be gendered which further complicates our thinking processes and forces us to factor in the sexed body as a key element, especially in the intricate emotional fabric informing our thinking landscape. Finally, I argue that it is our emotional fluency that enables us to navigate the rough terrain of the thinking landscape, one that is often imposed on us by others, institutions and cultures. This landscape can be challenged by our creative spirit, our passion for something 'other' and our desire to grow and learn as we age. The emotional fabric of our lives is intimately connected to creativity, I argue, and may remain untapped unless there is a conscious desire to learn and grow. Explorations into our emotional life force us to examine the depths of our thinking. In this way, we can make our learning come alive from the inside out, rather than as something imposed from the outside. Ultimately, creative and inspired thinking and learning is open to all. © Common Ground, Lesley Caust.},

Participants (N = 200) estimated their own levels of the eight abilities, completed two maximum performance tests of each ability, and provided self-ratings of their personality characteristics. As observed in previous research, most participants tended to overestimate their levels of ability in most of the intelligence domains. Self-estimated ability levels were generally only modestly correlated with measured levels of the same ability, and tended to show equally strong correlations with personality variables. Sex differences were observed for self-estimates of some abilities, and these sex differences were largely independent of measured ability and personality. It was concluded that high levels of self-estimated ability were related to being male, having high measured ability, and being high in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience, and low in Emotionality. © 2008 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to present the findings of a study that investigated the impact of information literacy (IL) teaching approaches, which are grounded in pedagogy, on students' level and applicability of IL competencies. Design/methodology/approach - A quasi-experimental control group study was carried out with 476 students, aged from 13 to 15 years old, from four secondary (high) schools in Singapore. The students were given a pre-intervention test in the beginning. Out of the 476 students, 279 students (from two schools) went through a mediated learning intervention programme, while the remaining 197 students went through a multiple intelligence intervention programme. Students were organised into smaller groups of five each, and were given a group project to do. Students in the experimental sub-clusters were exposed to the respective intervention approaches, while students in the control sub-clusters were left on their own to carry out the project. A post-intervention test was administered to all students at the end of the intervention programmes. Findings - The results of the group reports and project evaluation doneby three independent and neutral teacher-examiners, as well as those from the pre-and post-intervention tests, found that the application of either mediated learning (or close coaching) or multiple intelligences helped students perform better in the learning and application of IL skills. Research limitations/implications - The study managed to involve 476 students from four secondary (high) schools only. A larger number of students from more schools would have been more desirable. In addition, the inclusion of students from primary (elementary) schools and tertiary institutions would be useful in strengthening the findings. However, the study has sufficiently provided evidence that appropriate pedagogy is important in enhancing the learning and application of IL competencies amongst students. This could in turn yield initiatives on various aspects of IL-related research, such as in IL policy formulation, and IL pedagogy. Practical implications - The application of appropriate pedagogical approaches in teaching IL makes the learning and application of IL competencies more effective. Originality/value - Although it is widely accepted that IL competencies are useful in helping students perform better, both academically or otherwise, limited empirical evidence is available showing the relationship between IL education and IL competencies. The paper highlights the impact of appropriate pedagogy in imparting and entrenching IL competencies in students.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the topic of "highly intelligent" children in Turkey (Baltaş, 2006; Bozdaǧ, 2001; Bümen, 2002; Demirel, Erdem& Başbay, 2006; Goleman, 2007; Koçer, 2005; Kulaksizoǧiu, Bilgili & Şirin, 2004; Onay, 2006; Saban, 2005; Yavuz, 2001; Zohar & Marshall, 2004). However, the general understanding of "intelligence" seems to be the psychometric definition consisting of the logical, mathematical, and verbal intelligences supposedly measured by IQ tests. In the US, currently IQ score is the main determining factor in access to gifted programs (Ascher, 1992; Borland, 2003; Sapon-Shevin, 1994). A similar situation is observed in Turkey though such schools are not as widespread. The purpose of this paper is to examine the emergence of the psychometric definition in the West, look at its analysis through a Foucauldian lens (Borland, 2003) in order to increase awareness about what IQ really means, make suggestions for Turkey about the use of the tests and underline possible alternative approaches. © 2008 Eǧitim Danişmanliǧi ve Araştirmalari İlctişim Hizmctlcri Tic.

Despite their hardships, learners interviewed in this study showed resourcefulness, empathy, optimism, sensitivity, and an openness to starting life in a new culture. These qualities have been linked to intra and interpersonal dimensions of intelligence proposed by theorists like Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg. Ten teachers who work with either adolescents or adults from war affected backgrounds were also interviewed. This study took place in Winnipeg, Canada—a moderately sized Canadian city, and home to increasing numbers of new immigrants and refugees from different corners of the world.

It is now considered as a construct made up of many traits that can be developed. This broadened conception of giftedness not only focuses on many kinds of aptitudes, talents and potentials for advanced learning that exist in all school populations, but also proposes to provide every student with opportunities, resources and the necessary encouragement to achieve his or her maximum potential Hence, the labelling game has been reduced and the field is now emerging as one that embraces quality education for all.

	abstract = {estimations of IQ were examined using Gardnerés (1999) list of 10 multiple intelligences. A total of 197 Macanese (90 male and 107 female) and 331 Portuguese (139 male and 192 female) students participated in the investigation. The following hypotheses were tested: it was anticipated that there would be sex differences in self-rated mathematical and spatial intelligence, with men giving higher self-estimates than women; it was predicted that there would be cultural differences between Macanese and Portuguese, with the former awarding themselves and their parents significantly lower scores than the latter; participants would rate their fathers as more intelligent overall than their mothers; the best predictors of overall (g) IQ would be logical/mathematical, spatial, and verbal intelligence. In contrast to previous results (Furnham, 2001), when examined separately, gender differences in both self-estimates and parents estimates did not occur in the Macanese sample. There were, however, consistent and clear culture differences. Portuguese gave higher self and family ratings than Macanese, as expected. Portuguese rated their verbal, body kinetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligence higher than did Macanese. Portuguese rated verbal, mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential, and naturalistic fatherés intelligence higher than did Macanese. Portuguese rated verbal, mathematical, spatial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential, spiritual, and naturalistic motherés intelligence higher than did Macanese. Participants of both cultures rated overall intelligence of their father higher than that of their mother. This was also to be expected as previous studies have shown this to be the case in terms of gender stereotyping. In both cultures verbal and interpersonal intelligences predict overall intelligence. However, in Macao, body-kinetic and intrapersonal intelligences, and in Portugal logical and naturalistic intelligences, also predict overall intelligence. Implications of these results for education and self-presentations are considered. Les diffrences sexuelles et culturelles entre les tudiants universitaires macanais et portugais relativement aux estimations de leur propre QI et de celui de leurs parents ont t examines léaide de la liste de dix intelligences multiples de Gardner (1999). Un total de 197 tudiants macanais (90 hommes e4t 107 femmes) et de 331 tudiants portugais (139 hommes et 192 femmes) ont particip cette tude. Les hypothses suivantes furent testes: (1) des diffrences sexuelles taient prvues dans les estimations de léintelligence sur les plans mathmatique et spatial, avec les hommes qui auraient des valuations plus leves de leur propre intelligence que les femmes; (2) des diffrences culturelles taient prvues entre les Macanais et les Portugais, avec les premiers qui séattribueraient eux-mmes ainsi qué leurs parents des scores plus faibles déintelligence que ces derniers; (3) il tait attendu que les participants valuent leur pre comme globalement plus intelligent que leur mre; (4) il tait attendu que les meilleurs prdicteurs du QI global (g) seraient les intelligences logique/mathmatique, spatiale et verbale. Contrairement aux rsultats prcdents (Furnham, 2001), lorsquéelles furent examins sparment, les diffrences de genre la fois dans les estimations de léintelligence propre et dans les estimations de léintelligence des parents ne se sont pas produites dans léchantillon macanais. Il y avait cependant des diffrences culturelles claires. Tel quéattendu, les Portugais se sont attribu des scores plus levs tant pour les valuations de leur propre intelligence que pour celles de léintelligence de leurs parents, comparativement aux Macanais. Les Portugais ont valu leur propre intelligence de faon suprieure sur les plans verbal, corporel dynamique, interpersonnel, personnel et naturaliste comparativement aux Macanais. Les Portugais ont valu léintelligence de leur pre de faon suprieure sur les plans verbal, mathmatique, spatial, interpersonnel, personnel, existentiel et naturaliste. Aussi, ils ont valu léintelligence de leur mre de faon suprieure sur les plans verbal, mathmatique, spatial, musical, interpersonnel, personnel, existentiel, spirituel et naturaliste. Les participants des deux cultures ont valu léintelligence globale de leur pre de faon suprieure celle de leur mre. Ceci tait galement attendu en raison du fait que les tudes antrieures ont montr que cela correspondait un strotype de genre. Dans les deux cultures, les intelligences verbale et interpersonnelle ont permis de prdire léintelligence globale. Cependant, léintelligence globale fut aussi prdite, Macao, par les intelligences corporelle dynamique et personnelle et, au Portugal, par les intelligences logique et naturaliste. Les implications de ces rsultats pour léducation et la reprsentation de soi sont discutes. Se examinaron, usando la lista de Gardner (1999) de inteligencias mltiples, las diferencias entre sexo y cultura de estudiantes universitarios de Macao y portugueses respecto a sus propias apreciaciones de su cociente intelectual y las de sus padres. Particip en la investigacin un total de 197 estudiantes de Macao (90 hombres y 107 mujeres) y 331 portugueses (139 hombres y 192 mujeres). Se someti a prueba las siguientes hiptesis: se anticip que habra diferencias entre sexos en la autoapreciacin de las inteligencias matemtica y espacial, otorgndose los hombres calificaciones ms altas que las mujeres; se predijo que habra diferencias culturales entre los de Macao y portugueses, al otorgarse los primeros, tanto los estudiantes como sus padres, calificaciones significativamente ms bajas que los segundos; los participantes calificaran a sus padres en general como ms inteligentes que a sus madres; los mejores predictores del cociente intelectual general (g) seran la inteligencia lgico/matemtica, la espacial y la verbal. En contraste con resultados previos (Furnham, 2001), al examinarse por separado, no hubo diferencias de gnero en la muestra de Macao, tanto en las autoapreciaciones como en las apreciaciones de los padres. Hubo, sin embargo, diferencias culturales consistentes y claras. Los portugueses dieron calificaciones ms altas, tanto las propias como las apreciaciones de la familia, como se esperaba. Los portugueses calificaron ms alto su inteligencia verbal, cintica corporal, interpersonal, intrapersonal, y naturalista. Los portugueses calificaron ms alto la inteligencia verbal, espacial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existencial y naturalista de sus padres, en comparacin con los de de Macao. Los portugueses calificaron ms alto la inteligencia verbal, matemtica, espacial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existencial, espiritual y naturalista de sus madres, en comparacin con los de Macao. Los participantes de ambas culturas calificaron la inteligencia general de sus padres ms alto que la de sus madres. Esto tambin se esperaba de estudios anteriores que han mostrado que este es el caso en trminos del estereotipo de gnero. En ambas culturas son las inteligencias verbal e interpersonal las que predicen la inteligencia general. Sin embargo, en Macao las inteligencias cintico corporal e intrapersonal, y en Portugal la lgica y la naturalista tambin predicen la inteligencia general.

	abstract = {In his theory of multiple intelligences, Gardner (1999) argued that certain intelligences were valued in the schools while others were not. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of these school-valued intelligences with general factor intelligence as self-estimated by individuals. To achieve this purpose, we used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between self-estimated IQ scores and self-estimated school-valued intelligences as operationalized by Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (1983; 1999) as being the function of linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences. In surveying 321 students at a large, public university located in the southwestern United States, we found a weak but significant relationship between self-estimates of these school-valued intelligences and g-factor intelligence. Additionally, we found sex differences in the self-estimations of g factor intelligence (IQ scores). To conclude, this study examined the existence of the above-average effect in the sample. © NAJP.},

The six criticisms are: the tension that exists between the concept of multiple intelligences and the standardized evaluations, the disregard of components of the real curriculum - which is not necessarily exhausted in the prescribed curriculum, the risks of teaching for the test, the incentives that are generated to cheat or inflate the results of the tests, the lack of consideration of the economic differences of the pupils who are evaluated, and, finally, the limitations of the results of standardized evaluations to predict the labour success of the students. This paper concludes that this type of evaluations, though they have certain advantages, when used as the only instrument to make educational decisions, the costs outweigh the benefits.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of multiple intelligences (MI) studies in Turkey. Consequently, a systematic analysis of these studies is crucial in order to be able to see the present situation and future trends in the field of education. By this way, it is also hoped that the current analysis will offer an avenue for experienced educators to start dialogues about the use of the MI theory and will provide some guidance to especially new researchers interested in conducting a study on the application of the MI theory in schools. In this research, studies of the multiple intelligences (MI) theory (i.e., master's theses and doctoral dissertations that are indexed by the Higher Education Council's National Thesis Center as well as research articles that are published in the journals indexed by the ULAKBIM Social Sciences Database) between the years of 1999 and 2007 were analyzed with regard to various variables in terms of their content. The studies that were included in this research (i.e., 71 master's theses, 8 doctoral dissertations, and 18 research articles) were analyzed based on 25 themes. According to the results, most studies were conducted in the form of master's theses (73.2%) during the year of 2006 (44.3%) in Ankara (28.9%) by female researchers (60.8%) empirically (63.9%) with the aim of finding out the effect of the MI theory on elementary students'(56.7%) academic achievement in and attitudes towards science (25.8%). The study concludes that more qualitative studies are needed concerning the question of "how can children's multiple intelligences be developed?" © 2009 Eǧitim Danişmanhǧi ve Araşirrmalan İletişim Hizmerleri Tic.

Based on the associations among perceived intelligence scores, three dimensions could be distinguished to describe giftedness and could be interpreted as global giftedness, socioemotional giftedness, and artistic giftedness. Using profiles of perceived intelligences, students could be classified as falling into four clusters of supersmart students, socioemotionally gifted students, modest gifted students, and artistically gifted students. The supersmart students engaged in more activities related to leadership and creativity than the other clusters of students, with the modest gifted students reporting the least engagement. The supersmart students, however, were rated by teachers as less emotionally mature, showing less concern for others, and more likely to have behavioral conduct problems than the socioemotionally gifted students. Implications of the findings for conceptualizing giftedness and working with different groups of gifted students are discussed. © 2008 National Association for Gifted Children.},

In the study, The "Teaching Styles Scale" developed by Serin, Bulut Serin and Serin (2005) and the "Multiple Intelligence Inventory" developed by Saban (2002) were administered to reveal the teaching styles and multiple intelligences of the teachers, respectively. In the analysis of the data, t-test and multiple regressions have been used. The results indicate that there are statistically significant differences between the primary teachers working in İzmir and those working in Lefkoşa when the relationships between their strengths in multiple intelligences and the sub components of their teaching styles such as courageousness, being a model, and planning are considered. There is also a significant difference between gender and planning, but no significant differences between the multiple intelligence types and the other subcomponents of the teaching styles. The t-test results on the regression coefficient depict that variables such as spatial/visual, naturalistic, and interpersonal intelligences play a predictive role on teaching strategies. © 2009.},

However, many questions remain about the impact and processes of creative partnerships. The field of creativity research has been dominated by two key questions: how should creativity be defined and is it possible to teach creativity? Much has been written which attempts to shed light on the answers to these questions so it is important that creative partnerships' work is understood in the context of what it already known from research and theory. A welcome aspect of Creative Partnerships is the desire to ensure an evidence base to support the creative work happening in schools. Frequently this evidence base has been built in part by using action research methodology which has a strong track record in the context of practitioner research. This paper reports on work done with Creative Partnerships which involved the use of an action research framework to support creative work. It is concluded that there are potential problems with assuming that creativity will be enhanced by approaches such as multiple intelligence without careful thought about the way in which creativity is defined. It is also shown that action research does have the potential to enhance creative work but that one of the most important aspects of this is the relationships that are built between mentors and teachers. © 2007 ASPE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the results of research aimed at collecting the data necessary for preparing personalised content of e-learning courses. Its aim is to show how the information describing individual learning styles can be linked to the rules of creating tailored online courses. Design/methodology/approach: The paper gives a brief explanation of how personalization is understood for the purpose of research carried out by the author and what are the psychological backgrounds of the applied approach. It presents also a KS-TIW questionnaire, based on Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence theory. Findings: As it is not possible to define infinite number of different course models corresponding to every single learner a concept of defining several learner profiles which would represent various types of learning preferences is described. Practical implications: The final part of the paper shows how the data concerning one's learning preferences can be transferred into particular type of learning content with special emphasis on a form of learning content delivery and type of activities planned for individual learner. Originality/value: This research goes one step further than typical approach to personalization in e-learning, which is usually understood either by freedom of choosing the time and the place of learning or by adapting the layout of virtual learning environment (VLE) to one's individual needs. Quite rarely the solutions offered in VLE's enable the learner to choose among the forms and methods the learning content is delivered. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In contrast to previous results (A. Furnham, 2001) sex differences in self-estimates did not occur in this Guinean sample. Participants rated overall intelligence of their father higher than that of their mother. An existing data set on estimates of intelligence in a Portuguese sample was used for a cross-cultural comparison between Portuguese and Guinean participants. There were consistent and clear culture differences. Guinean gave higher self, partner and family ratings than Portuguese. Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the self-estimates of intelligence, as well as limitations of that approach. © 2009 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

This study uncovers that there are four important factors affecting how MI science lessons are planned and carried out. They are: (1) identifying individual students' multiple intelligences or strengths via a reliable and valid tool, (2) paying attention to the literature findings related to students' difficulties in learning the relevant science topic, (3) considering the nature of the knowledge structure that students are supposed to learn with respect to the MI, and (4) examining teacher's ability to manage the MI activity.},

However, empirical studies on the construct have relied on text-based organizational identity descriptions, with little exploration of multiple intelligences, emotions and individual/collective identity representations. In this paper, we briefly review the empirical literature on organizational identity, and propose a novel method for empirical study involving structured interventions in which management teams develop representations of the identities of their organizations using three-dimensional construction toy materials. Our study has five main implications. By engaging in a method that draws on multiple intelligences, participants in this study generated multifaceted and innovative representations of the identities of their organizations. The object-mediated, playful nature of the method provided a safe context for emotional expression. Because it involved the collection of both individual and collective-level data, the technique led to collective constructions of highly varying degrees of 'sharedness'. Finally, the organizational identity representations integrated unconscious or 'tacit' understandings, which led to the enactment of organizational change. © 2007 British Academy of Management.},

In the early 1980s, Howard Gardner presented a theory of multiple intelligences by proposing that humans can be described not by a single kind of intelligence, or intelligence quotient score, but rather by a variety of kinds of intelligence. This idea of considering multiple views of intelligence has helped educators look at intelligence from a less rigid, more expansive perspective. I considered how the relatively new concept of naturalistic intelligence, which is the cognitive potential to process information that is exhibited by expert naturalists, might influence the design of undergraduate biology curricula. Naturalistic intelligence can be fostered in undergraduate biology students by emphasizing the need for well-rounded scientific naturalists; developing curricula that involves students in outdoor inquiry-based projects; and helping students learn how to observe both the natural world and their own learning, skills that are essential to developing expert naturalistic knowledge. Professors, graduate students, and administrators can improve the naturalistic intelligence of undergraduate biology students by giving these students opportunities to be involved in outdoor research. Time spent outdoors alone and among people with expertise in natural history, ecology, and conservation biology will have important influences on the knowledge and skills biology undergraduates learn, the careers they pursue, and the contributions they make to conserving Earth's biodiversity. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

On many college campuses, hip-hop's influence has begun to extend beyond the classroom.

Hip-Hop based cultural groups have begun appearing, and several campuses have hosted hip-hop conferences.

It looks to aesthetics and art criticism as a guide to a philosophical treatment of wellbeing goods more generally.

	abstract = {Modern global managers are required to possess a set of competencies or multiple intelligences in order to meet pressing business challenges. Hence, expanding global managers' competencies is becoming an important issue. Many scholars and specialists have proposed various competency models containing a list of required competencies. But it is hard for someone to master a broad set of competencies at the same time. Here arises an imperative issue on how to enrich global managers' competencies by way of segmenting a set of competencies into some portions in order to facilitate competency development with a stepwise mode. To solve this issue involving the vagueness of human judgments, we have proposed an effective method combining fuzzy logic and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to segment required competencies for better promoting the competency development of global managers. Additionally, an empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. © 2005.},

And to contribute to the recommendations for the problems which will be reported considering the application process. A five point Likert scale, developed by the researchers, was used in this research. This study consisted of teachers and principals of 43 primary schools and 69 primary school inspectors working in Antalya province. Specific descriptive analyses which were conducted to calculate the data included percentage, frequency, means, standard deviation, t-test and one-way ANOVA and In case, homogeneity was violated Kruskall Wallis H and Mann Whitney U tests were used. An alpha level of 0.05 was set for all the analyses. The findings show that there was not significant difference between the views of inspectors, principals and classroom teachers concerning the application of new curriculum. The inspectors, principals and teachers reported that they agreed too much to "conceptual framework" of the programme, they did not agree much to "adequacy of teaching-learning process" and they agreed moderately to "Human and substance dimension" of the programme. On the other hand, the more the number of the students in the classroom, the less the achievement of the new curriculum was reported. Recommendations: Inspectors, principals and classroom teachers should be provided with courses and seminars presenting the requirements of the new approach. Classrooms should be redesigned in accordance with the new curriculum and the number of the students must be limited up to 30 students to construct and offer more effective learning opportunities.},

Gardner (1999) claims that all individuals possess eight types of multiple intelligences, which are verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, music, visual-spatial, kinaesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. Understanding of these profiles may lead one to a better understanding of self and how individual learn. This study adopts a descriptive approach, using questionnaires as the means to collect data. The objectives of this paper are firstly to examine the learners' profile of multiple intelligences, determines the correlation among intelligences, and then to suggest the learning activities based on the multiple intelligences. As a result of this study, it was found that there were positive correlations among the variables, thereby suggesting alternative routes to effective Japanese language learning via more than two kinds of learning strategies. © Common Ground, Wei Hui Suan, Tajularipin Sulaiman, All Rights Reserved, Permissions.},

	abstract = {Background: Teachers of sexuality education can often be uncertain about what theoretical basis and pedagogical strategies to use in their teaching. Sexuality educational programmes designed by teachers can often show few evident theoretical principles that have been applied in its construction. Thus, there seems to be a dearth of evidence of ways in which teachers can use appropriate theoretical foundations in their planning and teaching in sexuality education. Purpose: This paper aims to suggest a way of providing such an appropriate theoretical framework for sexuality education teachers of young people aged 7-15 years of age. Analysis: Age-appropriate primary and middle school pedagogies based on two integrated educational theories, namely Anderson and Krathwohl's theoretical framework of learning and teaching, with Verbal Linguistic Intelligence from Gardner's Multiple Intelligences, were analysed and evaluated. Key considerations were the earlier maturing of girls and boys, findings from relevant literature about children and young people's cognitive capacities, as well as the relevance of curriculum content for upper primary and middle school students, and the concomitant need for better and earlier sexuality education. Conclusion: This approach, integrating Anderson and Krathwohl's theoretical framework of learning and teaching, with Gardner's Multiple Verbal Linguistic Intelligence, may be useful to assist health and sexuality education teachers in identifying and anchoring pedagogies in a more theoretically structured manner, thereby enhancing the quality of their sexuality education planning and teaching. © 2010 NFER.},

These students perceived their strengths in intrapersonal, interpersonal and verbal-linguistic intelligences, and their weaknesses in bodily-kinesthetic and naturalist intelligences. They also rated themselves higher on leadership flexibility and goal orientation than on leadership self-efficacy. In predicting the three leadership components, intrapersonal and verbal-linguistic intelligences emerged as common and significant predictors, suggesting that self-reflection and self-management skills as well as a good command of language use were important in leadership. Other significant predictors such as logical-mathematical intelligence for leadership self-efficacy as well as goal orientation and interpersonal intelligence for leadership flexibility suggested that critical thinking might be important for the sense of confidence or efficacy and the vision of goals, whereas relational or people skills might be important for the openness to different options. Students who were classified high on both verbal-linguistic intelligence and personal intelligences, high on one and low on the other, and low on both were found to be generally high, medium and low on all three leadership components, respectively. Implications of the findings for inferring different levels of components of leadership giftedness from specific intelligences and for developing leadership training programs are discussed.},

They also answered six simple questions concerning intelligence and intelligence tests. There were various sex differences in self-estimated IQ: males rated themselves higher on overall, mathematical, spatial, intrapersonal, spiritual, and naturalistic IQ compared with females. Multiple regressions indicated that verbal, logical, and intrapersonal intelligence were significant predictors for self and parents overall IQ estimations.

	abstract = {This article is about the benefits of self-assessment and its use in language education. The main focus is on auto-évaluation as a means of beginning class in an organized and motivating way. In contrast to 'bell work' or other start-of-period activities on random topics, auto-évaluation involves asking questions that are closely tied to what is being studied in class. Every day, students answer questions, discuss, and evaluate their responses, and record their mark on a marking grid. An example of the grid is provided along with sample questions related to Grade 9 core French. These questions illustrate how one can take into consideration students' 'multiple intelligences,' as well as their needs and interests. In addition to daily auto-évaluation, other ideas are presented on incorporating self-assessment into one's classes. © 2007 The Canadian Modern Language Review.},

	abstract = {Mandelate racemase from Pseudomonas putida catalyzes the Mg 2+-dependent 1,1-proton transfer that interconverts the enantiomers of mandelate. Residues of the 20s and 50s loops determine, in part, the topology and polarity of the active site and hence the substrate specificity. Previously, we proposed that, during racemization, the phenyl ring of mandelate moves between an S-pocket comprised of residues from the 50s loop and an R-pocket comprised of residues from the 20s loop [Siddiqi, F., Bourque, J. R., Jiang, H., Gardner, M., St. Maurice, M., Blouin, C., and Bearne, S. L. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 9013-9021]. The 20s loop constitutes a mobile β-meander flap that covers the active site cavity shielding it from solvent and controlling entry and egress of ligands. To understand the role of the 20s loop in catalysis and substrate specificity, we constructed a series of mutants (V22A, V22I, V22F, T24S, A25V, V26A, V26L, V26F, V29A, V29L, V29F, V26A/V29L, and V22I/V29L) in which the sizes of hydrophobic side chains of the loop residues were varied. Catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for all mutants were reduced between 6- and 40-fold with the exception of those of V22I, V26A, V29L, and V22I/V29L which had near wildtype efficiencies with mandelate. Thr 24 and Ala 25, located at the tip of the 20s loop, were particularly sensitive to minor alterations in the size of their hydrophobic side chains; however, most mutations were tolerated quite well, suggesting that flap mobility could compensate for increases in the steric bulk of hydrophobic side chains. With the exception of V29L, with mandelate as the substrate, and V22F and V26A/V29L, with 2-naphthylglycolate (2-NG) as the substrate, the values of kcat and Km were not altered in a manner consistent with steric obstruction of the R-pocket, perhaps due to flap mobility compensating for the increased size of the hydrophobic side chains. Surprisingly, V22I and V29L catalyzed the racemization of the bulkier substrate 2-NG with kcat/Km values ∼2-fold greater than those observed for wild-type mandelate racemase. Although minor changes in substrate specificity were achieved through alterations of the active site flap of mandelate racemase, our results suggest that hydrophobic residues that reside on a flexible flap and define the topology of an active site through their van der Waals contacts with the substrate are quite tolerant of a variety of steric substitutions. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

It has been suggested that the use of creative arts media enables one to surface well-springs of knowledge and critique it artistically, cognitively and meta-cognitively. Recent research highlights the sense of graduate nurses being unprepared at the completion of their undergraduate studies to face the responsibilities and challenges of being a registered nurse. Confronted as an educator with the challenge to address this sense of un-preparedness, Jenny sought to introduce an element of creative reflectivity into a final year clinical practice unit of the Bachelor of Nursing. This was done in anticipation that it might encourage students to draw upon their multiple intelligences, embrace their artistic intelligence and realise their knowledge and learning. This paper presents through a reflective dialogue, the approach taken by the authors sharing their experiences of the introduction of reflective creativity into the course. Examples of creative works produced by students are celebrated, as are the responses to those works. Students expressed their learning, in many differing media and in doing so gained a sense of realisation that during their course of study they had actually acquired a knowledge base to engage as novice practitioners. As educators it raised a significant issue of being caught up in the creativity of the student and the need to see beyond the creation into the meaning and reflection of what it offered. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.},

This review is designed to introduce ways of viewing nontechnical competence from the psychology of human capacity to current perspectives, initiatives and needs in practice. After an introduction to the tensions inherent in educating individuals for both biomedical competency and "bedside" or "cageside" manner, the paper presents a brief overview of the major lines of inquiry into intelligence theory and how theories of multiple intelligences can build a foundation for conceptualizing professional and life skills. The discussion then moves from broad concepts of intelligence to more specific workplace skill sets, with an emphasis on professional medical education. This section introduces the research on noncognitive variables in various disciplines, the growing emphasis on competency based education, and the SKA movement in veterinary education. The next section presents the evidence that nontechnical, noncognitive or humanistic skills influence achievement in academic settings, medical education and clinical performance, as well as the challenges faced when educational priorities must be made. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

These eight IQs are considered critical elements in the decision-making capabilities of global managers. Following this discussion, the composition of global groups and their impact on the decision-making process is explored to determine how the composition of the group inhibits/supports the global manager. The next step in the decision-making process discussed in the paper is that of the nature of the task(s). The type of task can have a direct impact on the effectiveness as well as the efficiency of global manager's decision-making.

The present study employed a different concept of ability, namely, Fleishman's (1975) structure of human performance, to investigate the psychometric structure of self-estimates. A structural equation model generally confirmed Fleishman's apriori taxonomy. In addition, the structure of self-estimated abilities closely resembled models of measured cognitive ability (e.g., Carroll, 1993) and one latent trait, termed general factor ù, was identified. Modest sex differences in self-estimated ability were confirmed in favor of men; however, the latter were noteworthy only for the domains of spatial orientation and physical strengths. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2009 Hogrefe Publishing.},

	abstract = {In his book, Five Minds for the Future (2006), Howard Gardner offers both a constructive critique of current educational practices and an alternative vision for the future of education. Gardner, best known for his seminal work on multiple intelligences, grounds his major conclusions primarily on the results of his impressive, decade-long, and massive Good Works Project. Despite my several agreements and significant overlap with Howard Gardner, I believe that there is insufficient evidence to accept fully his policy prescriptions. Gardner's selection of the five minds of the future - the disciplined, synthesizing, creating, respectful, and ethical minds - is based on a set of limiting assumptions concerning globalization, good work, individuality, power and control, disciplines as value-free enterprises, ethics as the point of view of the universe, and the completeness of his list. This paper suggests that our conception of education might be dramatically expanded to include a more critical and distanced stance towards: globalization, the current goals of business, individualism, the traditional disciplines, and even ethics than Gardner currently imagines. Its aims can and should be broadened to include not only good work, but also love and play. Students must learn how to control their environments, but also how to appreciate and accept life's inevitable difficulties and limits. Ethics should certainly play a more central role in education as Gardner correctly emphasizes, but our understanding of ethics must include not only respect but also care; not only principles but also dialog. To accomplish all of this, however, requires us to think beyond Gardner's five minds to include additional "mental dispositions" like the caring, critical, intersubjective, spiritual, and joyful minds. Each of these "minds" is explored in this paper. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to deepen the understanding of tensions between old and new in the emerging global society driven by information and communication technology (ICT); and to argue that creation of a theory of this society would contribute in the easing of these tensions. Design/methodology/approach The methods used in this paper are mostly analytical, descriptive, and qualitative. An analysis of the creation and development of ICT from a mathematical discipline of computer science to a universal tool and a driving force of the emerging global society, a development which is paralleled by the commercialization of ICT, is followed by two case studies illustrating the tensions between old and new and the role ICT plays in them. One case is centered on the challenges of traditional models of education by new, ICT-friendly approaches, like the Multiple Intelligences Theory; the other addresses tensions between old and new that in many societies presently take the form of tensions between local/national and global. Findings A claim is formed that the existing tensions between old and new are closely linked to the tensions between the two most common forms of society, inclusive (egalitarian) and exclusive (elitist). Originality/value The paper will help understand some of the reactions to the process of globalization. It can serve as a tool for assessment and prediction regarding this process. Lastly, the paper contains a justification of merit in the creation of a “grass root” theory of an ICT-driven global society built on a universally accepted ethical foundation. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

From this point of view this survey aimed on identifying differences in MI development of the Accountancy course from Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana (UNIOESTE), Marechal Candido Rondon campus, in relation to the courses of Administration, Geography, History and Language, as well as among the Accountancy different classes and genders, that justify the proposition of specific teaching strategies for this course, its classes and genders. For the data analysis we have used the average percentage obtained from the MI, the ANOVA test and the Scheffe test. Analyses indicated that the Accountancy course is different from the Languages course in relation to the logical-mathematical MI development; it also differs from the History and Languages courses in relation to the MI linguistics development, and from the Geography course in relation to the naturalist MI. Among the classes, differences were found in the MI linguistics development in the second and fourth years, the interpersonal MI in the first and second years, and in the second and third years. There were no statistically significant differences as to the MI development between genders. It is concluded that the course must stimulate the linguistics MI development through activities that involve reading, review, debates and seminars, and base its methods mainly in logical-mathematical MI through works with calculations and analyses or dynamics that require logical reasoning. © FECAP.},

	abstract = {This investigative paper and research explores the Theory of Multiple Intelligence (MI) as defined by Gardner (1983, 1999) and its applicability in the assessment and education of commercial pilots. Multiple intelligence theory proposes that individuals have eight distinct intelligences with strengths in one or more of the intellects. The authors suggest that MI theory is more useful in describing cognitive processes in aviators than singular (IQ score) or general intellect theories. Beyond just describing cognitions, MI theory could be used to improve pilot training by expanding on educational methods suggested by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Currently, most instructional methods for pilots are traditional in nature, which utilize lectures, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and one-on-one tutorial lessons. MI theory has rarely been applied to the design of aviation education (Craig & Garcia, 2001). To determine a pilot's intelligence profile, the Multiple Intelligence Developmental Assessment Scale (MIDAS) was utilized in this investigation. From a sample of 31 professional aviators and 55 college flight students a common MI profile became evident. A descriptive analysis of the MIDAS scores indicated that both professional pilots and flight students scored high on Intrapersonal and Spatial Intelligence. The "pilot profile" found in this investigation replicates past research in the development of the MIDAS. Because most pilots in this study have similar profiles, educational programs could capitalize on these intellectual strengths. Furthermore, if a flight student scores low on important intellectual strengths for flight, instructional and learning strategies could be implemented to match the student's intellectual strengths.},

	abstract = {This study is part of a programmatic research effort into the determinants of self-assessed abilities. It examined cross-cultural differences in beliefs about intelligence and self- and other-estimated intelligence in two countries at extreme ends of the European continent. In all, 172 British and 272 Turkish students completed a three-part questionnaire where they estimated their parents', partners' and own multiple intelligences (Gardner (10) and Sternberg (3)). They also completed a measure of the 'big five' personality scales and rated six questions about intelligence. The British sample had more experience with IQ tests than the Turks. The majority of participants in both groups did not believe in sex differences in intelligence but did think there were race differences. They also believed that intelligence was primarily inherited. Participants rated their social and emotional intelligence highly (around one standard deviation above the norm). Results suggested that there were more cultural than sex differences in all the ratings, with various interactions mainly due to the British sample differentiating more between the sexes than the Turks. Males rated their overall, verbal, logical, spatial, creative and practical intelligence higher than females. Turks rated their musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence as well as existential, naturalistic, emotional, creative, and practical intelligence higher than the British. There was evidence of participants rating their fathers' intelligence on most factors higher than their mothers'. Factor analysis of the ten Gardner intelligences yield two clear factors: cognitive and social intelligence. The first factor was impacted by sex but not culture; it was the other way round for the second factor. Regressions showed that five factors predicted overall estimates: sex (male), age (older), test experience (has done tests), extraversion (strong) and openness (strong). Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the field. © 2009 International Union of Psychological Science.},

The traditional methods teachers use in history lessons and direct information transfer based only on memorization have an effect upon student's developing negative attitude towards history lessons. Besides that, students tend to memorize since they are put in a passive position and the lesson is teacher centred decreasing their analytical thinking. This sort of teaching strategy offers an easy way for the student, Who likes memorising the things. Thus, the student develops a positive attitude towards the lesson and find it easy to learn. However, students have multiple intelligences. Therefore, it is necessary that some teaching strategies based on Brain-Based Theory should be given a place in the classrooms in order to train individuals who are modern and can question and make logical connection between events to lower the negative attitudes towards history lessons.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of DISCOVER, a performance-based assessment, in identifying gifted students in Lebanon. DISCOVER is grounded in Gardner’s MI theory and consists of tasks involving problem-solving and creative abilities. The sample consisted of 49 middle-class 5-th graders, with a mean age of 10.2 years attending a private school in Beirut, Lebanon. High correlations were found between the participants’ DISCOVER ratings and their corresponding school grades in mathematical, spatial analytical and written linguistic intelligences. Discrepancies were found between students’ grades and corresponding DISCOVER ratings in spatial artistic and oral linguistic intelligences. However, 19% of the participants were identifi ed, with no gender differences.Findings were corroborated by interviews with the teachers. The researcher concludes the DISCOVER instrument holds promise for identifying gifted Lebanese children, but advises research on larger samples of Lebanese students should be conducted before drawing solid conclusions. © 2007, © 2007 — World Council for Gifted and Talented Children.

Through this examination it is suggested that MI theory validates dance as a domain of knowledge–as the embodiment of “intelligence possible”–and an argument is advanced for the reconsideration of the goals and purposes of dance education. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Previously, it was reported that a newly isolated microbial culture, Clavibacter sp. strain ALA2, produced trihydroxy unsaturated fatty acids, diepxoy bicyclic fatty acids, and tetrahydroxyfuranyl fatty acids (THFAs) from linoleic acid (C. T. Hou, J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 73:1359-1362, 1996; C. T. Hou and R. J. Forman III, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 24:275-276, 2000; C. T. Hou, H. Gardner, and W. Brown, J. Am. Oil Chem.

In this study, we found that Clavibacter sp. strain ALA2 produced novel THFAs, including 13,16-dihydroxy-12-THFA, 15-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (13,16-dihydroxy-THFA), and 7,13,16-trihydroxy-12, 15-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (7,13,16-trihydroxy-THFA), from α-linolenic acid (9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid). The chemical structures of these products were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The optimum incubation temperature was 30°C for production of both hydroxy-THFAs. 13,16-Dihydroxy-THFA was detected after 2 days of incubation, and the concentration reached 45 mg/50 ml after 7 days of incubation; 7,13,16-trihydroxy-THFA was not detected after 2 days of incubation, but the concentration reached 9 mg/50 ml after 7 days of incubation. The total yield of both 13,16-dihydroxy-THFA and 7,13,16-trihydroxy-THFA was 67% (wt/wt) after 7 days of incubation at 30°C and 200 rpm. In previous studies, it was reported that Clavibacter sp. strain ALA2 oxidized the C-7, C-12, C-13, C-16, and C-17 positions of linoleic acid (n-6) into hydroxy groups. In this case, the bond between the C-16 and C-17 carbon atoms is saturated. In α-linolenic acid (n-3), however, the bond between the C-16 and C-17 carbon atoms is unsaturated. It seems that enzymes of strain ALA2 oxidized the C-12-C-13 and C-16-C-17 double bonds into dihydroxy groups first and then converted them to hydroxy-THFAs.},

This paper describes the development of a CAD tool, Church Builder, designed for use by children, which is fast, fun and easy to learn and has minimal system requirements. The tool treats the underlying data of the 3D models as a tree structure of nodes, consisting of parameterized representations of the components of the objects being modeled. The tool automatically generates graphics primitives that enable the visualization of and interaction with the object, allowing children to rapidly build sophisticated model church structures. © 2007 by CAD Solutions.},

According to this theory, the intelligence domains actively used by each student is different. Therefore, multiple intelligence is important for finding out the differences among students and making them actively participate into the science courses as individuals having different intelligence domains. In this study, the lesson plans were considered to initialize the different intelligence domains of the students. The lesson plans consisted of the name of the unit, subject, duration, equipments, materials used, objects, introduction, development and results of the lesson and the theory of multiple-intelligence.

Metacognitive theory considers learning as the result of the activation of several conscious processes. Furthermore, our project intends to support meaningful learning by means of Addizionario and to investigate the processes involved in motivated learning. Motivation to learn is favoured also by a general strategic attitude towards learning, especially when in learning we consider the intellectual peculiarities of the child. This hypothesis is well illustrated in the concept of "multiple intelligence" of H. Gardner, according to which each person has a preference for a symbolic code and through such a code manages more easily to learn and take interest in disciplines, activities etc. Using Addizionario, we tried, furthermore, to support the development of divergent patterns: in fact, the access and the development of more different symbolic and known universes is anyway an important means of transforming the multiple potentialities of the single child into real abilities, also for creativity and divergent thought. We believe that creative behaviour in childhood is a factor favouring the processes of learning and the psychological well-being of the child.},

The questions of convergent and discriminant validity is tackled by examination of correlations of emotional intelligence scores and scores on the Multiple Intelligences Checklist for Adults (MICA) and information processing preferences as measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).

Developed for use with children 3-8 years of age, the LTAS helps teachers understand what children know in relation to key concepts in the different disciplines as well as how they learn in order to further their learning in subsequent days and weeks of teaching. The development of the LTAS is based primarily on two theoretical frameworks: Leont'ev's activity theory and Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. To examine the efficacy of the LTAS in its proposed objectives, a pilot study was conducted; results point to the potential of the LTAS for helping student teachers uncover new information about children to guide future instruction. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

They also point out a lack of empirical investigation in this area and discuss possible measurements of spiritual intelligence through specific subscales of spirituality measures. To conceptualize existential intelligence, the authors start from existential thinking in psychology. As meaning in life is a central concept of existential psychology, they suggest that existential intelligence could be understood as an ability to find and realize adequate life meaning. In the conclusion, they argue for an understanding of spiritual and existential intelligence as non-identical, however, mutually related and overlapping constructs.},

Gardner's focus on bodily-kinesthetic intelligence as both a means of communication and cognitive mode for Graham falls short of explaining Graham's polymathy. Rather, Graham exercised a wide range of imaginative tools commonly used by successful individuals across the arts and sciences and indicative of general creative skills that cut across cognitive domains. In the effort to place dance firmly within a transdisciplinary education, the tools-for-thinking approach provides dance educators with more powerful support than Gardner's multiple intelligences. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The rate of expansion into the global marketplace by multinational corporations has begun to accelerate at a pace where international human resource managers are unable to meet the demand for managers to serve in global assignments. This shortage of qualified managers is exacerbated by a number of societal trends, such as, dual-career professional couples, increased number of high qualified female executives who have not been used extensively in international assignments in the past, and the changing format and sequencing of the overseas assignments beyond the traditional single 3-5 year assignment term. The complexity of global management tasks is increasing requiring multi-talented managers capable of acting as knowledge-integrating boundary-spanners in global network organizations. Inpatriate managers (i.e., host-/third-country nationals relocated to the home organization on a semi-permanent to permanent basis) have been identified as a potential pool of global managers to complement the supply of expatriates for emerging markets. This paper develops a means for selecting inpatriate managers based on a multiple IQ approach that attempts to match the inpatriate managers' portfolio of abilities with the type of assignments that they might have in global organizations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Persons of different cultural backgrounds can hold diverse perceptions of what constitutes an effective, efficient and satisfying information-seeking experience, and digital library design therefore grows more complex when its user population traverses cultural boundaries. This paper reviews the state of research on cross-cultural digital library usability and identifies reasons for lack of progress in the field. An improved framework is proposed to support the discussion and evaluation of subjective cultural factors in a deeper, more systematic fashion. The cognitive theory of Howard Gardner, multiple intelligences theory, is explored as one potential framework for exploring cross-cultural digital library usability. Each component of Gardner's theory is introduced, placed in a cultural context, and then briefly reviewed in terms of its potential application to digital libraries. Alternative frameworks, particularly the cultural dimensions theory of Geert Hofstede, are also introduced. Multiple intelligences theory is found to be helpful for understanding the nature of cultural variables, but not readily translatable into operational design principles for digital libraries. Combining multiple intelligences cognitive theory with cultural theory and global HCI design principles may prove a useful direction for future research.},

All these new theories and proposed measurement instruments pose a challenge to traditional cognitive ability tests since it is claimed that these tests are more valid and have lower adverse impact. The chapter states that many of these tests are nothing more than pop psychology. It is found that the key studies cited repeatedly by advocates of new concepts do not meet the Daubert criteria for scientific evidence. Further, studies and challenges are reviewed on the basis of use of a particular measure as a personnel selection instrument. The chapter concludes that novel concepts detract from legitimate theories of intelligence and from the development of constructs and operational tests, and provide more effective employee selection tools to meet prevailing legal challenges. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Often one hears that leaders lead through action, by example. But more often, and often more effectively, leaders lead through their words, by acts of speech, as it were. They are frequently called upon to speak and write, formally and informally, to convey their vision for their organization to their staff and constituents. In doing so, they are not only announcing that vision, but are engaging in a rhetorical negotiation with their audience, trying out words, phrases, and literary constructions to better and more convincingly communicate their vision of their organization and the direction in which they wish to take it. If their rhetoric fails, or is not wholly successful, they strive to change or modify it. Through such verbal exchanges, leaders communicate the style and substance of their leadership and give form and imaginative life to their vision for the organization. Howard Gardner (1995), the Harvard psychologist, has written that ‘[L]eaders achieve their effectiveness chiefly through the stories they relate’. He calls these stories ‘stories of identity’, narratives ‘that help individuals think about and feel who they are, where they come from, and where they are headed’ and that such stories ‘constitute the single most powerful weapon in the leader’s literary arsenal’. This essay recounts, as a case study, the role of such stories in the turnaround of an organization, the Harvard University Art Museums, and reflects generally on the role of rhetoric in leadership. © 2005, Sage Publications.

In this article we review the co-existence of 'superiority' and 'inferiority'. Patients and methods. A study was made of six children aged between 6 and 8 years old at the Instituto de Belles Artes Antonio Maria Valencia in Cali, Columbia with an educational level between second and third grade at a primary school and of medium-low socio-economic status. The children were considered to have superior musical ability by music experts, which is the way in which the concept of 'superiority' was to be tested. The concept of 'inferiority' was tested by neuropsychological tests = 1.5 DE below normal for the same age. We estimated the perinatal neurological risk in each case. Subsequently the children's general intelligence and specific cognitive abilities were evaluated. In the first case the WISC-R and MSCA were used. The neuropsychological profiles were obtained by broad evaluation using a verbal fluency test, a test using counters, Boston vocabulary test, the Wechster memory scale, sequential verbal memory test, super-imposed figures test, Piaget-Head battery, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure and the Wisconsin card classification test. The results showed slight/moderate deficits in practical-construction ability and mild defects of memory and concept abilities. In general the results supported the hypothesis tested. The mechanisms of superiority proposed in the classical hypothesis mainly involve the contralateral hemisphere: in this study the ipsilateral mechanism was more important.},

The results indicated that the structure of perceived multiple intelligences, which included the number and nature of dimensions, as well as the structural relationships among the 8 intelligences assessed, was largely similar for boys and girls. Subsequent second-order confirmatory factor analyses separately conducted for boys and for girls suggested that both boys and girls might perceive the 8 intelligences as falling into either the broad category of personal intelligences or one of the nonpersonal intelligences. Implications of the findings including subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual intelligences by boys and girls are discussed.},

Results showed that students were predominately high in the mastery goal orientation profile. Males had a higher comfort level with technology. Age was inversely related to comfort with technology. An unexpected finding was that grade point average was inversely related to comfort with use of technology. The data did not support the commonly held belief that today's students are uniformly well-skilled and comfortable with new technologies.

	abstract = {The main focus of this paper is an investigation, based partly on the results of a questionnaire circulated to a representative sample of participating primary teachers, of the experiential and holistic education practised by the Pushkin Trust, with particular reference to the impact of its work for children with special educational needs (SEN). The investigation is set against the theory of multiple intelligences expounded by Howard Gardner, and the ideas about different learning styles advocated by Kolb, and other educationalists. In thus tapping into and, in a sense, capitalising on important and innovative educational ideas and concepts, the work of the Pushkin Trust is seen to be an exciting, energising and innovative educational development in the Irish context, and with special significance for SEN teaching. The replies to the questionnaire highlight the educational benefits which the teachers felt the Pushkin Trust had provided their SEN pupils. These benefits, it is argued, are particularly valuable given the current emphasis on educational testing and on a standardised, prescriptive curriculum. © 2005, Educational Studies Association of Ireland.},

Design/methodology/ approach - Multiple measurement methodologies were used to conceptualize emotional, cognitive, and social intelligence. Subordinate ratings of three dimensions of transformational leadership were used as the criteria. Correlation analysis and a series of multiple hierarchical regressions were used to determine the relationship between the multiple intelligences and three dimensions of transformational leadership. Findings - Results indicate that a multiple intelligences framework is a useful approach to predict transformational leadership. Correlation analyses and multiple regression results indicated that the multiple intelligence framework explained between 10 and 25 percent of the variance in perceptions of transformational leadership and that assessment center dimensions explained additional variance beyond paper-and-pencil measures in transformational leadership. Originality/value - This paper extends previous research by examining the impact of cognitive, emotional, and social intelligences on transformational leadership using multiple measurement methodologies. The results of this study provide a useful framework for practitioners interested in assessing precursors to transformational leadership, with a focus on assessment centers as a useful tool for predicting transformational leadership.},

Thus, the teacher may verify, in objective form, the fulfillment of established in the program thanks to the use of diverse pedagogical means of education.

	abstract = {The study of intelligence must be approached through a retrospective view allowing it to be defined within the evolution of human thought. Three historical stages may be established: Empirical: it includes the ability of a person tu use his/her capacity in order to cope with the challenges of daily life; this is merely empiric and associated with the cultural environment of the group. Psychometric: it was defined at the end of the XIX century. Works like those of Galton, in 1877, who was the creator of the concept of correlation with which one could associate several psychological variables in terms of the individual differences, are highlighted. Pearson formalized the theory of correlation and permited, therefore, the prediction of psychological variables based on the knowledge of others. In 1904 Spearman made a significant contribution to the use of the method of correlation when the theory of the two factors of intelligence, general and specific, was published. Binet developed the concept of IQ and Catell developed the first test of intelligence based on 50 subtests of sensorial capacities. Multiple Intelligences: Guilford, in 1936 and Thurstone in 1946 sustained the existence of several factors or components of intelligence, and were first to approach the concept of multiple intelligence. Thorndike sustained that the quantitative measurement of intelligence involved several types of approaches, the abstract or verbal, the empirical and the social. At the beginning of the 70's Gardner sustained the thesis of the existence of a mental structure with multiple intelligence, mentioning seven different types. Intelligence has been conceptualized as an individual's overall ability to act rationally and successfully. However, it has been noted that a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is by no means a warranty leading to achieve prosperity, prestige, and success in life. This has brought about the classical intelligence construct being put into question. And also has lead to propose that there is not only a single form of intelligence but that there are several different types. This, in turn, has lead to re-categorize intelligence into a construct called emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is a construct which takes into account the individual's ability to monitor his/her own feelings and emotions and those of others, in order to discriminate between them and use this information as a guide for thoughts and actions. The evaluation of this construct poses a great difficulty because, even though there are some paradigmatic and scalar approaches, these are mainly directed towards work environment and used by organizational development advisors. In addition, the scales being used are short ones with a low validity content. Presently, there are no scalar instruments available in Mexico, to measure emotional intelligence. It was determined that our instrument will present a format of inventory, items formed by a statement that represents a feature of paradigmatic behavior of the emotional intelligence, with options to answer true or false. The inventory is formed by independent scale, which as a whole form a profile. The content of the instrument is based on three sources: The emotional abilities described by Gardner which are: capacity to cultivate relationships and maintain friendships, capacity to solve conflicts and dexterity for social analysis. The second source is described by Salovey: capacity to know and manage own emotions, to recognize emotions in others, and to manage interpersonal relationships. And finally, in the third place, we used the factors of the International Association for the Emotional Applied Intelligence. These include emotional control, self-esteem, control of impulses, handling of stress, social ability, handling of goals, automotivation and positive attitudes. The instrument which has been developed allows for emotional intelligence to be measured in eight scales in order to render a profile: impulse inhibition, empathy, optimism, social skills, emotional expression, achievement acknowledgement, self- esteem, and kindness. A non-probabilistic sample was used in a two-stage procedure including 723 individuals, between 16-80 years, where 49% of them were males and 50.8% females. Individuals involved gave their consent for the instrument to be applied. A validation and reliability procedure was carried out. The profile reached an alpha=0.95 internal consistency quotient. The eight aspects calculated by means of the factor analysis, through the main component method, and confirmed by structural analysis account for the 47.8% of common variance. The model was evaluated through a linear structural analysis using the AMOS V6.3 program. The following criteria were reached: X2(16) = 93.95; p<0.001, adjustment general fit index was AGFI=93% and root minimum square error adjusted was RMSEA=0.08. These values show a good adjustment. Another inter-scalar structural analysis considered impulse inhibition as the main scale in people's emotional intelligence. It was concluded that the Emotional Intelligence Profile was valid and reliable. Structural analysis carried out between profile scales shows a plausible pattern of QE previous and consequent features for emotional intelligence. The model obtained is non-recursive, this means that it presents closed trajectories. In other words, variables taken into account in evaluating the emotional intelligence construct feedback and potencialize one another. Each subscale refers to: a) Impulse inhibition: the ability that a person has to control impulsivity and to delay reinforcement; besides, it also is the ability to shift emotional states according with environment; b) Empathy, or the ability to identify self emotions and the feelings of others, and therefore to attain emotional agreement; c) Optimism, this is the positive attitude towards daily life, and it covers cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects; d) Social skills, this means the ability to learn new behaviors to adapt to the environment and to discriminate certain behaviors in specific situations, with the aim of adapting to society; e) Emotional expression, this is the ability to express emotional states in adequate situations; f) Achievement's acknowledgement, it's the cognitive ability to accept personal success and own well being, obtained along life; g) Self-esteem, in the traditional concept; it's the cognitive and emotional reasoning about self, from a critical angle; h) Kindness, it's a new construct which means the attitude of a person in the sense of preserving the well-being of others. The emotional intelligence profile will allow to study this concept considering several hypothesis, and, if it happens to be the case, to find specific profiles for different groups, mainly those characterized by mental health disturbances.},

Across different perspectives, logical‐mathematical intelligence received the highest ratings whereas bodily‐kinesthetic and naturalist intelligences received the lowest ratings. Based on the three profile similarity indices, elevation, scatter, and shape computed to describe each of the typical profiles of students, mothers, fathers, teachers, and peers, it was suggested that the mother perspective and the father perspective were more similar than those of teachers and peers. In addition, the indices also suggested the interpretation that mothers tended to be more sensitive to students’ multiple intelligences than fathers, teachers, and peers. Students’ perceived creativity and leadership were more predictable using the multiple intelligences from the student perspective. The implications of respecting multiple perspectives on students’ multiple intelligences for helping to meet the needs of gifted students are discussed. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Previous research suggested that males tend to give higher overall "g" estimates to their children and themselves than do females, as well as higher scores on mathematical and spatial intelligence (Furnham, 2001). Further, studies in the West suggest that parents think their children are significantly brighter than they are and that their sons are brighter than their daughters. Estimates were lower than those found in Western populations but, even so, males rated their own mathematical and spatial intelligence higher than did females. Hong Kong Chinese parents did not think their sons were brighter than their daughters. The seven multiple intelligences factored into three clear factors for self and children, and regressions indicated that it was "academic" intelligence (verbal, mathematical, spatial) that was most "g" loaded. The child's age and the self-rated overall IQ of both the parents were the best predictors of the child's overall estimated IQ. Less than a third of the parents had taken an IQ test or believed they measured IQ very well. Those who were more likely to be better educated, had taken an IQ test, and believed intelligence was inherited were more likely to award themselves higher overall IQ scores. Results are compared with the British studies in the same area.},

Julie Roberts had used a learning preferences profiling technique in which students are asked to complete a brief questionnaire based on multiple intelligences categories. The results are then used to indicate the students’ most preferred and least preferred learning approaches. Julie found that this generated dialogue and reflection about teaching and learning in her classroom. Subsequent collaboration with the other schools within a school improvement network in Hertfordshire led to a larger-scale project in which teacher-coordinators met to share practice and to shape the process. The university Faculty of Education provided support in the form of a researcher who visited the schools to gather data about the process of learning preferences profiling and its effect. The data were analysed and used by project coordinators in the schools to evaluate the process. The article sets the project in context and then draws on a narrative about the project’s development to show how the impact ofteacher research can be enhanced through different layers of collaboration and strategic teacher leadership. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This article describes an integrated phonics and literature-based approach to developing children's emergent literacy skills. These skills included alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, phonics and nonsense word competence, and language usage. Using Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligence, the program's literacy activities addressed children's interpersonal, intrapersonal, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, musical, naturalistic, and visual-spatial abilities and interests. Stories from children's trade books were told in a variety of storytelling methods, such as draw talk, character imagery, felt board, group role play, and chant. These approaches were matched to children's interests and multiple intelligence areas. All of the storytelling sessions were followed by related activities that incorporated the children's emergent literacy skills. Results from this study of 13 inner-city children indicated that this integrated, seven-week program resulted in significant gains in phonemic awareness, nonsense word competence, and word usage fluency. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) was used as a pretest and a posttest to assess children's initial and later competence on the basic emergent literacy skills. Implications for further research on this integrated approach are discussed. © 2006 by the Association for Childhood Education International.},

Data from Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996) were reanalyzed using CFA. I analyzed several models based on the theoretical conceptualization of the authors, their exploratory factor analysis, and the subsequent reanalysis of the data by Pyryt (2000). Models that allowed for intercorrelations among factors fit better than those without such correlations. Although the performance tasks appeared to measure their constructs as predicted, a model with three factors that combined Linguistic and Interpersonal Intelligence, rather than the four original factors, was supported. Higher order models indicated the presence of a general factor underlying the multiple intelligences. Although not conforming exactly to the original theory, it appears that this set of performance tasks is a step in the right direction in terms of measuring multiple intelligences. Pyryt's concern for the influence of g was confirmed to some extent, but it appears that both factors and individual tasks retain sufficient variance to allow for the interpretation that they measure separate abilities.},

We argue that mainstream education is constructed on a flawed notion of intelligence and consequently disables many learners, perhaps even the majority of them. In this context, we suggest that approaches common in special education have a wider application in mainstream education than is generally supposed. This is particularly true from the perspective that students in mainstream education are multiply intelligent. Inclusive educators have suggested that special education approaches have merit in non-special education environments. For those who work in mainstream education, however, special education approaches, insofar as they are thought of at all, are thought of as deficit approaches. We propose that insights from a combination of the theory of multiple intelligences and special education perspectives can reformulate mainstream education to begin to respond effectively to the diverse needs of all learners. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {These are exciting times for training as technology allows us to understand how the brain learns and functions. Research confirms our belief that we have the ability to learn throughout our lives, reinforcing the concept of lifelong learning. This has important implications for the mental and physical health of the aging population, and becomes an important reality for managing a lifetime of health and happiness. It has equal importance for training to ensure the use of strategies that allow all learners to be successful. The knowledge we now have on how the brain learns provides us with a unique opportunity to re-examine our training methods to ensure that we embrace brain-based learning, multiple intelligence and emotional intelligence. This will bring to the training environment an attitude that provides a true understanding, empathy, tolerance and respect for all learners, creating optimum learning environments.},

	abstract = {Significant advances have been made in understanding the neurophysiological basis of learning, including the discovery of mirror neurons and the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responsive element binding (CREB) protein in learning. Mirror neurons help us visually compare an observed activity with a remembered action in our memory, an ability that helps us imitate and learn through watching. Long-term potentiation, the Hebb rule, and CREB protein are associated with the formation of long-term memories. Conversely, protein phosphatase 1 and glucocorticoids are neurophysiological phenomena that limit what can be learned and cause forgetfulness. Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences contends that different areas of the brain are responsible for different competencies that we all possess to varying degrees. These multiple intelligences can be used as strategies for improved learning. Repeating material, using mnemonics, and avoiding overwhelming stress are other strategies for improving learning. Imaging studies have shown that practice with resultant learning results in significantly less use of brain areas, indicating that the brain becomes more efficient. Experts have advantages over novices, including increased cognitive processing efficiency. Nurses are in a unique position to use their understanding of neurophysiological principles to implement better educational strategies to provide quality education to patients and others. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

Despite extensive recognition of the importance of information literacy in education and learning, its importance in the school curriculum has not yet been fully recognized. This paper discusses the importance of information literacy and the major standards and guidelines that have shaped its implementation in the school curriculum. Traditional methods of teaching information literacy through directed instruction, and sporadic or discrete school library workshops, have not been very successful in entrenching the necessary skills. This paper proposes a dynamic information literacy pedagogy that identifies and harnesses learners' interests (in this case, with the use of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences). By identifying students' dominant intelligences and thus their abilities, it can help ignite their interest in learning something new and unfamiliar. This in turn, can bring about a more effective erudition and prolonged retention of information literacy skills amongst learners. An introduction to an on-going experimental-action study that utilises this approach within the context of secondary school students (aged 14-15 years old) is also presented.},

	abstract = {Learning characteristics, as informed by research, vary for each individual learner. Research suggests that knowledge is processed and represented in different ways and that students prefer to use different types of resources in distinct ways. However, building Adaptive Educational systems that adapt to different learning characteristics is not easy. Major research questions exist such as: how are the relevant learning characteristics identified, how does modelling of the learner take place and in what way should the learning environment change for users with different learning characteristics? EDUCE is one system that addresses these challenges by using Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as the basis for dynamically modelling learning characteristics and for designing instructional material. This paper describes a research study, using EDUCE, that explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies and the impact on learning performance when material is matched and mismatched with learning preferences. The results suggest that students with low levels of learning activity, and who use only a limited number of the resources available, have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies and that surprisingly learning gain increases when they are provided with resources not normally preferred. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper attempts to do three things. Firstly, in the light of growing concern over the expanding managerialism and rationalism within society in general and accounting education in particular, the paper presents a theoretical reappraisal of the extent to which conventional perspectives on rationalism and managerialism might be misconstrued. In particular, the paper address a question that relates to the role of emotion within business decision making: 'while we might feel uneasy about basing accounting and business decisions purely on reason, surely this is more acceptable than basing them on feelings or emotions?' Behind this rhetorical question lies the common assumption that emotional responses to business issues are at best unhelpful. The first section of the paper explores this misconceived notion of the distinction between reason and emotion which, it is argued, has emerged primarily from the work of Max Weber and presents an alternative perspective on the primacy of emotion in all rational decision making. Secondly, drawing on Gardner's work on multiple intelligences, the paper suggests that the conventional misconception of the relationship between emotion and reason has resulted in the complete failure within accounting education to address the area of student's emotional intelligence. Finally, it is contended that despite the spread of managerialism, accounting education remains a dialectical process and the paper concludes with a report on a specific attempt to critically resist the managerialist rhetoric through developing accounting student's emotional skills. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There were three groups of participants: 285 (149 female, 136 male) pupils of a mixed government-run comprehensive school, between the ages of 13 and 16 years; 93 mothers and 58 fathers of the pupils; and five female and eight male teachers. Children estimated their own and their parents' IQ, whilst the parents estimated their own and their children's IQ; the teachers estimated only the children's intelligence. The aims of this study were firstly to assess whether perceptions of male intellectual superiority were observable in school age children and school teachers, and to make direct comparisons between the children's self-estimations and those of the parents and the teachers. Secondly, this study aimed to replicate previous literature on adult self-estimations of overall and multiple intelligences, and to compare these to estimations by children of these adults (their parents). Fewer sex differences were observed than expected. Teachers' estimations did not follow conceptions of male superiority. The patterns of sex differences in mother and teacher estimations of children were similar to each other, as were those of fathers and children. Verbal and numerical abilities were found to be most closely related to estimations of overall IQ in all three groups. Most striking was the lack of correlation between father and daughter estimations of each other. Reasons why this study failed to replicate findings on adult samples are discussed.

This study investigated eight and nine year old children's capabilities to develop skills in the intrapersonal intelligence domain as defined by Howard Gardner. A group of twenty-seven students identified as low achievers in English were introduced to a program specifically designed to foster their self-knowledge as learners and establish how this self-knowledge may be used to improve their self-management skills in the English learning environment. The results obtained evidenced a considerable improvement in the students' self knowledge and attested to how this impacted on their perceptions of themselves as learners and their behaviours in the learning context. The students grew increasingly aware of their own relative strengths and used this information to negotiate their learning environment, to identify strategies that worked for them and to take increasingly more responsibility for their own learnings.},

The stability of all the assessed factors is also analysed. A training program was implemented to increase IS. A quantitative analysis clearly shows the improvement experienced by the 34 older people (low in IS) whose performance after training reached the level of 68 older people who were considered normal. The qualitative analysis highlights a temporal consideration of responses given to two items of IS: causal attribution and predicting consequences. The theoretical, methodological, and procedural aspects are based on the general personality model developed by Pelechano in Spain, including a model of multiple intelligences. © Rev. Int. Psicol.

	abstract = {Pedagogical practices based on Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences (MI) are often cited as potentially facilitative of inclusion of students with developmental disabilities (Armstrong, 1994; Eichinger & Downing, 1996; Falvey, Givner, & Kimm, 1996). However, no research to date has examined this relationship. The purpose of this study was to examine the engaged behavior and social interactions of 10 students with developmental disabilities in two types of inclusive classrooms–those that ascribed to MI pedagogy, instruction, and assessment, and those that used no specific educational theory or approach to instruction. The study was intended to be exploratory in nature to generate hypotheses for future investigations. Data were collected using MS-CISSAR (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, & Delquadri, 1997), a software program for gathering and analyzing observational data in classrooms. Results suggested that the experiences of the participants in both typical and MI-inclusive classrooms were more alike than different. Participants in both types of classrooms were engaged primarily in whole-class, independent seatwork, and traditional classroom activities, and were engaged less frequently in small groups or multiple response activities. However, participants were observed more frequently to be engaged in multiple response activities in MI classrooms, and in both noninstructional time and individual seatwork activities that were different from those of peers in typical classrooms. The participants in MI classrooms spent more time interacting with their typical peers, whereas those in typical classrooms spent more time interacting with adults during 1:1 activities that were different from those of their peers. The results are discussed in terms of their educational and research implications, limitations, and suggestions for further research. © 2002, TASH. All rights reserved.},

The experimental group was instructed through Multiple Intelligence strategies while the control group employed traditional methods. The assessment tools were the Diversity of Living Things Concepts Test (DLTCT) and the Teele Inventory of Multiple Intelligences (TIMI). Before treatment, no statistically significant difference between the groups was found in terms of understanding of diversity of living things concepts. After treatment, independent t-test analysis indicated that MII produced significantly greater achievement in the understanding of diversity of living things concepts (p<0.05) and on students' retention of knowledge (p<0.05). The results of TIMI revealed that fourth grade students' most dominant intelligence was logical-mathematical intelligence both before and after treatment.

	abstract = {The aim is to study the psycho-pedagogical roots of the Multiple Intelligences model. Then we analyse the data obtained in our empirical study carried out with 294 students (preschool and primary school levels). In 1983 Gardner publishes his book Frames of Mind. The theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI), whose aim is to prove the existence of eight intelligences (linguistic, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, corporal-kinetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalistic). Later, he publishes the Spectrum Project, based on the Multiple Intelligences Theory (Gardner et al, 1998 a, b and c). The aim of Spectrum is to design a procedure to evaluate the cognitive competence of children of early childhood. The psychopedagogical roots of Spectrum are those of the authors of the New School: Dewey, Montessori and Decroly. From the Spectrum, the evaluation of cognitive competence is centred on the individual and the classroom is a pedagogical laboratory where children are «learning by doing» (Dewey, 1899, 1906); work is organised in learning centres according to the interests and abilities of the students (Montessori, 1912); four main principles for education are highlighted: freedom, individualisation, activity and globalisation of teaching (Dewey, 1910; Decroly, 1929). The results show the existence of seven independent constructs that fit with six intelligences evaluated and established by Gardner (1983); and that the learning center is a good procedure to teach children the knowledge, skills and attitudes implicit in the different intelligences, participating in a cooperative way.},

The other goal is to test the instrument as a self-assessment tool to evaluate one’s spiritual sensitivity, the eighth spiritual intelligence dimension. Bayesian network modeling was used to study statistical dependencies between variables. Alpha values were calculated for the eight MI scales operationalized by seven dimensions for the first seven MI scales and four dimensions for the eighth spiritual intelligence scale. The results suggest that “bodily-kinesthetic” and “interpersonal” dimensions emphasizes the operational and social aspects of peacekeepers’ intelligences. The theoretical model of spiritual intelligence does not operate at its optimal level with this sample. Practical implications of this study point out possibilities for peacekeeper candidates to self-evaluate their gifts and talents relevant to peacekeeping mission. © 2005, © 2005 — World Council for Gifted and Talented Children.

EDUCE is an Intelligent Tutoring System for which a set of learning resources has been developed using the principles of Multiple Intelligences. It can dynamically identify user learning characteristics and adaptively provide a customised learning material tailored to the learner. This paper introduces the predictive engine used within EDUCE. It describes the input representation model and the learning mechanism employed. The input representation model consists of input features that describe how different resources were used and inferred from fine-grained information collected during student computer interactions. The predictive engine employs the Naive Bayes classifier and operates online using no prior information. Using data from a previous experimental study, a comparison was made between the performance of the predictive engine and the actual behaviour of a group of students using the learning material without any guidance from EDUCE. Results indicate correlation between student's behaviour and the predictions made by EDUCE. These results suggest that the concept of learning characteristics can be modelled using a learning scheme with appropriately chosen attributes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

While there were no gender or age group differences, arts/music/sports teachers indicated greater strengths in musical intelligence when compared with language and social studies teachers, and guidance teachers indicated greater strengths in both intrapersonal intelligence and interpersonal intelligence than did non-guidance teachers. Using the eight intelligences as predictors, teachers' interpersonal intelligence was the significant predictor of their self-efficacy in helping others.

The subjects were divided into two groups: control and experimental. The control group took only the regular practical arts lessons, while the experimental group took the additional lessons of this program. The results were as followed. First, the food preferences of the experimental group increased for various foods, expecially fish, beans, vegetables, and seaweed, for which their preferences had been low, while their preferences for processed foodstuffs decreased. Second, the eating behavior of the experimental group improved more than that of the control group. Thus, this program had positive effects on the children's food preferences and eating behavior. Programs such as these can help children to participate in learning activities with greater interest, and to learn various subjects in books.

The latter focus is on the nearly 20 published papers on estimated intelligence. Studies have shown consistent sex differences with males rating themselves higher than females. There are also consistent generational effects with adult participants believing around a half standard deviation difference in intelligence with their grandparents being least intelligent and children most. Self-estimated and psychometric intelligence only correlates weakly. Studies looking at self and other estimates of multiple intelligence indicated that participants seemed to believe that intelligence was male normative in that it was specifically those types of intelligence (mathematical and spatial) that most differentiated between the sexes that were themselves more predictive of general overall intelligence. Implications of these findings for intelligence testing are considered. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The sample consisted of 257 Navajo Indian and Mexican-American participants from kindergarten, 2nd, 4th, and 5th grades. Interrater correlations were performed to assess whether observers had given students similar or different ratings in the five activities of the assessment: Pabio® (spatial), Tangrams (spatial/logical-mathematical), Math, Storytelling, and Storywriting (linguistic). The results showed low and nonsignificant interrating correlations, indicating that students identified as gifted in one intelligence were not necessarily rated highly in the other intelligences, a finding congruent with the theory of multiple intelligences. On the other hand, the results gave rise to many validity concerns. The author recommends further studies before calling for the use of the DISCOVER assessment on a wider scale.

	abstract = {The main goals of this article are to explain how the theory of the motivated mind conceptualizes the productive interaction of intelligence, creativity, and achievement motivation and to show how this theory can help educators to maximize students' emergent potential for giftedness. According to this theory, students' motivated minds are complex‐adaptive systems comprised of two co‐evolving psychological subsystems: cold‐order thinking expressed as serious intelligence and hot‐chaotic thinking expressed as fun creativity. When these co‐evolving subsystems become fully differentiated and integrated, students' complex capacity for giftedness emerges as fluid‐adaptive thinking. This enhanced thinking capacity is both seriously intelligent and playfully creative at the same time. Students' optimal motivation for self‐regulating and educators’ ideal leadership style for promoting fluid‐adaptive thinking are operationally described. The motivated mind is also compared and contrasted with Renzulli's three rings of giftedness, Gardner's multiple intelligences, Stemberg's successful intelligence, and Csikszentmihalyi's optimal experience of flow. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This paper further substantiates these concerns by exploring the emotional nature of rationality and unconscious ways of knowing (implicit memory) from the field of neurobiology and psychology and offers a physiological explanation of the interdependent relationship of emotion and reason and the role of implicit memory in transformative learning theory. Recent research not only provides support that emotions can affect the processes of reason, but more importantly, emotions have been found to be indispensable for rationality to occur. Furthermore, brain research brings to light new insights about a form of long-term memory that has long been overlooked, that of implicit memory, which receives, stores, and recovers outside the conscious awareness of the individual. From implicit memory emerges habits, attitudes and preferences inaccessible to conscious recollection but these are nonetheless shapes by former events, influence our present behaviour, and are an essential part of who we are. Finally, based on these new insights for fostering transformative learning is discussed, revealing the need to include practices inclusive of ‘other ways of knowing,’ and more specifically, from the study of emotional literacy and multiple intelligences. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In studying the case, a variety of data sources and methods were used, including audiotaped planning meetings and interviews, classroom observations, teacher‐generated concept maps, and reflective journals.This article describes Jade's initial explorations of the theory, how she incorporated the theory into her daily teaching, and the outcomes of the study for Jade and her students.

Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.] seven primary mental abilities (verbal fluency, verbal comprehension, numerical ability, spatial visualization, memory, perceptual speed and reasoning) and four additional types of intelligence proposed by Gardner [Gardner, G. (1983). Frames of mind: The theory of multiple intelligences. New York: Basic Books.], namely musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. Gender differences were identified for only some of the intelligence domains. Males rated their mathematical, logical and spatial intelligence higher than females, while females gave higher scores than males for musical and interpersonal intelligence. Furthermore, there was some direct evidence for the assumption that estimates of intelligence are susceptible to gender stereotypes. When controlling for gender stereotypes, sex-related differences in self-estimated types of intelligence were confined to mathematical abilities and memory with higher ratings of males in the former and higher ratings of females in the latter one. Finally, factor analyses suggested gender differences in the conceptualization of some aspects of intelligence. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This essay explores some of these implications and the somewhat incomplete attempts ('emotional intelligence' and 'multiple intelligences') to translate them into educational practice. It is argued that proposals about the teaching of emotional virtue in schools typically come up against a wall of 'myths' concerning the futility, if not the downright danger, of moral education in general and emotion education in particular. An attempt is made to dismantle some of these myths, paving the way for a more optimistic 'post-Kohlbergian' approach. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {A general theory of signs shows a deep logical dependency of nonverbal/performance tests on conventional linguistic signs. Two hypotheses follow • Hypothesis 1: To the extent that nonverbal abilities can be measured, they must be positively correlated with primary language abilities • Hypothesis 2: (a) In the early stages of acquiring a second or foreign language, proficiencies in the primary (stronger or native) language should correlate more strongly with nonverbal abilities than proficiencies in the nonprimary (weaker, second or foreign) language; and (b) As persons approach greater parity between their primary and any non-primary language, correlations between nonverbal scores and proficiencies in the two languages should both be significantly positive, and should approach equality. By contrast, the Cattell-Horn theory (Horn and Cattell, 1996; Horn, 1988) predicts about the same level of correlation throughout the course of development and Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1993) predicts that distinct intelligences should be uncorrelated. All three theories can be tested by examining the simple correlations of language proficiency measures with nonverbal IQ scores in intermediate and advanced nonprimary language learners. © 2000, Sage Publications.

	abstract = {Objective: The objectives of this study were to examine common patterns in the lives and artwork of five artistic savants previously described and to report on the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging findings from one newly diagnosed artistic savant. Background: The artistic savant syndrome has been recognized for centuries, although its neuroanatomic basis remains a mystery. Methods: The cardinal features, strengths, and weaknesses of the work of these six savants were analyzed and compared with those of children with autism in whom artistic talent was absent. An anatomic substrate for these behaviors was considered in the context of newly emerging theories related to paradoxical functional facilitation, visual thinking, and multiple intelligences. Results: The artists had features of 'pervasive developmental disorder' including impairment in social interaction and communication as well as restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interest, and activities. All six demonstrated a strong preference for a single art medium and showed a restricted variation in artistic themes. None understood art theory. Some autistic features contributed to their success, including attention to visual detail, a tendency toward ritualistic compulsive repetition, the ability to focus on one topic at the expense of other interests, and intact memory and visuospatial skills. Conclusions: The artistic savant syndrome remains rare and mysterious in origin. Savants exhibit extraordinary visual talents along with profound linguistic and social impairment. The intense focus on and ability to remember visual detail contributes to the artistic product of the savant. The anatomic substrate for the savant syndrome may involve loss of function in the left temporal lobe with enhanced function of the posterior neocortex.},

Parents estimated that their sons had significantly higher IQs than their daughters (115.21 vs. 107.49). Self-estimates and estimates of children's multiple intelligences were higher for men and sons, significantly so for logical-mathematical and spatial intelligence. Parents rated 2nd-born daughters as having significantly higher verbal and musical intelligence than their male counterparts. Higher parental IQ self-estimates corresponded with higher IQ estimates for children. Results for 1st-born children were clearest and showed the most significant differences.

This article discusses the effects on pupils’ learning of using Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. It is based on explorations carried out in a project ‘using multiple intelligences in the classroom’, initiated by co-ordinators Brenda Hopper, Val Chamberlain and Barbara Jack in the School of Education at Edge Hill College of Higher Education. The project aimed to focus equally on teachers’ individual professional development, and the learning experiences and development of the pupils involved, and was carried out with teachers in local primary and secondary schools, across a wide range of subjects. © NAPCE 2000.},

Over 600 students from New Zealand completed a brief questionnaire based on those used in previous research (Furnham, 2001). Three of the ten self-estimates yielded significant sex differences. Males believed they were more intelligent than females on mathematical (logical), spatial and existential intelligence. Those who had previously completed an IQ test gave higher self-estimates on eight of the ten estimates. Self-estimates were compared to university samples from America and Britain, and results tended to show New Zealand students gave lower self-estimates particularly on mathematical, body-kinetic, existential, spiritual and naturalistic intelligence. Factor analysis showed the ten multiple intelligences fell into three interpretable factors which were predicted by both gender and test experience.},

The author provides examples of reflection on evolving theories of education that may help students' metacognition with regard to their own learning and the learning of others. As specific examples of this claim, Gardner's theories of multiple intelligences and entry points are explored as authentic topics for classroom learning. Suggesting and reviewing art-related metacognitive activities that engage inquiry, access, and reflection, the paper draws from research led by the author in Project Museums Uniting with Schools in Education (MUSE).},

The theory was used as a framework to make decisions about how he would structure learning experiences for his grade nine students in a science unit on space and astronomy. Through participation in the project, Dave believed he was able to offer his students a more student-centered, engaging science curriculum that catered to individual learning needs. Thus, the case provides insight into the nature of MI theory and how the framework of MI theory can be used to make science accessible to students and to assist them in achieving high levels of scientific literacy. 2001 School Science and Mathematics Association.},

A Sex × Culture ANOVA on the three factors that underlie the seven intelligence types (verbal, numerical, cultural) showed consistent culture and many sex effects, but no interactions. Male participants rated their own overall IQ and that of their fathers, but not their mothers and sisters, higher than did female participants as predicted. Male participants also rated their numerical IQ, but not verbal or cultural IQ, higher than females. There were consistent and clear culture differences. The Americans rated their multiple IQ scores higher than the Japanese (around 6-10 points) with the British intermediate between the two. All participants rated their fathers' (and brothers') numerical IQ higher, and verbal IQ lower, than their mothers' and sisters', as found previously. Overall results showed consistency in the sex differences in ratings across cultures but differences in level of estimated IQ, possibly as a result of cultural demands for modesty. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.
