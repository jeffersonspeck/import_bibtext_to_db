  abstract={ In his book, Five Minds for the Future (2006), Howard Gardner offers both a constructive critique of current educational practices and an alternative vision for the future of education. Gardner, best known for his seminal work on multiple intelligences, grounds his major conclusions primarily on the results of his impressive, decade-long, and massive Good Works Project. Despite my several agreements and significant overlap with Howard Gardner, I believe that there is insufficient evidence to accept fully his policy prescriptions. Gardner’s selection of the five minds of the future – the disciplined, synthesizing, creating, respectful, and ethical minds – is based on a set of limiting assumptions concerning globalization, good work, individuality, power and control, disciplines as value-free enterprises, ethics as the point of view of the universe, and the completeness of his list. This paper suggests that our conception of education might be dramatically expanded to include a more critical and distanced stance towards: globalization, the current goals of business, individualism, the traditional disciplines, and even ethics than Gardner currently imagines. Its aims can and should be broadened to include not only good work, but also love and play. Students must learn how to control their environments, but also how to appreciate and accept life’s inevitable difficulties and limits. Ethics should certainly play a more central role in education as Gardner correctly emphasizes, but our understanding of ethics must include not only respect but also care; not only principles but also dialog. To accomplish all of this, however, requires us to think beyond Gardner’s five minds to include additional “mental dispositions” like the caring, critical, intersubjective, spiritual, and joyful minds. Each of these “minds” is explored in this paper. },

Research by O’Brien (Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligence and its implications for the counselling of children. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, 1999) revealed that by drawing on a combination of preferred intelligences, children were able to enhance the dialogue between the unconscious and conscious, while strengthening the relationship between the counsellor and client. A number of useful counselling approaches are highlighted in working with children, particularly younger children who have not yet developed language sufficient for more formal counselling sessions. Suggestions that assist counsellors to operate across settings are explored. },

  abstract={ The present paper thoroughly examines how one can effectively bridge in-school and out-of-school learning. The first part discusses the difficulty in defining out-of-school learning. It proposes to distinguish three types of learning: formal, informal, and non-formal. The second part raises the question of whether out-of-school learning should be dealt with in the in-school system, in view of the fact that we experience informal learning anyway as well as considering the disadvantages and difficulties teachers are confronted with when planning and carrying out scientific fieldtrips. The voices of the teachers, the students, and the non-formal institution staff are heard to provide insights into the problem. The third part discusses the cognitive and affective aspects of non-formal learning. The fourth part presents some models explaining scientific fieldtrip learning and based on those models, suggests a novel explanation. The fifth part offers some recommendations of how to bridge in and out-of-school learning. The paper closes with some practical ideas as to how one can bring the theory described in the paper into practice. It is hoped that this paper will provide educators with an insight so that they will be able to fully exploit the great potential that scientific field trips may offer. },

Personality and Individual Differences 30:857–871, 2001), a measure of Approaches to Learning Styles (Biggs 1987), a measure of the Big Five personality traits (Costa and McCrae 1992), as well as gave their own estimated scores on the Gardner (1999) multiple intelligences. Alpha co-efficients were modest with only three of the eight test-derived, multiple intelligence scores being over .70. ‘Linguistic’ and Mathematical intelligence alone were correlated with General Knowledge. Five of the eight ‘intelligences’ were correlated both with Extraversion and Openness. Regressions indicated that ‘Intrapersonal intelligence’ was closely linked with Stability and Conscientiousness; ‘Interpersonal intelligence’ with Extraversion; ‘Linguistic intelligence’ with Openness; ‘Mathematical intelligence’ with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Correlations between self-estimated and test-derived emotional intelligence showed correlations ranging from r = .18 to r = .56 for similar type ‘intelligences’. This study provides modest evidence for the concurrent and construct validity of this measure. It requires more psychometric evidence of validity before it is used. },

This paper presents the theoretical foundations of cognitive robots based on the latest advances in abstract intelligence, cognitive informatics, and denotational mathematics. A formal model of intelligence known as the Generic Abstract Intelligence Mode (GAIM) is developed, which provides a foundation to explain the mechanisms of advanced natural intelligence such as thinking, learning, and inference. A set of denotational mathematics is introduced for rigorously modeling and manipulating the behaviors of cognitive robots. A case study on applications of a denotational mathematics, visual semantic algebra (VSA), is presented in architectural and behavioral modeling of cognitive robots based on the theory of abstract intelligence. },

Some adaptations have included exploring learning styles, designing lesson plans, developing integrated curricula, and adopting authentic forms of assessment. In this case study, a high school science teacher, Jade (a pseudonym), explored MI theory and used it as a conceptual framework to make decisions about how to structure her Grade 9 science curriculum. In studying the case, a variety of data sources and methods were used, including audiotaped planning meetings and interviews, classroom observations, teacher-generated concept maps, and reflective journals. This article describes Jade’s initial explorations of the theory, how she incorporated the theory into her daily teaching, and the outcomes of the study for Jade and her students. In addition, tensions and challenges experienced by Jade in applying the theory to practice and the implications for science teaching and learning are discussed. },

The literature regarding such diverse topics, and the literature regarding “professional success” is extensive and wide-ranging, crossing educational, psychological, business, medical and vocational fields of study. This review is designed to introduce ways of viewing nontechnical competence from the psychology of human capacity to current perspectives, initiatives and needs in practice. After an introduction to the tensions inherent in educating individuals for both biomedical competency and “bedside” or “cageside” manner, the paper presents a brief overview of the major lines of inquiry into intelligence theory and how theories of multiple intelligences can build a foundation for conceptualizing professional and life skills. The discussion then moves from broad concepts of intelligence to more specific workplace skill sets, with an emphasis on professional medical education. This section introduces the research on noncognitive variables in various disciplines, the growing emphasis on competency based education, and the SKA movement in veterinary education. The next section presents the evidence that nontechnical, noncognitive or humanistic skills influence achievement in academic settings, medical education and clinical performance, as well as the challenges faced when educational priorities must be made. },

Considering that EI can be a potential determinant of our achievement in working life, this study aims to determine if there is any significant difference in the EI of local and foreign undergraduates studying in universities in Singapore. The “Emotional IQ Test” was administered to 100 undergraduates from various fields of studies from the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, of which 31 had foreign education background. This study showed that foreign undergraduates have a higher EI score than those with local education background. In addition, by examining the relationships between variables such as age, gender, year of study and EI, it was found that males have higher EI scores than that of females. The implication for managers is that staff should be evaluated on their own merits such as their EI rather than on academic results. },

  abstract={ From some perspectives, it seems obvious that emotions and feelings must be both reasonable and morally significant: from others, it may seem as obvious that they cannot be. This paper seeks to advance discussion of ethical implications of the currently contested issue of the relationship of reason to feeling and emotion via reflection upon various examples of affectively charged moral dilemma. This discussion also proceeds by way of critical consideration of recent empirical enquiry into these issues in the literature of so-called ‘emotional intelligence’. In this regard, despite ambiguities in their accounts of the relationship of reason to emotion, advocates of emotional intelligence generally incline to therapeutic conceptions of emotional health which are not inconsistent with currently fashionable ‘cognitivist’ accounts of feeling and emotion. All the same, it is arguable that therapeutic or other strategies which overplay the possibility of cognitive or other resolution of emotional conflict are prey to certain difficulties. First, they underemphasise those passive but identity-constitutive aspects of affect which are not obviously rationally accountable. Secondly, they insufficiently recognise the extent to which emotional conflicts can be significantly implicated in moral diversity. In view of either or both of these points, they may fail to appreciate the moral inappropriateness of attempts to resolve certain forms of emotional conflict or tension. },

  abstract={ Education in this 21st century is concerned with developing intelligences. Problem solving in real-world contexts involves multiple ways of knowing and learning. Intelligence in the real world involves not only learning how to do things effectively but also more importantly the ability to deal with novelty and growing our capacity to adapt, select and shape our interactions with the environment. Knowledge in this new millennium is increasingly characterized by the creative integration of information and learning from diverse disciplines. Educators, policy makers and researchers need to be aware of new approaches of dealing with knowledge and information where problems can be used innovatively in pedagogies. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an inquiry-based pedagogy that is best rooted in sound understanding of the psychological processes of problem solving and the development of cognition. Whilst many educators support the need to develop multiple intelligences, few realize that one of the best ways to draw forth these intelligences is to understand the psychology of using real world problem scenarios and engaging inquiry. This paper addresses the state-of-the-art of PBL along three themes. The first is the psychology of cognition, metacognition, and self-regulation in problem-based pedagogies. The second is the idea of making thinking and mind visible through dialogue and inquiry. The third theme is the use of learning environments beyond the boundaries of the classroom to enhance problem-based thinking. Finally, the implications for educational innovation and practices are discussed. },

The population for this study included approximately 11,653 third-grade students from 99 public elementary schools. Subjects were randomly selected from 16 out of 99 elementary schools. TheMilne- Kasen Story Pictures (A Test for Creativity), theYoung Visual Artist’s Checklist, thePortfolio Review Measurement, the classroom teacher’s nomination ofMilne- Kasen Visual/Spatial Intelligence Checklist were given to 427 selected students. Data were processed, analyzed, and reported using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings revealed that positive relationships exist between a child’s creativity potential and self-image of artistic ability and local art educators’ observations of students’ artwork and classroom teachers’ observations of student’s art-related behaviors. There were significant differences in responses based upon the demographic factors of gender, community, age, and time of test taking. These findings should impact the delivery of art education to children at the elementary school level. In addition, it might influence the development of the art education curriculum in Taiwan. },

  abstract={ Today's out-of-school learning is dominated by PC games, videos, and TV. These media provide children with optimal conditions for nurturing their visuospatial intelligence. In chemistry and biochemistry, over the past 125 years, thinking has shifted from the logical–mathematical to the logical–visuospatial. In chemistry visuospatial thinking has never been so dominant as today. Thus in chemistry, a truly international, pictorial language has evolved. Yet, the founding and growth of chemical education as a separate discipline has resulted, albeit unintended, in an alienation of chemistry educators from these dramatic changes in chemistry. By confining themselves in their teaching of chemistry to the logical–mathematical and the verbal, teachers and chemical educators are conveying a false and abandoned conception of chemistry in the class rooms. And, they fail to address the most important developed intelligence of our young. },

  abstract={ Emotional intelligence (EI) has been an emerging topic for psychological, educational, and management researchers and consultants in recent years. Unfortunately, there have been relatively few empirical studies on EI conducted with scientific rigor, especially in Asia. A recent study clarified the definition of EI as a set of mental abilities related to emotions, and developed a self-report EI measure by demonstrating the relationships between EI and life satisfaction, job performance, and job satisfaction for Chinese respondents. To facilitate future EI research and EI-related human resource practices in Asia, we develop an alternative EI measure in this series of four studies using forced choice items. Scenarios with alternative responses showing different levels of EI were generated in the first study, and 20 items were selected empirically. In the second study, pairs of abilities were generated and 20 EI items were paired with various ability facets. In the third study, we examined the social desirability of the 40 items developed in the first two studies. In the fourth study, these 40 EI items were cross-validated. The results indicated that this forced choice EI-scale had acceptable convergent, discriminant and predictive validity using life satisfaction, job performance, and job satisfaction as criterion variables. We discussed the implications of our findings in the conclusion. },

  abstract={ This paper focuses on the issue of separate schooling. Diverse societies use schools to develop shared value systems, strengthen democratic engagements and provide better educational outcomes. However, in Europe, the United States, Australia and elsewhere groups of parents and communities have been invoking human rights claims to challenge the state, often successfully, to demand separate schools for their children or the right to send their children to a school of their choosing, irrespective of the consequences for society at large. Yet do such separate schools reflect an increased respect for the rights of minorities and a commitment to help them reach their full potential? Do they help remove marginalization and can they ever lead to the establishment of stable and peaceable communities? Or do they undermine societal commitments to intergroup harmony and perpetuate stereotypes, racism and ethnocentric thinking? Do they keep existing inequalities in place and deny young people the opportunities they need to become full-fledged members of society? It is argued here that regardless of location, separate schools are part of the problem, not the solution. },

  abstract={ In this paper we test the hypothesis that landscape changes in a region of Northern Portugal (Minho) in the last 40 years could be predicted from socioeconomic and political history. The major predicted changes were related to agricultural abandonment and afforestation. We further predicted that these changes contributed to increased fire risk. Analysis of aerial photography for the years 1958, 1968, 1983 and 1995 in a study area of 3700&nbsp;ha revealed a significant decline in agricultural areas and low shrublands and an increase in tall shrublands and forests. This represented a 20–40% increase in fuel accumulation at a landscape level, suggesting that the abandonment of farming activities is a major driving force of increasing fire occurrence in the region. With one exception, all the predictions were partly or totally confirmed. This study confirms that socioeconomic factors might explain a significant part of the variation in landscape composition across time, in the Mediterranean region. },

While “bottom-up” approaches focus on how external events and situations influence happiness, “top-down” approaches center on diverse variables within an individual and his or her culture. Noting the cultural differences between American and Korean self-construals (i.e., independence vs. interdependence), the author argues that Koreans need to construct “top-down” approaches to both well-being and spirituality. Reviewing Robert Emmon’s concept of “spiritual intelligence,” the author also suggests an integrative model for spirituality and well-being in Korea. },

  abstract={ Emotions are an important aspect of human intelligence and have been shown to play a significant role in the human decision-making process. Researchers in areas such as cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence have proposed a variety of models of emotions. Most of the previous models focus on an agent's reactive behavior, for which they often generate emotions according to static rules or pre-determined domain knowledge. However, throughout the history of research on emotions, memory and experience have been emphasized to have a major influence on the emotional process. In this paper, we propose a new computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into intelligent agents and other complex, interactive programs. The model uses a fuzzy-logic representation to map events and observations to emotional states. The model also includes several inductive learning algorithms for learning patterns of events, associations among objects, and expectations. We demonstrate empirically through a computer simulation of a pet that the adaptive components of the model are crucial to users' assessments of the believability of the agent's interactions. },

A difficulty that this assumed divide produces is that science teachers often feel that there needs to be ‘special treatment’ given to certain issues which are of an ethical or moral nature and which are ‘brought into’ the science class. The case is made in this article that dealing with ethical issues in the science class should not call for a sensitivity that is beyond the expertise of the science teacher. Indeed it is argued here that science teachers in particular have a great deal to offer in enabling ethics education. To overcome this perceived divide between science and values it needs to be recognised that the educative development of learners is both scientific and moral. I shall be using a Deweyan perspective to make the case that we as science teachers can overcome this apparent divide and significantly contribute to an ethics education of our students. },

The possible effect of gender differences on these robust findings appears to be underinvestigated. In this paper, I report two studies that take a step toward redressing this shortcoming. In Study 1, a group of young adults (N =185) were presented with a test of General Knowledge and a visual perceptual task. The results indicated the typical over/underconfidence phenomena noted above, but, when analyzed by sex, indicated statistically significant differences; men were more confident than women on both tasks. In Study 2, participants (N =303) with a wider age range completed 4 tests of cognitive ability, which were drawn from the theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence. Results indicated that the tendency for men to express higher levels of confidence than women in the accuracy of their work appears to remain constant across the life-span. These findings are discussed in relation to self-concept and gender stereotyping. },

  abstract={ Although the impact of vegetation and other environmental factors on the distribution of terrestrial invertebrates has been known since the 1950s, basic knowledge about their interaction with micro-landscape elements is lacking. In experimental model systems, the impact of varying local spatial resistance (LSR) on the distribution of Tenebrio molitor individuals was analysed in the laboratory. In the setups, LSR led to a reduction of the average distance covered (move step length) and a reduction of the velocity (the maximum speed ranging from 36.1 in the control groups to 20.4 [mm*step−1] in areas with a maximum LSR). Also, the covered distances per individual varied among three groups, from 2.97 m in the control to 1.11 m in areas with medium LSR to 0.88 m in areas with maximum LSR. Thus, in areas with LSR, animals were forced by their habitats to perform shorter move steps on average and covered less distance. The distance covered (i.e., dispersal performances) were not correlated with such factors as sex, weight and length of the Tenebrio individuals from other studies. Analysis of the data for net squared displacement indicated that the dispersal of the beetles did not follow a diffusion process. The move step directions of the dispersal data showed pronounced autocorrelation, which means that in contrast to other findings, the individuals were not performing a random walk. This effect was strongly dependent on the temporal resolution (i.e. grain), and was also influenced by the experimental conditions. The entire array of data showed high variability among the sub-groups (as well as many outliers), revealing nonparametric characteristics. The results showed that the specific physical configuration of suitable habitat for Tenebrio is one of the key indicators of landscape connectivity on the micro-scale. },

  abstract={ The continued urbanization of coastal watersheds can influence the quality of water that enters rivers and estuaries. Intelligent management of aquatic resources will require the capability to quantitatively assess and evaluate the impacts of alterations in surface waters that result from changes in patterns of land use. An aquatic ecosystem model was developed and linked to an empirical landscape model to estimate ecological risks posed by nutrients and potentially toxic trace elements (copper [Cu], cadmium [Cd], arsenic [As]) in the Patuxent River, Maryland. The empirical landscape model translated reductions in croplands within the Patuxent River watershed into corresponding changes in nitrate estimated to enter the river. Trace element concentrations were increased in relation to urbanization associated with the loss of agricultural lands in the watershed. The aquatic ecosystem model used the altered inputs of nutrients and trace elements to estimate changes in the annual production dynamics of selected producer and consumer populations within the Patuxent River. The models were implemented for four mainstem locations that defined a transect from the upper freshwater portion of the river to downstream estuarine locations. Ecological impacts were estimated for 4 hypothetical changes in land use that consisted of 10%, 7.5%, 5%, and 2.5% watershed coverage by cropland. Impacts were estimated as the probability (risk) of different magnitudes of increases or decreases in total annual production of populations representative of freshwater and estuarine food webs in the Patuxent River. },

  abstract={ In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the alleged changes in the ways the so-called digital generation communicates and learns. Most of the commentary has been based on anecdotes, observations and opinions. The lack of empirical evidence in this matter suggests that it may be time to begin the process of gathering data to confirm these views. At the forefront is the issue of which learner characteristics have changed, if any, and, accordingly, which evaluation tools are best suited to evaluate them. One mechanism found to be valid and reliable is the matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT). Developed over thirty years ago to measure cognitive tempo on an impulsive-reflective axis, this instrument was subsequently adapted into a twenty-question version. Cairns and Cammock, the researchers who modified the original into the MFFT-20, published the results of several reliability studies to demonstrate its overall effectiveness. This preliminary study is an attempt to begin the empirical verification process of using cognitive tempo as a relevant assessment tool. Two groups of K-12 students from different eras were investigated to determine if comparing cognitive tempos between subjects who took the original MFFT-20 to those who live in the current media-centric society provides any insights as to possible differences in the visual cognitive processing skills and preferences. The results of the comparative analysis, along with possible implications for teachers and instructional designers are discussed. },

  abstract={ The connectivity of a landscape can influence the dynamics of disturbances such as fire. In fire-adapted ecosystems, fire suppression may increase the connectivity of fuels and could result in qualitatively different fire patterns and behavior. We used a spatially explicit forest simulation model developed for the Sierra Nevada to investigate how the frequency of surface fires influences the connectivity of burnable area within a forest stand, and how this connectivity varies along an elevation gradient. Connectivity of burnable area was a function of fuel loads, fuel moisture, and fuel bed bulk density. Our analysis isolated the effects of fuel moisture and fuel bed bulk density to emphasize the influence of fuel loads on connectivity. Connectivity was inversely related to fire frequency and generally increased with elevation. However, certain conditions of fuel moisture and fuel bed bulk density obscured these relationships. Nonlinear patterns in connectivity across the elevation gradient occurred as a result of gradients in fuel loads and fuel bed bulk density that are simulated by the model. Changes in connectivity with elevation could affect how readily fires can spread from low elevation sites to higher elevations. },

  abstract={ While ecologists are well aware that spatial heterogeneity is scale-dependent, a general understanding of scaling relationships of spatial pattern is still lacking. One way to improve this understanding is to systematically examine how pattern indices change with scale in real landscapes of different kinds. This study, therefore, was designed to investigate how a suite of commonly used landscape metrics respond to changing grain size, extent, and the direction of analysis (or sampling) using several different landscapes in North America. Our results showed that the responses of the 19 landscape metrics fell into three general categories: Type I metrics showed predictable responses with changing scale, and their scaling relations could be represented by simple scaling equations (linear, power-law, or logarithmic functions); Type II metrics exhibited staircase-like responses that were less predictable; and Type III metrics behaved erratically in response to changing scale, suggesting no consistent scaling relations. In general, the effect of changing grain size was more predictable than that of changing extent. Type I metrics represent those landscape features that can be readily and accurately extrapolated or interpolated across spatial scales, whereas Type II and III metrics represent those that require more explicit consideration of idiosyncratic details for successful scaling. To adequately quantify spatial heterogeneity, the metric-scalograms (the response curves of metrics to changing scale), instead of single-scale measures, seem necessary. },

Many poor children arrive at school well behind their more fortunate peers academically, but chronic school-based inequities such as low teacher expectations and unexamined ability-grouping practices clearly exacerbate these differences. The minority view that racial differences in academic performance are hereditary in nature is also addressed and critiqued. },

  abstract={ YtvA from Bacillus subtilis is a blue-light responsive, flavin-binding photoreceptor, built of a light-sensing LOV domain (aa 25–126) and an NTP (nucleoside triphosphate)-binding STAS domain (aa 147–261). The STAS domain is supposed to be the effector part of the protein or a secondary switch. Both domains are connected by a linker polypeptide. The active form of YtvA is generated upon light excitation, causing the formation of a covalent bond between a cysteine residue (Cys62) in the LOV domain and the position 4a of the flavin chromophore. This photoadduct formation within the LOV domain results in a conformational change of the NTP-binding cavity, evidencing intra-protein signal transmission. We have previously shown that Glu105, localized on the beta-scaffold of the LOV-core, is involved in this process. Here, we extend this work by the identification of further residues that upon mutation supress or strongly impair signal transmission by interfering with the communication between the two domains. These comprise L106 and D109 on the LOV domain; K130 and K134 on the linker region; D193, L194 and G196 within the DLSG GTP-binding motif (switch region) and N201 on the STAS domain. Furthermore in the mutated S195A and D193A proteins, GTP affinity is diminished. Other mutations investigated have little or no effect on signal transmission and GTP-binding affinity: R63K that was found to accelerate the thermal recovery of the parent state ca. ten-fold; K128A, Q129A and Y132A within the linker region, and S183A and S212A on the STAS domain. The results show a key role of the LOV domain beta-scaffold and of positively charged residues within the linker for intra-protein signal transmission. Furthermore they evidence the conformational switch function of a structurally conserved strand-loop-helix region (bearing the DLSG GTP-binding motif and N201) within the STAS domain that constitutes a novel GTP-binding fold. },

  abstract={ Many teachers in elementary schools lack school science self-efficacy, largely because of their inexperience with the subject. This frequently leads them to avoid teaching science or to teach it in ways that compromise the development of aspects of students’ scientific literacy. This paper describes how one teacher was able to improve her school science self-efficacy through facilitated action research. In response to becoming aware of a discrepancy between her school science practices and her fundamental educational beliefs, Lisa developed a drama-based, integrated science unit that she judged successful in helping students to achieve relevant learning goals. This experience Jed Lisa and her students to feel much more positive about teaching and learning in school science. Rather than learning from another, however, “Lisa, the science teacher” learned— to a great extent—from “Lisa, the drama-based educator.” This finding has implications for science-phobic teachers and for facilitators of their action research. },

Using cognitive enhancing drugs as an exemplar, this article presents a series of hypotheses concerning how an individual might learn optimal use. The essence of the proposal is that individuals can cultivate sensitivity to the effects of ever-smaller amounts of psychoactive drugs thereby making harm less likely and benign effects more probable. Four interrelated hypotheses are presented and briefly discussed. 1. Humans can learn to discriminate ever-smaller doses of at least some mind-altering drugs; a learning program can be designed or discovered that will have this outcome. 2. The skill to discriminate drugs and dose can be generalized, i.e. if learned with one drug a second one is easier and so on. 3. Cultivating this skill/knack would be beneficial in leading to choices informed by a more accurate sense of mind-body interactions. 4. From a philosophical point of view learning the effects of ever-smaller doses of psychoactive agents offers a novel path into and to transcend the objective/subjective barrier and the mind/body problem. Whatever the fate of these specific hypotheses, discussion of cognitive enhancing drugs for healthy individuals has the potential to inspire innovative educational and public policy initiatives toward all types of mind-altering drugs and the people who use them. },

The early childhood educator is in a position to be a powerful nurturer of the social emotional development in young children. It is important, therefore, to challenge early childhood teachers, particularly veteran teachers, to take a closer look at their own social and emotional skills and to systematically reassess these skills through an emotionally intelligent “lens”. The field of emotional intelligence is a new and exciting area of academic research that looks at emotional abilities within the following four domains: (1) perception skills; (2) accessing skills; (3) understanding skills; and (4) regulation skills. This article presents a userfriendly methodology to assess and enhance the emotional intelligence abilities of teachers, and thereby impact the abilities of the young children they teach. },

The polymer exhibits polymorphism which is shown to be associated with the incorporation of the branched diamine. At relatively low temperatures, the crystal structure is similar to the gamma form which has been found in many other polyamides. At higher temperatures, a new delta form appears in which the diamine moiety adopts a bent conformation. In this form, the chains follow a zig-zag pattern with two chemical repeats units per crystallographic repeat with a shortening of about 10% along the c-axis. },

We followed a different path than those traditionally employed, and which are so well and in a deep and comprehensive way documented in other papers in this special issue. First, we consider relations between computational intelligence and artificial intelligence, starting from a reference to different kinds of views if how intelligence is meant in science, and whether it has a general nature or many different types. Then, we consider the issue of symbolic and numerical calculations, and the two attitudes for problem solving: a general one and problem specific. Then, we discuss soft computing — which is in our view a narrower area than computational intelligence — and consider two aspects implied by the inclusion of the two words: “computing”and “soft”. First, we discuss how soft computing relates to the traditionally meant computing [in the sense of (a theory of) computation]. Second, we pursue a novel path that has not been practically considered in the literature, that is — first - relations of soft computing to soft sciences, and — second — relations of soft computing to Checkland’s soft systems methodology. We hope that this paper will trigger a discussion and stimulate a new line of research with both soft computing and computational intelligence communities, on the one hand, and a broadly perceived soft science communities, on the other hand, that can bring about new ideas and novel problem formulations and solutions. },

The objective of this study was to measure the concentration and pools of toxic and total alkaloids in tall larkspur plant parts, including roots, and to evaluate the changes in these pools over the growing season as an estimate of diterpenoid alkaloid kinetics in tall larkspur. Twenty entire plants were harvested at each phenological stage: beginning of growth in the spring, early flower, early pod, late pod, and senescence. The plants were separated into their respective parts, freeze-dried, extracted, and analyzed for toxic and total alkaloid concentration, and alkaloid pools were calculated. Concentration of toxic and total alkaloids in leaves and stems declined as the plants matured, while concentration in flowers and pods increased (P &lt; 0.004). Concentration of alkaloids in the root declined in the early growth, then increased at the end of the season (P = 0.002). Alkaloid pools in the root decreased during early growth, with a corresponding increase of pools in foliar parts. In the late flower and pod stage, alkaloid pools in the leaves and stems declined rapidly, while the pool in the crown and roots tended to increase. },

In 1998, one stalk from each plant was harvested on a weekly basis; in 1999, one stalk was harvested at four times during its phenological development. Toxic and total alkaloid concentrations were measured and alkaloid pools in the entire stalk were calculated. Clipping reduced stalk height to less than 50 cm in 1998 and 65 cm in 1999, compared to over 100 cm in unclipped control plants. Alkaloid concentration was similar to control plants, but toxic alkaloid pools were 70% lower than control plants, because of the reduction in biomass of the stalks. Clipping reduced subsequent vigor and the amount of toxic and total alkaloids in tall larkspur. },

However, short-term variations (e.g. at a tidal timescale) of these organisms and their regulating factors remain unclear. We determined the time-series of fluctuations of picoplankton and viruses with tide simultaneously in flow cytometry in the Changjiang estuary during a cruise in June 2006, in which a tidal model based rectangle equation was applied. The results indicate that high cell abundances of picoplankton and viruses occurred during flood tide and low cell abundances during ebb tide. The period of the surface cell abundance variations was about 13 h, suggesting the surface cell abundances in the Changjiang estuary were largely regulated by tide. However, cell abundances in middle and bottom waters varied in different periods due to influences of tidal induced physical forces such as resuspension and stratification. Therefore, tidal action is an important factor for the diel variations of picoplankton and viruses in the Changjiang estuary. },

  abstract={ An important challenge in global-change research is to simulate short-term transient changes in climate, disturbance regime, and recruitment that drive long-term vegetation distributions. Spatial features (e.g., topographic barriers) and processes, including disturbance propagation and seed dispersal, largely control these short-term transient changes. Here we present a frame-based spatially explicit model (ALFRESCO) that simulates landscape-level response of vegetation to transient changes in climate and explicitly represents the spatial processes of disturbance propagation and seed dispersal. The spatial model and the point model from which it was developed showed similar results in some cases, but diverged in situations where interactions among neighboring cells (fire spread and seed dispersal) were crucial. Topographic barriers had little influence on fire size in low-flammability vegetation types, but reduced the average fire size and increased the number of fires in highly flammable vegetation (dry grassland). Large fires were more common in landscapes with large contiguous patches of two vegetation types while a more heterogeneous vegetation distribution increased fires in the less flammable vegetation type. When climate was held constant for thousands of years on a hypothetical landscape with the same initial vegetation, the spatial and point models produced identical results for some climates (cold, warm, and hot mesic), but produced markedly different results at current climate and when much drier conditions were imposed under a hot climate. Spruce migration into upland tundra was slowed or prevented by topographic barriers, depending on the size of the corridor. We suggest that frame-based, spatially explicit models of vegetation response to climate change are a useful tool to investigate both short- and long-term transients in vegetation at the regional scale. We also suggest that it is difficult to anticipate when non-spatial models will be reliable and when spatially explicit models are essential. ALFRESCO provides an important link between models of landscape-level vegetation dynamics and larger spatio-temporal models of global climate change. },

  abstract={ Detecting human impacts on riverine systems is challenging because of the diverse biological, chemical, hydrological and geophysical components that must be assessed. We briefly review the chemical, biotic, hydrologic and physical habitat assessment approaches commonly used in riverine systems. We then discuss how landscape indicators can be used to assess the status of rivers by quantifying land cover changes in the surrounding catchment, and contrast landscape-level indicators with the more traditionally used approaches. Landscape metrics that describe the amount and arrangement of human-altered land in a catchment provide a direct way to measure human impacts and can be correlated with many traditionally used riverine indicators, such as water chemistry and biotic variables. The spatial pattern of riparian habitats may also be an especially powerful landscape indicator because the variation in length, width, and gaps of riparian buffers influences their effectiveness as nutrient sinks. The width of riparian buffers is also related to the diversity of riparian bird species. Landscape indicators incorporating historical land use may also hold promise for predicting and assessing the status of riverine systems. Importantly, the relationship between an aquatic system attribute and a landscape indicator may be non-linear and thus exhibit threshold responses. This has become especially apparent from landscape indicators quantifying the percent impervious surface (or urban areas) in a watershed, a landscape indicator of hydrologic and geomorphic change. },

Carotid artery (CA) elasticity was measured by incremental elastic modulus (Einc)-wall stress curves using an ultrasonic echo-tracking device and the measurement of medial cross-sectional area (MCSA) to evaluate in vivo CA mechanical properties. Cardiac function was studied by echocardiography in anaesthetized animals. Infusion of Ang II (200ng/kg/min) in α1–/– mice and their control (α1+/+) for 4 weeks led to similar hypertensive effect (SAP +31 vs +37 mmHg). In α1–/– Ang II failed to increase MCSA of CA whereas it did in α1+/+ mice. The Einc-stress curve of Ang II-treated α1–/– was shifted to the right compared to Ang II-treated α1+/+, indicating a decreased arterial stiffness. The α1+/+ had an increased cardiac hypertrophy, evaluated by an increase of the end diastolic thickness of the septum (IVSd: 1.2±1 vs 0.9±0.08 mm) without modification of the posterior wall (LVPWd: 0.10±0.6 vs 0.97±0.07 mm) and without dilation of the ventricular cavity. This septal hypertrophy was not found in the α1–/– mice in response to Ang II. Cardiac fibrosis measured by collagen quantification (total, and type I and III), was lower in the α1–/– mice, compared with the α1+/+. In conclusion, our results show an impaired of cardiovascular response to Ang II-induced hypertension in the integrin α1 knockout mouse. These results suggest the involvement of this integrin in the cardiovascular effects of Ang II. },

  abstract={ A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: we take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for machines. },

His work needs to be seen against the background of the changing position of classics in his time. Whatever, had he lived longer, might have come of the various research projects mentioned in this correspondence, he was in advance of his time in his openminded attitude regarding the influence on Greek civilization of the older cultures of the Near East.

  abstract={ The growing number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes reveals a wide distribution of open reading frames (ORFs) that putatively encode for red- and blue light sensing photoreceptors. They comprise the bilin-binding phytochromes and the flavin-binding cryptochromes, LOV and BLUFproteins, indicating that about 1/4 of bacteria do possess at least one of these photosensory proteins. The distribution of red- and blue-light sensors among different prokaryotic phyla and classes, and their functional activity as light-switched systems are the subject of this perspective. These photoreceptors were originally found in plants by following the associated physiological responses induced by the respective spectral irradiation. Genome-based approaches now require the assignment of a photochemical/physiological function to the heterologously expressed gene product. Database searches demonstrate in some cases several genes of one category in a certain prokaryot, indicating the presence of more than one type of red- or blue-light sensing properties, but also show a combination of proteins with both spectral sensitivities. Another interesting feature now “comes into light”: according to their nature as biological sensors, these photoreceptors are equipped with signalling domains, initiating a cellular response, thereby constituting modular systems switchable by light. It is seen that many of these signalling domains, now found together with light-inducible sensing domains, were already described for other stimuli, e.g., osmo-regulation, oxygen, hydrogen, chemicals, or pH. In some cases, the same type of signalling domain can be found in a red- or a blue-light sensing photoreceptor. Following the characterization of their photochemistry, for several of these bacterial photoreceptors physiological functions are now assigned. },

  abstract={ The Bacillus subtilis protein YtvA is related to plant phototropins in that it senses UVA—blue-light by means of the flavin binding LOV domain, linked to a nucleotide-binding STAS domain. The structural basis for interdomain interactions and functional regulation are not known. Here we report the conformational analysis of three YtvA constructs, by means of size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism (CD) and molecular docking simulations. The isolated YtvA-LOV domain (YLOV, aa 25–126) has a strong tendency to dimerize, prevented in full-length YtvA, but still observed in YLOV carrying the N-terminal extension (N-YLOV, aa 1–126). The analysis of CD data shows that both the N-terminal cap and the linker region (aa 127–147) between the LOV and the STAS domain are helical and that the central β-scaffold is distorted in the LOV domains dimers. The involvement of the central β-scaffold in dimerization is supported by docking simulation of the YLOV dimer and the importance of this region is highlighted by light-induced conformational changes, emerging from the CD data analysis. In YtvA, the β-strand fraction is notably less distorted and distinct light-driven changes in the loops/turn fraction are detected. The data uncover a common surface for LOV–LOV and intraprotein interaction, involving the central β-scaffold, and offer hints to investigate the molecular basis of light-activation and regulation in LOV proteins. },

The principal idea of enaction is that a cognitive system develops it own understanding of the world around it through its interactions with the environment. Thus, enaction entails that the cognitive system operates autonomously and that it generates its own models of how the world works. A discussion of the five key elements of enaction - autonomy, embodiment, emergence, experience, and sense-making - leads to a core set of functional, organizational, and developmental requirements which are then used in the design of a cognitive architecture for the iCub humanoid robot. },

  abstract={ We review and analyze the growing family of bacterial proteins carrying the LOV (light oxygen voltage) motif, a flavin-binding photoactive domain first characterized in plant blue-light receptors, the phototropins. A total of 29 sequences encoding LOV-proteins can be detected in the genomes of 24 bacterial species. In the bacterial LOV domains, the majority of the amino acids known to interact with the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore in phototropin LOVs are conserved, supporting the suggestion of their possible role as blue-light sensors. The Bacillus subtilis protein YtvA has been the first bacterial LOV-protein shown to bind FMN and to undergo the same light-induced reactions as plant phototropins. The photocycle involves the reversible formation of a covalent adduct between FMN and a conserved cysteine. In this work we report preliminary results on a Caulobacter crescentus LOV-kinase, that undergoes the same photochemistry as YtvA. The bacterial LOV-proteins exhibit a variety of effector domains associated to the light-responsive LOV-domain, e.g. histidine kinase, transcriptional regulators, putative phosphodiesterases and regulators of stress factors, pointing to their physiological role as sensing and signalling proteins. },

  abstract={ Cellular processes and indeed the survival of entire organisms crucially depend on precise spatiotemporal coordination of a multitude of molecular events. A new tool in cell biology is denoted “optogenetics” which describes the use of genetically encoded, light-gated proteins, i.e. photoreceptors, which perturb and control cellular and organismal behavior in a spatiotemporally exact manner. Photoreceptors resemble fluorescent reporter proteins such as GFP in being genetically encoded, non-invasive, and applicable to intact cells and organisms. They are explicitly intended to modulate activity; in contrast, fluorescent proteins generally do not disturb the processes under study. Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized cell biology because they allow the monitoring of such processes by imaging techniques that offer superb spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity. Optogenetics extends these advantages to offer control. The scope of optogenetics has recently been expanded beyond the use of naturally occurring photoreceptors by the biologically-inspired design of engineered (or synthetic) photoreceptors. These photoreceptors are derived by fusion of one or more light-absorbing sensor domains with an output or effector domain displaying the activity to be controlled. Here, we focus on the design and application of such engineered photoreceptors. We treat basic signaling principles and discuss the two photosensor classes which are currently most widely used in fusion-based design: LOV domains and phytochromes. Based on these principles, we develop general strategies for the engineering of photoreceptors. Finally, we review recently successful examples of the design and application of engineered photoreceptors. Our perspective provides guidelines for researchers interested in developing and applying novel optogenetic tools. },

However, when the 15 facets of self-estimated EI were combined into a single reliable scale and the participants's measured trait EI scores were held constant, it was demonstrated that males believed they had higher EI than females. Most of the correlations between measured and self-estimated scores were significant and positive, thereby indicating that people have some insight into their EI. Correlations between measured and self-estimated scores were generally higher for males than females, and a regression analysis indicated that gender was a significant predictor of self-estimated EI. },

Such an invitation, we suggest, involves troubling manifestations of pedagogical and epistemic desires of normative closures and certitude.

  abstract={ This essay considers the question of why we should teach science to K-2. After initial consideration of two traditional reasons for studying science, six assertions supporting the idea that even small children should be exposed to science are given. These are, in order: (1) Children naturally enjoy observing and thinking about nature. (2) Exposing students to science develops positive attitudes towards science. (3) Early exposure to scientific phenomena leads to better understanding of the scientific concepts studied later in a formal way. (4) The use of scientifically informed language at an early age influences the eventual development of scientific concepts. (5) Children can understand scientific concepts and reason scientifically. (6) Science is an efficient means for developing scientific thinking. Concrete illustrations of some of the ideas discussed in this essay, particularly, how language and prior knowledge may influence the development of scientific concepts, are then provided. The essay concludes by emphasizing that there is a window of opportunity that educators should exploit by presenting science as part of the curriculum in both kindergarten and the first years of primary school. },

  abstract={ Cooperative education (co-op) is a strategy of education that includes a requirement for successful completion of both formal classroom work and work placements in order to gain a qualification. The work placement immerses the student in relevant, productive work, and is seen as an integral part of the educational program. There is anecdotal and research data in the literature about the success of co-op programs in securing career jobs for students. However, little theorizing and research about learning in placements has been published that could help us understand how undertaking work placements in science can assist students to make the transition into the scientific workplace. Sociocultural views of learning that depict learning as a mediated, situated and participatory activity within a socially and culturally determined community of practice provide a theoretical perspective for investigating the enculturation of science students into the science community through work placements. This paper reports on a study that used sociocultural views of learning to investigate what and how a cohort of co-op students learned about the science community through their co-op program. },

It is found that ethical leadership is positively and significantly associated with transformational leadership, transformational culture of organization, contingent reward dimension of transactional leadership, leader effectiveness, employee willingness to put in extra effort, and employee satisfaction with the leader. However, it is also found that ethical leadership bears no correlations with transactional leadership. Also, it is negatively correlated with laissez-faire leadership and transactional culture of the organization. The findings also reveal that ethical leadership plays a mediating role in the relationship between employee outcomes and organizational culture. Practical implications of these findings are discussed. Directions for future research are also suggested. },

Practice alone will enable an individual to reach a certain level of proficiency, but only practice in combination with ability can result in world-class performance. If, as is argued, native ability in some domain is a rare commodity, then harnessing it and developing it through practice would provide an opportunity for a potential aggrandizer to control prestige goods and accrue social capital. In situations where raw material, knowledge, and know-how are ubiquitous, as may have been true for flint technology in southern Scandinavia during the Late Neolithic, this might be one of few means available for a would-be aggrandizer to control prestigious goods. },

  abstract={ This study explores ecological vulnerability to land-use change in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region by spatially extrapolating land and economic development, and overlaying these projections with maps of sensitive ecological resources. As individual extrapolations have a high degree of uncertainty, five methods with different theoretical bases are employed. Confidence in projections is increased for counties targeted by two or more projection methods. A county is considered at risk if it currently supports three or more sensitive resources, and is projected to experience significant growth by the year 2010 by two or more methods. Analysis designated 19 counties and two cities as at risk, highlighting within a large region the priority areas where state and regional efforts would contribute the most to integrating environmental considerations into the process of land development. The study also found that potentially severe ecological effects of future land-use change are not limited to the outskirts of major urban areas. Recreational demands on smaller communities with mountain and coastal resources are also significant, as are initiatives to promote economic development in rural areas of high ecological quality. This approach provides a comprehensive overview of potential regional development, leading to an objective prioritization of high-risk areas. The intent is to inform local planning and decision-making so that regional and cumulative ecological degradation are minimized. },

Other uses for neutral models have become apparent, including the development and testing of landscape metrics to characterize landscape pattern. Although metric development proved to be significant, the focus on metrics obscured the need for iterative hypothesis testing fundamental to the advancement of the discipline. We present here an example of an alternative neutral model and hypothesis designed to relate the process of landscape change to observed landscape patterns. The methods and program, QRULE, are described and options for statistical testing outlined. The results show that human fragmentation of landscapes results in a non-random association of land-cover types that can be describe by simple statistical methods. Options for additional landscape studies are discussed and access to QRULE described in the hope that these methods will be employed to advance our understanding of the processes that affect the structure and function in human dominated landscapes. },

  abstract={ In 1987, a catastrophic fire burned over 1 330 000 ha in the densely forested area of the Da Hinggan Mountains in the northeastern China. After the fire, intensive management including burned trunk harvesting and coniferous tree planting had been conducted to accelerate forest restoration. To study the long term effect of these activities on forest recovery, we used a simulation modeling approach to study long-term (300 years) forest dynamics under current planting and natural regeneration scenarios. Results indicate that under tree planting scenario in the severely burned area, the dominant species Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) can reach pre-fire level (60% of the area) within 20 years and the maximum abundance can reach nearly 90% within 100 years. While under natural regeneration scenario, it needs about 250 years to reach its pre-fire level. From the perspective of timber production, tree planting can bring twice as much timber volume as that under natural regeneration within 300 years, which is the average longevity of L. gmelinii. It needs about 70 years to reach the timber volume of pre-fire level under the planting scenario, whereas it requires at least 250 years to reach the timber volume of pre-fire level under natural regeneration scenario. Another dominant species Asian White birch (Betula platyphylla) responded negatively to the planting of coniferous species. In general, tree planting of coniferous species after fire can greatly accelerate forest restoration in terms of species abundance and target timber volume, with desirable ecological and economic returns. },

  abstract={ The crystallization behavior and fine structure of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/A-zeolite nanocomposites were assessed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS). The Avrami exponent increased from 3.5 to approximately 4.5 with increasing A-zeolite contents, thereby indicating a change in crystal growth formation. The rate constant,k, evidenced an increasing trend with increases in A-zeolite contents. The SAXS data revealed morphological changes occurring during isothermal crystallization. As the zeolite content increased, the long period and amorphous region size also increased. It has been suggested that, since PET molecules passed through the zeolite pores, some of them are rejected into the amorphous region, thereby resulting in increased amorphous region size and increased long period, respectively. In addition, as PET chains piercing into A-zeolite pores cannot precipitate perfect crystal folding, imperfect crystals begin to melt at an earlier temperature, as was revealed by the SAXS profiles obtained during heating. However, the spherulite size was reduced with increasing nanofiller content, because impingement between adjacent spherulites in the nanocomposite occurs earlier than that of homo PET, due to the increase in nucleating sites. },

  abstract={ Landscape structure in a forest mosaic changes with spatial scale (i.e. spatial extent) and thresholds may occur where structure changes markedly. Forest management alters landscapestructure and may affect the intensity and location of thresholds. Our purpose was to examine landscape structure at different scales to determine thresholds where landscape structure changes markedly in managed forest mosaics of the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. We also investigated how logging influences landscape structure and whether these management activities change threshold values. Using threshold and autocorrelation analyses, we found that thresholds in landscape indices exist at 400, 500, and 800 m intervals from the outer edge of management units in our studyregion. For landscape indices that consider all landcovercategories, such as dominance and contagion, landscape structureand thresholds did not change after logging occurred. Measurements for these overall landscape indices were stronglyinfluenced by midsuccessional deciduous forest, the most commonlandcover category in the landscape. When restricting analysesfor mean patch size and percent cover to individual forest types,thresholds for early-successional forests changed after logging. However, logging changed the landscape structure at small spatialscale, but did not alter the structure of the entire forestmosaic. Previous forest management may already have increasedthe heterogeneity of the landscape beyond the point whereadditional small cuts alter the overall structure of the forest. Because measurements for landscape indices yield very differentresults at different spatial scales, it is important first toidentify thresholds in order to determine the appropriate scalesfor landscape ecological studies. We found that threshold andautocorrelation analyses were simple but powerful tools for thedetection of appropriate scales in the managed forest mosaicunder study. },

  abstract={ Ecological interactions among individuals and disturbances are two important agents of pattern formation. In this study we investigated the interrelationships between interactions among individuals and large scale disturbances, and the resulting patterns. We categorized disturbances into three general classes, (1) those whose probability of occurrence increases with increased densities of vegetation, such as fire and disease, (2) those with a decreasing probability of occurrence with increasing vegetation densities, such as sand movement, and (3) disturbances that occur independently of vegetation densities, such as flooding. The ecological interactions among individuals were also divided to three classes: competition, facilitation and neutrality. We systematically investigated how these two types of processes interact to generate spatial patterns, using simulation models that were partially based on data collected from a shrub community in the Nizzana sand dune ecosystem. The results indicated that the different types of disturbances have fundamentally different effects on spatial patterns. Positive density-dependent disturbances, regardless of the type of interactions among individuals with which they were simulated, generated uniform spatial patterns. Patterns formed by interactions between decreasing or density independent disturbances with the different class interactions among individuals were more variable. These differences are attributed to the manner in which the difference disturbance types propagate in space. },

The study examined the bioconversion of oleic acid to 7,10-dihydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic acid (DOD) and ricinoleic acid to 7,10,12-trihydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic acid (TOD). A new DOD-like compound from linoleic acid was observed. All strains except NRRL B-247 exhibited varying levels of DOD production. NRRL B-1000, NRRL B-18602 and NRRL B-23258 with yields up to 84% were among the best DOD producers. TOD production generally paralleled DOD production at a relatively lower yield of up to 15%. Strains NRRL B-1000 and NRRL B-23260 were the best TOD producers. A DOD-like product in low yields was obtained from linoleic acid. The fatty acid bioconversion capability was related neither to growth rate nor to variation in the greenish pigmentation of the strains. Production of significant quantities of DOD and TOD from oleic and ricinoleic acids, respectively, appeared to be a characteristic trait of P. aeruginosa strains. A number of highly effective strains for DOD production were identified. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of modelled area burned to environmental factors across a range of independently-developed landscape-fire-succession models. The sensitivity of area burned to variation in four factors, namely terrain (flat, undulating and mountainous), fuel pattern (finely and coarsely clumped), climate (observed, warmer &amp; wetter, and warmer &amp; drier) and weather (year-to-year variability) was determined for four existing landscape-fire-succession models (EMBYR, FIRESCAPE, LANDSUM and SEM-LAND) and a new model implemented in the LAMOS modelling shell (LAMOS(DS)). Sensitivity was measured as the variance in area burned explained by each of the four factors, and all of the interactions amongst them, in a standard generalised linear modelling analysis. Modelled area burned was most sensitive to climate and variation in weather, with four models sensitive to each of these factors and three models sensitive to their interaction. Models generally exhibited a trend of increasing area burned from observed, through warmer and wetter, to warmer and drier climates with a 23-fold increase in area burned, on average, from the observed to the warmer, drier climate. Area burned was sensitive to terrain for FIRESCAPE and fuel pattern for EMBYR. These results demonstrate that the models are generally more sensitive to variation in climate and weather as compared with terrain complexity and fuel pattern, although the sensitivity to these latter factors in a small number of models demonstrates the importance of representing key processes. The models that represented fire ignition and spread in a relatively complex fashion were more sensitive to changes in all four factors because they explicitly simulate the processes that link these factors to area burned. },

  abstract={ Zinc is required for multiple cellular tasks, and especially the immune system depends on a sufficient availability of this essential trace element. During the last decades, many studies attempted to affect the outcome of various diseases by zinc supplementation. These efforts either aimed at supporting immunity by zinc administration or at correcting a loss of zinc secondary to the disease to restore the zinc-dependent functions of the immune system. This review aims to summarize the respective findings and to discuss possible molecular mechanisms by which zinc could influence viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, and the response to vaccination. Zinc supplementation in diseases such as diarrhea, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, pneumonia, acute lower respiratory infection, and leishmaniasis seems beneficial. In contrast, the results for the common cold and malaria are still not conclusive, and zinc was ineffective in most vaccination and rheumatoid arthritis studies. For AIDS and type 1 diabetes, zinc supplementation may even be a risk factor for increased mortality or deterioration of the glucose metabolism, respectively. In these cases, zinc supplementation should be used with care and limited to clearly zinc-deficient individuals. },

  abstract={ A site suitability model of urban development was created for the Santa Monica Mountains in southern California, USA, to project to what degree future development might fragment the natural habitat. The purpose was to help prioritize land acquisition for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and examine to what extent projected urban development would affect distinct vegetation classes. The model included both environmental constraints (slope angle), and spatial factors related to urban planning (proximity to roads and existing development, proposed development, and areas zoned for development). It implemented a stochastic component; areas projected to have high development potential in the suitability model were randomly selected for development. Ownership tracts were used as the spatial unit of development in order to give the model spatial realism and not arbitrarily `develop' grid cells. Using different assumptions and parameters, the model projected the pattern of development from ∼5 to ∼25 years hence (based on recent development rates in the area). While &lt;25% of the remaining natural landscape is removed under these scenarios, up to 30% of core (interior) habitat area is lost and edge length between natural vegetation and development increases as much as 45%. Measures of landscape shape complexity increased with area developed and number of patches of natural habitat increased four- to nine-fold, depending upon model parameters. This increase in fragmentation occurs because of the existing patterns of land ownership, where private (`developable') land is interspersed with preserved park lands. },

  abstract={ Few studies of land-use/land-cover change provide an integrated assessment of the driving forces and consequences of that change, particularly in Africa. Our objectives were to determine how driving forces at different scales change over time, how these forces affect the dynamics and patterns of land use/land cover, and how land-use/land-cover change affects ecological properties at the landscape scale. To accomplish these objectives, we first developed a way to identify the causes and consequences of change at a landscape scale by integrating tools from ecology and the social sciences and then applied these methods to a case study in Ghibe Valley, southwestern Ethiopia. Maps of land-use/land-cover change were created from aerial photography and Landsat TM imagery for the period, 1957–1993. A method called `ecological time lines' was developed to elicit landscape-scale explanations for changes from long-term residents. Cropland expanded at twice the speed recently (1987–1993) than two decades ago (1957–1973), but also contracted rapidly between 1973–1987. Rapid land-use/land cover change was caused by the combined effects of drought and migration, changes in settlement and land tenure policy, and changes in the severity of the livestock disease, trypanosomosis, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly. The scale of the causes and consequences of land-use/land-cover change varied from local to sub-national (regional) to international and the links between causes and consequences crossed scales. At the landscape scale, each cause affected the location and pattern of land use/land cover differently. The contraction of cropland increased grass biomass and cover, woody plant cover, the frequency and extent of savanna burning, and the abundance of wildlife. With recent control of the tsetse fly, these ecological changes are being reversed. These complex patterns are discussed in the context of scaling issues and current conceptual models of land-use/land-cover change. },

  abstract={ The ecological interpretation of landscape patterns is one of the major objectives in landscape ecology. Both landscape patterns and ecological processes need to be quantified before statistical relationships between these variables can be examined. Landscape indices provide quantitative information about landscape pattern. Response variables or process rates quantify the outcome of ecological processes (e.g., dispersal success for landscape connectivity or Morisita's index for the spatial distribution of individuals). While the principal potential of this approach has been demonstrated in several studies, the robustness of the statistical relationships against variations in landscape structure or against variations of the ecological process itself has never been explicitly investigated. This paper investigates the consistency of correlations between a set of landscape indices (calculated with Fragstats) and three response variables from a simulated dispersal process across heterogeneous landscapes (cell immigration, dispersal success and search time) against variation in three experimental treatments (control variables): habitat amount, habitat fragmentation and dispersal behavior. I found strong correlations between some landscape indices and all three response variables. However, 68% of the statistical relationships were highly inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous for different landscape structures and for differences in dispersal behavior. Correlations between one landscape index and one response variable could range from highly positive to highly negative when derived from different spatial patterns. I furthermore compared correlation coefficients obtained from artificially generated (neutral) landscape models with those obtained from Landsat TM images. Both landscape representations produced equally strong and weak statistical relationships between landscape indices and response variables. This result supports the use of neutral landscape models in theoretical analyses of pattern-process relationships. },

  abstract={ Due to the inherent complexity of the natural biological environment, most studies on polypeptides, proteins and nucleic acids have so far been performed in vitro, away from physiologically relevant conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance is an ideal technique to extend the in&nbsp;vitro analysis of simple model systems to the more complex biological context. This work shows how diffusion-based spectroscopic selection can be combined with isotopic labeling to tackle and optimize the NMR analysis of specific macromolecules in multicomponent mixtures. Typical media include cell-free systems containing overexpressed proteins, lysates and proteolytic mixtures. We present a few variants of diffusion-edited HSQC pulse sequences for the selective spectroscopic detection of protein and polypeptide resonances within complex mixtures containing undesired species of smaller molecular weight. Due to diffusion-based filtering, peak intensities of fast diffusing small molecules are attenuated more than peaks due to large molecules. The basic sequence, denoted as PFGSTE-HSQC, combines translational diffusion-ordering with two dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy. The GCSTE-HSQC and BPPSTE-HSQC sequences include bipolar gradients and are therefore suitable for both diffusion-based filtering and determination of diffusion coefficients of individual mixture components. Practical applications range from protein stability/folding investigations in physiologically relevant contexts to prescreening of tertiary fold and resonance assignments in structural genomics studies. A few applications of diffusion-edited HSQC to an E. coli cell lysate containing the 15N-labeled B domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1), and to a 15N-labeled N-acetylglycine/apomyoglobin mixture are presented. In addition, we provide specific guidelines for experimental setup and parameter optimization.

  abstract={ The effect of substrate heterogeneity on the structure of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages (total abundance, taxon richness, and evenness) is still not clear, but this could be due to the lack of standard methods for quantifying substrate heterogeneity. An accurate quantification of substrate heterogeneity was obtained from photographs of sampled areas (each 225 cm2), which were used to create maps that were subsequently digitized and analyzed using image analysis software. These maps allowed the calculation of multiple metrics quantifying two aspects of substrate heterogeneity: composition and spatial configuration of substrate patches. The diversity of substrate types (calculated as the Shannon diversity index), and the heterogeneity of patch compactness (calculated as the coefficient of variation of the relationship between patch dimensions) were the metrics explaining more biotic variance at the sample scale, but at higher scales there were no relationships between assemblage structure and substrate heterogeneity. Most variation in substrate heterogeneity occurred at the sample scale, while some metrics varied significantly at riffle or segment scales; these patterns of variation match those of macroinvertebrate assemblages, which had been previously studied. The importance of quantifying substrate heterogeneity and considering the spatial scales of its study are discussed. },

In this approach, wetland condition is evaluated in an intensive assessment through detailed, on-site measurement of physical and biological condition, and is inferred in a landscape assessment from a wetland’s landscape setting characterized with available spatial data. This study assessed a comprehensive set of landscape metrics to improve an existing landscape assessment using wetland condition measures from the Upper Juniata intensive assessment data. On-site measures of wetland state (n = 10) were compared with landscape metrics (n = 47) measured at multiple spatial scales using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Landscape metrics enhanced the existing landscape assessment if they were correlated with condition metrics not correlated with the existing landscape assessment. Finally, landscape metrics identified through the correlation analysis were used to place sites in categories of condition based on the Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) using classification and regression tree analysis (CART). Results showed the existing landscape assessment metric is correlated with multiple measures of wetland state. The study identified landscape metrics that could enhance the existing landscape assessment, including measures of near-stream land use measured at an upstream scale, the percent of agriculture on steep slopes in a 250-m-radius circle or upstream area, and a measure of interior forest measured at a 250-m landscape circle or an upstream scale. Finally, the CART analysis showed the prediction of the FQAI was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) improved by the addition of the landscape metrics identified in this study. },

  abstract={ Wetland management in the United States is organized through a permit process that requires a permit be filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to wetland alteration. A collection of these permits from 1984 through 1992 was analyzed in conjunction with classified Landsat Thematic Mapper data from 1984 and 1992 in order to quantify changes to wetland habitat in the study area in coastal North Carolina. The wetland management process in the U.S. focuses on a site-by-site review, possibly overlooking important changes to wetlands at the landscape-scale. These the two datasets were used to determine if wetland habitat loss was occurring at permit sites, but also to determine if landscape-scale wetland fragmentation and reorganization were occurring in the area surrounding each permit site under the wetland management process. The use of these two datasets attempted to span two scales: the site-specific scale often used in the management of wetlands, and the landscape-scale where effects of such management are evident. Important conclusions from the research include the following. First, while several sources imply that coastal wetlands are disproportionately protected as a result of the widespread recognition of their habitat value, estuarine wetlands were altered much more frequently in the study area than their inland counterparts. Second, despite federal level efforts that require compensatory mitigation when wetland habitat is lost, such mitigation was required in only three percent of permits, ensuring wetland loss. Third, correlation between estimates of wetland loss from the Permit Record and from the remotely sensed record was minimal, highlighting the problems inherent to wetland delineation and implying alterations to habitat not evidenced in the permit record. Finally, landscape-scale changes of loss, fragmentation and habitat reorganization have occurred in estuarine emergent wetland habitat in areas adjacent to several permit sites, implying unanticipated additional impacts to permitted actions. Wetland loss at the permit site occurred with additional fragmentation in 80 percent of the sites examined. The results highlight the lack of agreement between management and landscape-scale wetland structure, function and change, and imply the importance of examining the spatial context of permit sites in the permit review and evaluation procedure. },

  abstract={ Resource managers confronted with preserving ecosystems for prairie wetland birds in fragmented landscapes require landscape studies that direct conservation efforts over broad geographic regions. We investigated the role of local and landscape factors affecting habitat suitability by integrating remotely sensed wetland and land-cover data with wetland bird habitat models. We linked habitat models with locations of easement and fee-title wetlands to evaluate spatial location and extent of protected, suitable habitat. We also simulated impacts of the loss of small wetlands on suitability of larger wetlands for mobile species that use multiple wetlands. Lastly, we evaluated the efficacy of waterfowl habitat programs in preserving suitable habitat for nongame wetland bird species to recommend strategies for maximizing regional landscape connectivity. Regional databases constructed for this study indicate that easement and fee-title tracts encompass 13.9% (1.2 million ha) of land area and protect 19.8% of the wetlands in eastern South Dakota, USA. Proportion of protected wetlands is highest for semi-permanent (32.3%), intermediate for seasonal (25.6%), and lowest for temporary wetlands (15.8%). A stratified, two-stage cluster sample was used to randomly select 834 semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands that were surveyed for birds in 1995 and 1996. Logistic analyses indicate that habitat suitability for some species (e.g., Virginia rail, pied-billed grebe) is related to local vegetation conditions within wetlands, while suitability for others (e.g., northern pintail, black tern) is related to landscape structure at larger scales. As a result, unfragmented prairie wetland landscapes (i.e., areas with wetland complexes embedded within upland grasslands) provide habitat for more species than isolated wetlands in tillage fields. Models developed from survey wetlands were used to classify habitat suitability for all semi-permanent and seasonal wetlands in eastern South Dakota. Small wetlands are critical components of the surrounding landscape that influence habitat suitability of larger wetlands. Models used to reclassify suitability of larger remaining wetlands after small wetlands (&lt;0.5 ha) were removed indicate that species most vulnerable to loss of small wetlands are vagile species that exploit resources over broad spatial scales. Number of wetlands suitable for northern pintails, a mobile species that uses multiple wetlands within a season, decreased 20.7% when wetlands &lt;0.5 ha were removed. Historic paradigms dictating waterfowl habitat protection efforts also have conserved habitat for nongame bird species. Modern paradigms that acknowledge the importance of small shallow wetlands to breeding waterfowl have shifted the focus of protection towards preserving habitat for species that occupy more abundant seasonal wetlands. Cessation of protection efforts would result in further fragmentation of regional wetland landscapes. We recommend that wetlands be acquired not only to consolidate suitable habitat within protected core areas but also to ensure that core areas coalesce to preserve connectivity among regional wetland landscapes. },

  abstract={ An extensive road system with rapidly increasing traffic produces diverse ecological effects that cover a large land area. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of roads with different traffic volumes on surrounding avian distributions, and its importance relative to other variables. Grassland bird data (5 years) for 84 open patches in an outer suburban/rural landscape near Boston were analyzed relative to: distance from roads with 3000–8000 to &gt;30,000 vehicles/day; open-habitat patch size; area of quality microhabitat within a patch; adjacent land use; and distance to other open patches. Grassland bird presence and regular breeding correlated significantly with both distance from road and habitat patch size. Distance to nearest other open patch, irrespective of size, was not significant. Similarly, except for one species, adjacent land use, in this case built area, was not significant. A light traffic volume of 3000–8000 vehicles/day (local collector street here) had no significant effect on grassland bird distribution. For moderate traffic of 8000–15,000 (through street), there was no effect on bird presence although regular breeding was reduced for 400 m from a road. For heavier traffic of 15,000–30,000 (two-lane highway), both bird presence and breeding were decreased for 700 m. For a heavy traffic volume of ≥30,000 vehicles/day (multilane highway), bird presence and breeding were reduced for 1200 m from a road. The results suggest that avian studies and long-term surveys near busy roads may be strongly affected by traffic volume or changes in volume. We conclude that road ecology, especially the effects extending outward &gt;100 m from roads with traffic, is a sine qua non for effective land-use and transportation policy. },

  abstract={ A measure of the historic range of variability (HRV) in landscape structure is essential for evaluating current landscape patterns of Rocky Mountain coniferous forests that have been subjected to intensive timber harvest. We used a geographic information system (GIS) and FRAGSTATS to calculate key landscape metrics on two ∼130,000-ha landscapes in the Greater Yellowstone Area, USA: one in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), which has been primarily shaped by natural fires, and a second in the adjacent Targhee National Forest (TNF), which has undergone intensive clearcutting for nearly 30 years. Digital maps of the current and historical landscape in YNP were developed from earlier stand age maps developed by Romme and Despain. Maps of the TNF landscape were adapted from United States Forest Service Resource Information System (RIS) data. Key landscape metrics were calculated at 20-yr intervals for YNP for the period from 1705-1995. These metrics were used to first evaluate the relative effects of small vs. large fire events on landscape structure and were then compared to similar metrics calculated for both pre- and post-harvest landscapes of the TNF. Large fires, such as those that burned in 1988, produced a structurally different landscape than did previous, smaller fires (1705-1985). The total number of patches of all types was higher after 1988 (694 vs. 340-404 before 1988), and mean patch size was reduced by almost half (186 ha vs. 319-379 ha). The amount of unburned forest was less following the 1988 fires (63% vs. 72-90% prior to 1988), yet the number of unburned patches increased by nearly an order of magnitude (230 vs. a maximum of 41 prior to 1988). Total core area and mean core area per patch decreased after 1988 relative to smaller fires (∼73,700 ha vs. 87,000-110,000 ha, and 320 ha vs. 2,123 ha, respectively). Notably, only edge density was similar (17 m ha−1 after 1988) to earlier landscapes (9.8-14.2 m ha−1).Three decades of timber harvesting dramatically altered landscape structure in the TNF. Total number of patches increased threefold (1,481 after harvest vs. 437 before harvest), and mean patch size decreased by ∼70% (91.3 ha vs. 309 ha). None of the post-harvest landscape metrics calculated for the TNF fell within the HRV as defined in YNP, even when the post-1988 landscape was considered. In contrast, pre-harvest TNF landscape metrics were all within, or very nearly within, the HRV for YNP. While reference conditions such as those identified by this study are useful for local and regional landscape evaluation and planning, additional research is necessary to understand the consequences of changes in landscape structure for population, community, ecosystem, and landscape function. },

  abstract={ The phase behavior of semicrystalline, aliphatic nylons is analyzed on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry, DSC, and quasi-isothermal, temperature-modulated DSC, TMDSC. The data of main interest are the apparent heat capacities, C p, in the temperature range from below the glass transitions to above the isotropization. Based on the contributions of the vibrational motion to C p, as is available from measurements in our laboratory, the ATHAS Data Bank, and multifaceted new TMDSC results, as well as on information on the crystal structures, NMR, molecular dynamics simulation of paraffin crystals, and quasi-elastic neutron scattering, the following observations are made: (a) In semicrystalline nylons the glass transition of the mobile-amorphous phase is broadened to higher temperature. The additionally present rigid-amorphous phase, RAF, undergoes a separate, broad glass transition at somewhat higher temperature. (b) The transition of the RAF, in turn, overlaps usually with an increase in large-amplitude motion of the CH2-groups within the crystals and latent heat effects due to melting, recrystallization, and crystal annealing. (c) Above the glass transitions of the two non-crystalline phases, C p of the crystals approaches and exceeds that of the melt. This effect is due to additional entropy contributions (disordering) within the crystals, which may for some nylons lead to a mesophase. In case a mesophase is formed, the C p drops to the level of the melt as is common for mesophases. (d) Some locally reversible melting is present on the crystal surfaces, but seems to be minimal for the mesophase. (e) The increasing amount of large-amplitude motion in the crystals is described as a third glass transition, occurring over a broad temperature range below the melting or disordering transition from crystal to mesophase. The assumption of a separate glass transition in ordered phases was previously discovered on analyzing aliphatic poly(oxide)s such as poly(oxyethylene), POE, and in the broad class of mesophase-forming small and large molecules. To attain a full description of the globally-metastable, semicrystalline phase-structure of nylons and to understand its properties, one needs quantitative information about the glass transitions of the two non-crystalline phases and that of the crystal, as well as the various irreversible and locally reversible order/disorder transitions and their kinetics. Finally, with different substitutions in the α-position of the backbone structure of nylon 2, one describes poly(amino acid)s which on proper copolymerization yield proteins. This links the present study to the earlier thermal analyses of all naturally occurring poly(amino acid)s, a number of copoly(amino acid)s, and globular proteins in their dehydrated states. It will be of importance to check by quantitative thermal analysis if similar glass transitions and phase structures as seen in the aliphatic nylons are also present in the poly(amino acid)s to possibly gain new information about the nanophase structure of proteins. },

At social dances in Los Angeles, she noticed that Africans had a distinctive aura as they danced. Why? Preparing for African fieldwork, she sought theoretical grounding in the dance therapy field. Yet, aesthetic and psychological theories insufficiently explained her half-century dance experience. Dance research in Nigeria and Uganda, an American elementary school, American theaters, social dance settings, and adult entertainment clubs also resonated with political science, anthropology and sociolinguistics. In addition, the nonverbal communication field and cognitive science explorations of the mind-body interface helped to explain the persuasive dance communication she saw in practice. Findings of how, what, to and with whom dance speaks have implications for dance therapy and its broader acceptance in the health field and wider population. },

  abstract={ We present a technique to quantify and model the intensity of structural changes produced by management of dry grazing lands at a landscape scale. The technique is illustrated with the analysis of digitized black–white (b/w) imagery and an application to the study of changes induced by grazing gradients. Structural changes in patchy vegetation canopies were studied in the Patagonian Monte (Chubut, Argentina) at two resolution scales by means of linear transects in the field (50 m) and others drawn on aerial b/w photographs (2–5 km) of grazed paddocks. Spatial series of plant cover values along transects in the field and on photographs were analyzed with standard techniques of spectral analyses, including auto-correlation spectra and Fourier transforms. In order to test the internal consistency of the techniques used, synthetic plant canopies with patches of varying cover and size were generated by means of a stochastic model of plant growth under different stocking rates or after varying periods of recovery. The behavior of the simulation model is consistent with the observed dynamics of plant canopies in semiarid environments. There is a consistent relation between the number and geometric properties of plant patches (patch number, patch size, patch connectivity) and the signal/noise ratios of the Fourier decomposition describing plant density data. Signal/noise ratios corresponding to plant cover data in paddocks with different grazing treatment are consistent with the assumptions derived from modeled canopies, as well as those estimated from optical density of b/w aerial photographs of paddocks. We tested the hypotheses that patch arrangements as quantified by the signal/noise ratios vary in accordance with grazing gradients in paddocks with a permanent corner-located watering point. The use of digitized b/w images allows inspecting permanent changes over time periods when other types of images were not yet available. },

Deary and colleagues discuss why, despite its high heritability, the molecular underpinnings of intelligence remain elusive, and show that variations in the structure and efficiency of brain pathways might contribute to intelligence differences. Neuroscience is contributing to an understanding of the biological bases of human intelligence differences. This work is principally being conducted along two empirical fronts: genetics — quantitative and molecular — and brain imaging. Quantitative genetic studies have established that there are additive genetic contributions to different aspects of cognitive ability — especially general intelligence — and how they change through the lifespan. Molecular genetic studies have yet to identify reliably reproducible contributions from individual genes. Structural and functional brain-imaging studies have identified differences in brain pathways, especially parieto-frontal pathways, that contribute to intelligence differences. There is also evidence that brain efficiency correlates positively with intelligence. },

  abstract={ The multiple intelligences are familiar concepts to K-12 teachers and to many university professors, especially those in teacher education. The majority of educators have also heard of Daniel Goleman and the concept termed “emotional intelligence.” Emotional intelligence is rarely discussed as an important variable in the classroom, however, even though it has a profound influence on student learning. It should, therefore, inform decisions regarding the type and variety of instructional activities. Goleman’s (1995) research supports the claim that emotional intelligence, even more than IQ, is the most reliable predictor of success in school and in life. In this article, emotional intelligence is presented as the foundation for social skills—skills that students must possess to successfully work together collaboratively and in cooperative groups. Research conducted in U.S. classrooms indicates that the benefits of cooperative group learning depend on the quality of the interactions that occur. When the interactions are respectful and inclusive, more frequent use of small groups is associated with increases in academic and prosocial outcomes. When group interactions are disrespectful and inequitable, frequent use of groups is associated with reduced academic and prosocial outcomes. Linn, Lewis, Tsuchida, and Songer (2000) suggested that science education, as well as academic instruction of all kinds, should be studied in the larger context of students’ social and ethical development (i.e., responsibility, helpfulness, and the willingness and capacity to express disagreement respectfully); however, few reform efforts in the U.S. focus simultaneously on academic content, social development, and character development (Schaps, Watson, &amp; Lewis, 1997). },

  abstract={ Light regulates fungal development and behaviour and activates metabolic pathways. In addition, light is one of the many signals that fungi use to perceive and interact with the environment. In the ascomycete Neurospora crassa blue light is perceived by the white collar (WC) complex, a protein complex formed by WC-1 and WC-2. WC-1 is a protein with a flavin-binding domain and a zinc-finger domain, and interacts with WC-2, another zinc-finger domain protein. The WC complex operates as a photoreceptor and a transcription factor for blue-light responses in Neurospora. Proteins similar to WC-1 and WC-2 have been described in other fungi, suggesting a general role for the WC complex as a fungal receptor for blue light. The ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans uses red light perceived by a fungal phytochrome as a signal to regulate sexual and asexual development. In addition, other photoreceptors, rhodopsins and cryptochromes, have been identified in fungi, but their functional relevance has not been elucidated. The investigation of fungal light responses provides an opportunity to understand how fungi perceive the environment and to identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation by light of cellular development and metabolism. },

  abstract={ This paper introduces a concept called task muddiness as a metric for higher intelligence. Task muddiness is meant to be inclusive and expendable in nature. The intelligence required to execute a task is measured by the composite muddiness of the task described by multiple muddiness factors. The composite muddiness explains why many challenging tasks are muddy and why autonomous mental development is necessary for muddy tasks. It facilitates better understanding of intelligence, what the human adult mind can do, and how to build a machine to acquire higher intelligence. The task-muddiness indicates a major reason why a higher biological mind is autonomously developed from autonomous, simple-to-complex experience. The paper also discusses some key concepts that are necessary for understanding the mind and intelligence, such as intelligence metrics, the mode a task is conveyed to the task executor, a human and a machine being a joint task performer in the traditional artificial intelligence (AI), a developmental agent (human or machine) being a sole task performer, and the need for autonomy in task-nonexplicit learning. },

Variations in intelligence and brain structure are heritable, but are also influenced by factors such as education, family environment and environmental hazards. Cognitive, psychometric, genetic and neuroimaging studies are converging, and the emergence of mechanistic models of intelligence is inevitable. These exciting scientific advances encourage renewed responsiveness to the social and ethical implications of conducting such research. },

  abstract={ Blackspot bruise susceptibility of potato tubers of the cultivar Oleva increased during growth but was stable during storage independent of the type of impact method employed. With the pendulum test method, blackspots were observed in the tubers of the cultivar Dali during the final growth period and early in the storage period, whereas no blackspots were observed when they were treated on a shaking table. The relationships between blackspot susceptibility and dry matter content, size of starch granules, concentration of N, K, Mg and Ca, membrane leakiness and turgor pressure in the tuber cortices fluctuated according to cultivar, developmental stage of the tuber and the test method employed. The study underlines the importance of choosing a test method, which closely simulates the impact conditions of commercial situations, since the relationships between blackspot susceptibility and various physiological parameters of the tuber were found to change according to the impact condition employed. },

  abstract={ Admission to gifted programs involves identification, which entails theories of intelligence. Unfortunately, limited resources and space availability often take precedence over theory and educational philosophy in the admission process. Three selective gifted programs are used as examples of how theories of intelligence, driven by individual program philosophies, can be used as bases of admission within the practical limitations of each. The Cisco A. Carter Gifted Early Education Program identifies inner-city preschoolers for both general intelligence and specific skills. The Julliard Pre-College Program selects participants based on a specific skill. Hunter College Elementary School screens for general intellectual giftedness. Issues such as age of identification, underrepresented populations, and gifted children with diverse abilities and needs also are addressed. },

The first section of this article provides an overview of the research areas of emotional intelligence, social and emotional learning, and character education; it further examines how these areas became linked in the popular press. The second section examines the scientific evidence for whether emotional intelligence underpins social and emotional learning, how emotional intelligence relates to success, and whether it is central to character. We conclude that educational policy in this area has outpaced the science on which it is ostensibly based, and recommendations for the future are made. },

Parents also rated their children’s intelligence (339 parents; 205 mothers; age: M = 46.66). With and without controlling for intelligence, boys rated their numerical, figural, and reasoning abilities higher than girls. The same pattern appeared in parental intelligence perceptions. Boys even judged themselves as more intelligent controlling for both measured intelligence and parental intelligence estimates. Thus, neither intelligence nor gender-stereotypical parental perceptions totally explains boys’ stronger confidence in their intelligence. },

  abstract={ The purpose of the present study was to examine the relations among resting frontal brain electrical activity (EEG) (hypothesized to reflect a predisposition to positive versusnegative affect and ability to regulate emotions), emotional intelligence, and externalizing behaviors in a sample of non-clinical 10-year-old children. We found that boys had significantly lower emotional intelligence than girls, and low emotional intelligence was associated with significantly more externalizing behaviors (i.e., aggression and delinquency), replicating previous work. We also found that children with higher reported externalizing behaviors exhibited significantly greater relative right frontal EEG activity at rest compared with children with little to no externalizing behavioral problems. There was, however, no relation between emotional intelligence and the pattern of resting frontal EEG activity. Thus, emotional intelligence and the pattern of frontal EEG activation at rest are independent predictors of externalizing behaviors in children. Findings also suggest that individual differences in emotional intelligence may not be based on differences in levels of emotional regulation or the generation of positive affect as reflected in frontal EEG asymmetries, but rather other social and cognitive competencies required for adaptive behavior },

  abstract={ The aims of this paper are threefold: To show that game-playing (GP), the discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerned with the development of automated game players, has a strong epistemological relevance within both AI and the vast area of cognitive sciences. In this context games can be seen as a way of securely reducing (segmenting) real-world complexity, thus creating the laboratory environment necessary for testing the diverse types and facets of intelligence produced by computer models. This paper aims to promote the belief that games represent an excellent tool for the project of computational psychology (CP).  To underline how, despite this, GP has mainly adopted an engineering-inspired methodology and in doing so has distorted the framework of cognitive functionalism. Many successes (i.e. chess, checkers) have been achieved refusing human-like reasoning. The AI has appeared to work well despite ignoring an intrinsic motivation, that of creating an explanatory link between machines and mind.  To assert that substantial improvements in GP may be obtained in the future only by renewed interest in human-inspired models of reasoning and in other cognitive studies. In fact, if we increase the complexity of games (from NP-Completeness to AI-Completeness) in order to reproduce real-life problems, computer science techniques enter an impasse. Many of AI’s recent GP experiences can be shown to validate this.  The lack of consistent philosophical foundations for cognitive AI and the minimal philosophical commitment of AI investigation are two of the major reasons that play an important role in explaining why CP has been overlooked. },

The X-ray emission in the soft X-ray region was observed to increase to about 1.8 times and 2.3 times in carbon foam and Pt-doped foam, respectively with respect to solid carbon. In hard X-rays, there was no measurable difference amongst the carbon foam, Pt-doped carbon foam and solid carbon.

I first review the Eastern view of intelligence and its relation to consciousness. I argue that the study of consciousness has been accepted in Western psychology as a legitimate topic since William James, then present further discussion on the topic from Hindu and Buddhist philosophies. In essence, it is about awareness and the means of achieving a pure state of awareness through self-directed attention to internal thoughts, rather than external objects. The validity of a first-person observation of consciousness then becomes an important issue as well as the question of a non-physical mind. The paper concludes that using introspective reflection as a tool to explore consciousness is supported by both views. },

Despite this, there has been a great deal of uncertainty about methods for developing creative thinking abilities in design and technology students. However, the results of research from cognitive psychology, engineering and invention suggest some promising strategies for application in design and technology classes. Moreover, these strategies are emerging during a time when issues concerning ethics and values are also being raised. This paper presents a brief summary of the research into problem-solving and design. It then explores a range of creative thinking strategies, and of their possible applications in design, and goes on to argue that the strategies and settings that promote creative thinking in design and technology make the area not only one that is suitable for addressing ethics and values, but that it may be one of the major reasons for including design and technology programs in school curricula. },

Objective: To investigate the prevalence, severity and impact of chronic pain amongst spinal cord injury (SCI) patients in our region, and assess the need for additional resources to address the problem. Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to 216 spinal cord injury patients (10% of the Yorkshire regional spinal injury database). Setting: Yorkshire region, UK. Results: A response was received from 67% of the patients. Seventy-nine per cent of patients said they presently suffered with pain, with 39% describing it as severe. Comparison of pain and non-pain groups using chi-squared analysis showed that complete injury was significantly more likely than incomplete injury to result in chronic pain (P&lt;0.05), and increased severity of pain (P&lt;0.05). 43% of patients with pain said they required further treatment for it. Chronic pain had a significant impact on daily activities and was a major factor in causing unemployment (18%) and depression (39%). Conclusion: The study confirms that pain is a major problem in SCI patients which is not currently being adequately addressed. A multidisciplinary approach to management and prospective studies of treatments are required in order to reduce the prevalence and severity of pain in these patients. },

In the dielectric spectrum was observed a moderate shift of the peak of the α-relaxation and a broadening of the spectrum. The crystallization at that temperature is explained with a simple model of the transformed volume fraction based on steady-state homogeneous nucleation of crystallites which grow at a constant rate.

The energy and time-of-arrival of gamma rays in any detector can be determined accurately. Many experimental difficulties related to electronics are eliminated; the number of detectors can be increased with no increase in complexity of the apparatus; coincidences among any two detectors are measurable; and coincidences separated by as little as a ns are detectable in principle within one detector.

The Family and Medical Leave Act also covers most workers, and there has been very little research concerning the effects of FMLA legislation on employment. One hitherto neglected research area in both workers' compensation and FMLA is claim contagion. That is, as a claim is filed within a workgroup, does this increase the likelihood that others within the same workgroup will also file claims? We find the answer to be yes. We also find that this contagion effect is subject to diminishing returns to scale, however, in the sense that the claims probability increases at a decreasing rate as fellow employees' claims frequency increases. We argue that this is consistent with a model in which workers learn about filing a workers' compensation or FMLA claim from other workers. },

  abstract={ Fibrous proteins found in natural materials such as silk fibroins, spider silks, and viral spikes increasingly serve as a source of inspiration for the design of novel, artificial fibrous materials. The fiber protein from the adenovirus has previously served as a model for the design of artificial, self-assembling fibers. The fibrous shaft of this protein consists of 15-amino-acid sequence repeats that fold into a triple β-spiral motif in their native context. Recombinant proteins based on multimers of simplified consensus shaft repeats were previously reported to form self-assembling fibrils from which filaments could be spun. Here, we describe the structural characterization of these fibrils; X-ray fiber diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Congo Red binding strongly suggest an amyloid-type structure for these fibrils, with β-strands arranged perpendicular to the fibril axis. This amyloid structure is distinct from the native β-spiral fold, and similar to amyloid structures formed by short, synthetic peptides corresponding to shaft sequences. We discuss implications for the rational design of novel fibrous materials, based on crystal structure information and knowledge of folding and assembly pathways of natural fibrous proteins. },

Results suggest that genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental influences have an impact on intelligence and academic achievement. Behavioral genetic studies also suggest that the importance of genes may vary as a function of age. Other studies suggest that genes drive the correlation and that the nonshared environment drives the discrepancy between measures of intelligence and achievement. Implications for the identification of intellectually and academically relevant environmental influences are discussed. },

  abstract={ The east coast forest fires of April 2000 were Korea’s largest recorded fires. This, along with the fact that they took place in the region most frequently affected by fire, attracted a great deal of attention. Due to the variations in wind, topography and pre-fire forest stands, a heterogeneous landscape mosaic of burn severity was created across the region. It turned out to be an excellent opportunity to study various landscape-scale impacts of fires on forest dynamics. Therefore, we investigated stands in the 23 794 ha of burned forest region, in terms of burn severity, vegetation regeneration and forested landscape change as a measure of community stability. Using the geographic information system technique, we analyzed the differential severity and post-fire recovery of pre-fire forest types of different stand age both at stand and species level. Analysis showed that pre-fire vegetation was composed of mainly pine (Pinus densiflora) stands that occupied 70% of the whole forested area, while pine-hardwood and hardwood stands occupied only 28% and 3%, respectively. In addition, two-thirds of all stands were less than 30-years-old. Pine stands were the most severely burned, while conversely pine-hardwood and hardwood stands were less vulnerable. This implied that pine forests had fire-prone characteristics. Vegetation recovery went the opposite way; that is, the regenerating vegetation cover was 71% at pre-fire hardwood stands, and 65% and 53% at pine-hardwood and pine stands, respectively. However, these recovery rates were strikingly fast, considering that investigation took place about 3 months after the fires. Fire did not initiate successional processes, but tended to accelerate the predicted successional changes by releasing pre-fire understory species that survived the fires and regenerated by sprouting. The dominant pre-fire tree species (P. densiflora) was susceptible to fire and not resilient enough to reestablish in competition with oak species. Contrary to pines, the abilities of oak species, mainly Quercus mongolica and Q. variabilis, to survive fires and to resprout vigorously made them dominant at most post-fire stands. These shifts in species abundance caused drastic changes to the landscape: from pine-dominated to oak-dominated stands without any notable change in species composition. The patterns in forest regeneration that we observed in Korea may be representative of forest responses to any long-term repeated disturbances, including fire. },

  abstract={ Individual differences in intelligence (cognitive abilities) are a prominent aspect of human psychology, and play a substantial role in influencing important life outcomes. Their phenotypic structure—as described by the science of psychometrics—is well understood and well replicated. Approximately half of the variance in a broad range of cognitive abilities is accounted by a general cognitive factor (g), small proportions of cognitive variance are caused by separable broad domains of mental function, and the substantial remainder is caused by variance that is unique to highly specific cognitive skills. The heritability of g is substantial. It increases from a low value in early childhood of about 30%, to well over 50% in adulthood, which continues into old age. Despite this, there is still almost no replicated evidence concerning the individual genes, which have variants that contribute to intelligence differences. Here, we describe the human intelligence phenotype, summarise the evidence for its heritability, provide an overview of and comment on molecular genetic studies, and comment on future progress in the field. },

  abstract={ The intake of food and drink can influence brain functions, which in turn may have effects on mental state and performance. Therefore, in principle claims to improve mood or specific aspects of cognitive performance by the consumption of functional foods are possible and indeed are currently found on the market. The paper reviews existing methodologies, which may be used to substantiate and validate such claims of desirable effects of foods on mental state and performance. Mood, arousal, activation, vigilance, attention, sleep, motivation, effort, perception, memory and intelligence have been identified as relevant aspects of mental state and performance. The basic scientific concepts within this field as well as the methodologies to measure these concepts have been reviewed and described. From this review it is concluded that, in principle, the phenomena in these fields are no different to those in other fields of life science. The scientific methods and protocols described in this report can positively demonstrate the effects of foods on mental state and performance in a scientifically valid way. A claim on mental state and performance like other claims must be based on scientific evidence. This report confirms that methodologies do exist to generate sound scientific evidence in this area. Therefore, claims on the enhancement of specific mental functions can and should be substantiated and validated using the methodologies described in this review. },

However, further exploration is required before links among cognitive style, performance, and other aspects of learners’ experience are more clearly understood. This study explores the relationship among cognitive style, performance, gender, and communication in a particular educational setting. The sample consisted of 145 new computer-systems students at the beginning of a program of study in their first year of higher education. Participants completed the “Cognitive Style Index” (Allinson &amp; Hayes, 1996) and provided additional demographic data, including gender and recent academic performance. Qualitative information about learning expectations was also sought. Findings show a significant relationship between performance and cognitive style. Students whose cognitive style scores indicate a preference for analytical thinking are significantly more likely to have entered university with above average performance scores than those with a preference for intuition. A significant relationship was also identified between cognitive style and types of qualitative statements used to describe learning expectations. The educational implications of these findings are explored and discussed. },

We study its local and global solvability and the asymptotic behavior of solutions (in terms of the global attractors). The parabolic regularization technique is used in this paper which allows us to extend the strong regularity properties and estimates of solutions of the fourth order parabolic approximations onto their third order limit—the generalized Korteweg–de Vries–Burgers (KdVB) equation. For initial data in $${H^2(\mathbb{R})}$$ we study the notion of viscosity solutions to KdVB, while for the larger $${H^1(\mathbb{R})}$$ phase space we introduce weak solutions to that problem. Finally, thanks to our general assumptions on the nonlinear term f guaranteeing that the global attractor is usually nontrivial (i.e., not reduced to a single stationary solution), we study an upper semicontinuity property of the family of global attractors corresponding to parabolic regularizations when the regularization parameter $${\epsilon}$$ tends to 0+ (which corresponds the passage to the KdVB equation). },

Although these behaviors may match items on the symptom lists for various disorders, a therapist must first consider the origin and context of those behaviors for an individual child through a non-pathological lens. This paper proposes a framework for understanding the behavior of difficult children based on core issues rather than diagnostic symptoms: arousal/excitability, range of focus, perfectionism, intensity, interpersonal sensitivity, sensory sensitivity, cognitive/perceptual style, perception of time, reaction style, and affiliation/integrity. Each trait is examined from two perspectives: how it can lead to or be interpreted as a problem, and how a therapist can re-frame the trait and build on it to identify effective interventions. This approach affirms children’s strengths and upholds social work values. },

  abstract={ This article reviews past empirical studies on the use of audio podcast (hereby referred to as podcast) in K-12 and higher education settings. Using the constant comparative method, this review is organized into three major research areas or topics: (a) participants’ podcast usage profile, (b) effects of podcast on learners’ outcomes, and (b) institutional aspects. Findings suggest that the most common use of podcasting is limited to either instructors distributing podcast recordings of lectures or supplementary materials for students to review subject material at their own time and place. A majority of the previous studies were descriptive, and were conducted in higher education and traditional course settings. Students generally enjoy using podcast, and tend to listen to the podcasts at home using desktop computers, rather than on the move (e.g., commuting to school) with a mobile device. Probably the main benefit of podcasting is that it allows students to listen to specific material that they missed or did not understand multiple times. The availability of podcast does not appear to encourage students to skip classes. We also discuss limitations of previous empirical studies, and provide some directions for future research related to the use of podcast in education settings. },

The intervention, located in Hartford Connecticut, served 114 African-Caribbean and Latino high school youth in a community education setting and a matched comparison group of 202 youth from 2001 to 2004. The strategy used in YARP begins with individuals, forges group identity and cohesion, trains youth as a group to use research to understand their community better (formative community ethnography), and then engages them in using the research for social action at multiple levels in community settings (policy, school-based, parental etc.) Engagement in community activism has, in turn, an effect on individual and collective efficacy and individual behavioral change. This approach is unique insofar as it differs from multilevel interventions that create approaches to attack multiple levels simultaneously. We describe the YARP intervention and employ qualitative and quantitative data from the quasi-experimental evaluation study design to assess the way in which the YARP approach empowered individual youth and groups of youth (youth networks) to engage in social action in their schools, communities and at the policy level, which in turn affected their attitudes and behaviors. },

Setting: A dental teaching hospital in the UK, 2002. Subjects and Methods: Subjects selected from the undergraduate population of a 5-year dental degree course. A questionnaire survey was carried out to determine the EI scores of the subjects. In each year of study, subjects were divided into low and high EI groups at the median score. From each EI group in each year, one male and one female subject were recruited. Data collection Unstructured face-to-face interviews. Data analysis Transcribing, sifting, indexing and charting data according to key themes. Results: 10 males and 10 females with low and high EI, representing all 5 years of study were interviewed. The experience of stress, expressed in emotional terms, ranged from anger and frustration to hatred. Four sets of coping strategies, adopted at varying degrees according to EI, were identified. High EI students were more likely to adopt reflection and appraisal, social and interpersonal, and organisation and time-management skills. Low EI students were more likely to engage in health-damaging behaviours. Conclusions: Future research needs to establish whether the enhancement of EI in dental students would lead to improved stress-coping, and better physical and psychological health. },

  abstract={ The quality of the educational experience for students may be at risk if they are not taught in ways that are effective and pertinent. While educational institutions (administrators, faculty senates or a combination) may try to compel faculty members to gain knowledge of and utilize up-to-date learning and instructional design strategies, these faculty members may baulk at this mandate, citing academic freedom as their right to design their courses in any way they see fit. Following is a discussion exploring the issue, suggesting that regardless of how academic freedom is interpreted, faculty members have an ethical obligation to deliver instruction in ways that do not violate students' rights to learn. Consequently, institutions have a right as well as a duty to compel their faculty members to follow through with this obligation. },

  abstract={ Partitioning a data set of attributed graphs into clusters arises in different application areas of structural pattern recognition and computer vision. Despite its importance, graph clustering is currently an underdeveloped research area in machine learning due to the lack of theoretical analysis and the high computational cost of measuring structural proximities. To address the first issue, we introduce the concept of metric graph spaces that enables central (or center-based) clustering algorithms to be applied to the domain of attributed graphs. The key idea is to embed attributed graphs into Euclidean space without loss of structural information. In addressing the second issue of computational complexity, we propose a neural network solution of the K-means algorithm for structures (KMS). As a distinguishing feature to improve the computational time, the proposed algorithm classifies the data graphs according to the principle of elimination of competition where the input graph is assigned to the winning model of the competition. In experiments we investigate the behavior and performance of the neural KMS algorithm. },

  abstract={ Childhood IQ and adult morbidity and mortality are known to be linked even beyond socioeconomic variables. Yet, their interrelations are insufficiently understood. It has been suggested that bodily sensations play a fundamental role in health-related self-regulation and that intelligence can influence the information processing of these somatic signals. This assumption is supported by reports on the influence of IQ on the exteroceptive (e.g. visual and auditory) and interoceptive (e.g. autonomic nervous system and posture) perception and processing of somatic information. Based on these findings the hypothesis of Psychosomatic Intelligence (PI) is introduced as an additional conceptual framework to probe the link between childhood IQ and adult health status. It implies a specific cognitive ability concerning the perception, interpretation, and self-regulation of bodily sensations. In this model, somatic signals are considered to reflect both intra-individual processes and individual-environment interactions. Based on this hypothesis the influence of intelligence on cognitive efforts to self-regulate somatic phenomena is amenable to systematic testing. },

  abstract={ A connection has long been made between music and moral education. Recent discussions have focused on concerns that certain lyrics can lead to acceptance of violence, suicide, inappropriate views of women, and other unethical behaviour. Debate over whether such connections exist at least illustrates that popular songs engage listeners with ethical issues; this arises from the unique blend of emotional and cognitive reactions to music. And while the emotional side of ethics has received less attention than other aspects of ethics, it is important and music can be a powerful and unique tool to introduce the emotional aspects of ethics. Music appeals to almost everyone. Throughout history songs have rallied people to action and drawn people into deeper reflection. Music engages our emotions, our imagination and our intellect. Students already spend many hours listening to songs, some of which address ethical issues; it is thus an ideal pedagogic aid in teaching subjects like ethics. This article will discuss how carefully selected songs can encourage thoughtful reflection and critical thinking about ethical issues: a number of specific examples will be described, along with a discussion of the general practicalities of using popular songs in teaching ethics and a demonstration of how students learn to listen critically and actively reflect on the ethical messages they receive. The enjoyment of music helps to engage students with ethics and its relevance for their lives and careers. This article aims to share some of the excitement and enthusiasm that popular songs have brought to my teaching of ethics. },

The two types vary in terms of the extent to which the conclusions resulting from the research are generalizable or contextually specific. This article describes developmental research in terms of the traditional stages of planning, conducting, and reporting a research project—problem definition, literature reviews, and research procedures. Examples of adapting a literature review to a developmental study are identified. Problem definition procedures encompass focusing on and framing the problem, and identifying the limitations of the research. Research procedures are adapted to developmental studies, particularly with respect to identifying the study’s participants, creating a research design, and collecting and analyzing the data. Finally, issues with respect to reporting developmental research are discussed. },

  abstract={ Discerning the motives that lead businesspeople to make ethical decisions in economic contexts is important, for it aids the moral evaluation of such decisions. But conventional economic theory has for too long assumed an egoist model of motivation, to which many contrast an altruist view of ethical choices. The result is to see business decision making as implying dilemmas. On the other hand, we argue, if one assumes multiple motives, economic and ethical, in ordinary business decisions, a more fruitful model of ethical motivation in such decisions emerges. In this paper multiple motives are assumed to be the norm in a world of large organizations, complex decisions and stakeholder management. An example of a technology acquisition decision, with environmental overtones is presented in illustration of this approach. A method for discerning motives, primarily in terms of behavioural efficacy is presented. On this basis a two step approach to morally evaluating mixed motives in business decisions is proposed. First, the fit of motives with substantive ethical values should be ascertained, and then the efficacy of moral motives in yielding ethical behaviour and outcomes should be determined. This approach, we conclude, offers a much more concrete model of the actual role of moral motives in business decision making. It also signals the importance of moral learning in organizations. },

  abstract={ Despite the ubiquity and importance of metaphor in thought and communication, its neural mediation remains elusive. We suggest that this uncertainty reflects, in part, stimuli that have not been designed with recent conceptual frameworks in mind or that have been hampered by inadvertent differences between metaphoric and literal conditions. In this article, we begin addressing these shortcomings by developing a large, flexible, extensively normed, and theoretically motivated set of metaphoric and literal sentences. On the basis of the results of three norming studies, we provide 280 pairs of closely matched metaphoric and literal sentences that are characterized along 10 dimensions: length, frequency, concreteness, familiarity, naturalness, imageability, figurativeness, interpretability, valence, and valence judgment reaction time. In addition to allowing for control of these potentially confounding lexical and sentential factors, these stimuli are designed to address questions about the role of novelty, metaphor type, and sensory-motor grounding in determining the neural basis of metaphor comprehension.

The assessment of contextual competence was based on youth self-reports of involvement, performance, and relationship quality in the peer, school, athletic, employment, religious, and cultural contexts. A principal components analysis of these engagement indices revealed the six expected components with the addition of a component labeled “self-in-context.” To identify holistic, multidimensional profiles of contextual competence, scores along the seven domains were cluster analyzed. Nine clusters emerged, each representing a distinct constellation of youth experience. Profiles were associated with demographic variables and youth adjustment. Profiles reflecting high engagement in two or more contexts predicted higher self-esteem and lower depression. In contrast, profiles marked by high engagement in the contexts of athletics or employment predicted more serious delinquency.

  abstract={ This paper is the second of two parts and continues the conversation which had called for a shift in the conceptual focus of science education towards philosophy of education, with the requirement to develop a discipline-specific “philosophy” of science education. In Part I, conflicting conceptions of science literacy were identified with disparate “visions” tied to competing research programs as well as school-based curricular paradigms. The impasse in the goals of science education and thereto, the contending views of science literacy, were themselves associated with three underlying fundamental aims of education (knowledge-itself; personal development; socialization) which, it was argued, usually undercut the potential of each other. During periods of “crisis-talk” and throughout science educational history these three aims have repeatedly attempted to assert themselves. The inability of science education research to affect long-term change in classrooms was correlated not only to the failure to reach a consensus on the aims (due to competing programs and to the educational ideologies of their social groups), but especially to the failure of developing true educational theories (largely neglected since Hirst). Such theories, especially metatheories, could serve to reinforce science education’s growing sense of academic autonomy and independence from socio-economic demands. In Part II, I offer as a suggestion Egan’s cultural-linguistic theory as a metatheory to help resolve the impasse. I hope to make reformers familiar with his important ideas in general, and more specifically, to show how they can complement HPS rationales and reinforce the work of those researchers who have emphasized the value of narrative in learning science. },

Objectives: To assess the prevalence and characteristics of pain and dysesthesia in a community based sample of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) with special focus on neuropathic pain. Setting: Community. Western half of Denmark. Methods: We mailed a questionnaire to all outpatients (n=436) of the Viborg rehabilitation centre for spinal cord injury. The questionnaire contained questions regarding cause and level of spinal injury and amount of sensory and motor function below this level. The words pain and unpleasant sensations were used to describe pain (P) and dysesthesia (D) respectively. Questions included location and intensity of chronic pain or dysesthesia, degree of interference with daily activity and sleep, presence of paroxysms and evoked pain or dysesthesia, temporal aspects, alleviating and aggravating factors, McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and treatment. Results: Seventy-six per cent of the patients returned the questionnaire, (230 males and 100 females). The ages ranged from 19 to 80 years (median 42.6 years) and time since spinal injury ranged from 0.5 to 39 years (median 9.3 years). The majority (&gt;75%) of patients had traumatic spinal cord injury. Of the respondents, 77% reported having pain or unpleasant sensations, and 67% had chronic pain or unpleasant sensations at or below lesion. Forty-eight per cent reported that P/D could be evoked by non-noxious stimulation of the skin indicating that allodynia is present in almost half of the patients. Forty-three per cent of respondents took analgesics, 7% received antidepressants or anticonvulsants. Conclusion: This survey suggests that pain and dysesthesia are common and serious complaints in SCI patients. Unexpectedly, only 7% of the patients were treated with drugs considered to be most effective in neuropathic pain. This emphasizes the need for a continued research and education on P/D in SCI.

  abstract={ The Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) is an Iberian endemism considered threatened both in Portugal and Spain. This vole is often referred to as a tall perennial grassland community specialist. However, a recent study revealed that the Cabrera vole exploits a wide variety of grasslands in south Portugal. The major aim of the present study was to test the palatability of 21 plant species of this region occurring within or outside typical perennial grassland colonies in order to assess vole’s food preferences. Results showed a major consumption of monocotyledons and annual plants (such as Festuca ampla, Agrostis castellana, Brachypodium distachyon, B. phoenicoides and Vulpia geniculata), but no relationship was found between diet selection and perennial grassland plant communities. The preference of voles for annual species, occurring more abundantly outside the colonies, raises the hypothesis that the establishment of a colony might be determined by plant species abundance and persistence over the year, rather than by their palatability. This seems to be particularly evident in this region, where summer meteorological conditions make vegetation unavailable outside the colonies. },

  abstract={ It is widely believed that spatial scale affects habitat selection, and should influence management options, especially for species with wide geographic distribution or large territories. Eurasian badger habitat selection has been well studied throughout most of its European distribution range, but never at multiple spatial scales. We used compositional analysis to assess habitat selection of Eurasian badgers in southern Portugal at four spatial scales (1, 4, 25, and 100 km2). We assessed habitat use from setts, latrines and footprints presence, and road kills. Oak woodlands with understorey were selected at all scales, being the most preferred habitat at 3 scales (1, 4, and 100 km2). Pastures were most selected at the scale of the 25 km2 cell, but their use was not significantly different from oak woodland with understorey. Shrubs and pastures were also secondly important at the majority of scales. Contrary to findings at northern latitudes, deciduous forests decreased in importance as cell size increased. In the highly humanized and fragmented landscape of southern Portugal, Eurasian badgers are selecting the matrix of oak woodlands interspersed with patches of pastures, shrubs and riparian vegetation. In these oak woodlands, scale does not have a marked effect. Management for badgers should provide, for at least, 30% of oak woodland cover at all scales. Our study illustrates the across-scale importance of maintaining the historically human altered, sustainable and unique landscape and land use system — the montado. },

  abstract={ This paper is a reflection on the current policy moment in educational research in Australia in the context of globalisation. Set against a consideration of the emergent structure of feeling, the paper draws on three case studies of research to draw out some lessons for educational researchers and the research community. The argument is put that the dangerous ‘we’ of AARE needs to support increased funding for education and for educational research and, for the latter, to support a range of funding sources, types of research, methodologies and dissemination approaches. Increasingly there are pressures upon such eclecticism because of governmental attempts to ‘instrumentalise’ relationships between educational research and practitioner needs as perceived by governments. While such research is necessary, there is also a need within a democratic polity for research framed by agendas set by researchers that critiques government-directed developments. The paper argues there is a complex relationship amongst researchers and educational policy and pedagogical practitioners and as such the concept of ‘impact’ as applied to educational research requires substantial theorising. Contemporary research policy has tended to inhibit the dissemination of academic research to educational practitioners, while educational policy has tended, inappropriately in the argument of the paper, to construct teachers as the mere recipients of policy and research done elsewhere. },

The following stages have been examined: design of a basic system morphology, modification of the morphology, analysis, and planning. Our combinatorial approach (two-level hierarchical morphological design) consists of two problems: (i) multicriteria analysis of primitives (design alternatives), and (ii) combinatorial synthesis. The hierarchical combinatorial synthesis is based on a “design morphology” which corresponds to an initial hierarchical knowledge structure (design alternatives, their estimates, etc.). Ordinal scales for initial information are used. Two basic numerical examples illustrate the approach: (i) modular analysis, adaptation, and improvement of HCSs; (ii) series planning the user interfaces for knowledge engineering. },

We believe, indeed, that in this exact moment of human history, it becomes necessary to clarify with a strong theoretical paradigm what is the real relationship between machines and humans. Therefore, we propose to abandon the mental scheme by which intelligence is an exclusive prerogative of humans in order to embrace the idea that machines have started to express a real collaborative and/or competitive force, that they are able to produce ideation and inspiration, and to contribute to the wealth of ideas. },

In our work 3C SiC, 4H SiC and Si/a-SiC:H/SiO2 structures treated by various oxidation a passivation procedures are studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Surface roughness properties are studied by fractal geometry methods. The complexity of the analysed surface is sensitive to the oxidation and passivation steps and the proposed fractal complexity measure values enable quantification of the fine surface changes. We also determined the optical properties of oxidized and passivated samples by using visual modelling and stochastic optimization. },

  abstract={ This work was discussed on the morphology and crystal structure on electrospun fibrous PB membrane, namely, both highly porous PB film and the fibrous PB nonwoven prepared by the same method of electrospinning process. Both the tip-to-collector distance (TCD) and the surrounding temperature were crucial parameters for determining the resulting morphologies. In terms of shorter TCD (below 10 cm) and lower surrounding temperature (below 40 °C), highly porous PB film was almost electrospun because such shorter distance and lower temperature were completely not enough to evaporate the used solvents during electrospinning. Fibrous PB nonwoven, however, was obtained at longer TCD and higher temperature (80 °C). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analyses demonstrated that a porous PB film revealed two crystal structures of dominant form III and small amount of form II arising from the melt recrystallization from form III crystals, while fibrous PB nonwoven showed form I due to the aging time over 2 weeks at room temperature after electrospinning. As a result, it was found that PB membrane can exhibits a porous film and fibrous nonwoven with different morphologies and crystalline microstructures depending on TDC and surrounding temperature although they were prepared from the same method of electrospinning. },

Unfortunately, many of these educational reforms with good intentions and huge resources investment have been found ineffective and unsustainable if not totally failed.

To combat the perceived lack of corporate integrity, companies are stressing their probity. This stress is problematic because executives tend to instrumentalize the value of integrity. This paper argues that integrity needs to be better defined because the current mode of talking about the subject is misleading. The paper considers three traditions’ understanding of the idea of integrity, argues that integrity is intrinsically valuable, and concludes with some reflections on the way in which integrity, properly understood, functions as a business asset. },

Elementary preservice teachers frequently struggle to apply this knowledge to classroom decisions (Madsen, 2002, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the North Central Association for the Education of Teachers of Science, Bettendorf, IA). This study examined the effects of using a video case-analysis within an elementary science methods course focused on the development of a research-based framework. Students in two course sections completed a unit plan, and students in one section completed the video analysis. Video analysis students’ performance on an oral defense with the instructor was compared with oral defense performance from students in the unit plan group. Video analysis students outperformed their peers on questions related to how learning theories influence decisions of selecting content, explaining the use of questioning, and the use of self assessment strategies. Despite these differences, students in both groups still perceive teaching as primarily accomplished through activities and have difficulties understanding the critical role of the teacher in promoting student goals. This study raises issues regarding teachers’ knowledge development during preservice experiences. },

Twenty consecutive patients with symptomatic degenerative discs were treated with IDET and evaluated preoperatively, and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Pain was measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and function was evaluated with the Oswestry score and SF-36 questionnaire. The VAS scores improved by 14&nbsp;mm on average (P=0.046), but the individual scores show great variation. The Oswestry scores did not improve significantly. The SF-36 showed improvement, but only for the subscales vitality (P=0.023) and bodily pain (P=0.047). Based on these results, we conclude that IDET is not effective in reducing pain and improving functional performance in a sample of 20 patients treated for chronic discogenic low back pain after 6 months follow-up. },

  abstract={ Urbanization has profoundly transformed many landscapes throughout the world, and the ecological consequences of this transformation are yet to be fully understood. To understand the ecology of urban systems, it is necessary to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of urbanization, which often requires dynamic modeling and spatial analysis. In this paper, we describe an urban growth model, the Phoenix Urban Growth Model (PHX-UGM), illustrate a series of model calibration and evaluation methods, and present scenario-based simulation analyses of the future development patterns of the Phoenix metropolitan region. PHX-UGM is a spatially explicit urban landscape model and is a modified version of the Human-Induced Land Transformations (HILT) model originally developed for the San Francisco Bay Area. Using land use and other data collected for the Phoenix area, existing growth rules were selectively modified and new rules were added to help examine key ecological and social factors. We used multiple methods and a multi-scale approach for model calibration and evaluation. The results of the different evaluation methods showed that the model performed reasonably well at a certain range of spatial resolutions (120–480 m). When fine-scale data are available and when landscape structural details are desirable, the 120-m grain size should be used. However, at finer levels the noise and uncertainty in input data and the exponentially increased computational requirements would considerably reduce the usefulness and accuracy of the model. At the other extreme, model projections with too coarse a spatial resolution would be of little use at the local and regional scales. A series of scenario analyses suggest that the Metropolitan Phoenix area will soon be densely populated demographically and highly fragmented ecologically unless dramatic actions are to be taken soon to significantly slow down the population growth. Also, there will be an urban morphological threshold over which drastic changes in certain aspects of landscape pattern occur. Specifically, the scenarios indicate that, as large patches of open lands (including protected lands, parks and available desert lands) begin to break up, patch diversity declines due partly to the loss of agricultural lands, and the overall landscape shape complexity also decreases because of the predominance of urban lands. It seems that reaching such a threshold can be delayed, but not avoided, if the population in the Phoenix metropolitan region continues to grow. PHX-UGM can be used as a tool for exploring the outcome of different urban planning strategies, and the methods illustrated in this paper can be used for evaluating other urban models. },

Stable integration of the single Arabidopsis BCB/GUS gene into the tobacco genome resulted in strongly induced GUS activity upon wounding in the homozygous T2 plants. GUS gene expression was limited to the plant cells surrounding the wound site, showing localized induction. However, expression of the chimeric gene was delayed in time and reduced in intensity when compared with the response of BCB gene expression in Arabidopsis, suggesting that foreign gene promoter activity is reduced in the heterologous host },

Three scenarios for the future of public education are tested against these values, with only one offering an optimal balance. Nine domains of policy and practice are explored in the light of these values (curriculum, pedagogy, design, professionalism, funding, leadership, management, governance and boundary spanning).

The first is so attractive that the second refers to it to give more credibility to its questionable theories on intelligence. The point is that, during the 20th century, the bell curve has assumed a more and more important role in psychological research and practice and have become both a reality and a myth. In the first case (reality) we can assist to appropriate applications of a real useful statistical concept. In the second (myth) we can have two kinds of attitudes: one attitude is typical of those researchers who search for normality in all their data and variables, just as Parsifal used to search for the Holy Graal (we call this “the Parsifal attitude”); the other is typical of those researchers who give normality for granted and act as if it were a Platonic Idea (we call this “the Plato attitude”).

These contextual features can be seen as projections of the therapist's self and therefore useable in treatment. Through an interest in alternative brain functions due to her own struggles with a neurological illness, the author arrived at the idea of utilizing her personal interests which naturally come into the milieu as therapeutic vehicles. Personal interests that are compatible with the patient's character offer alternative modes for experiencing, expressing and regulating affect states. These interests in the expressive arts together with the person of the therapist constitute a medium for rotating attention around unfamiliar parts of the mental landscape. Disavowed or dissociated affects can be unearthed, made conscious, put into language, and treated. This idea in practice nests neatly within recent thinking in psychoanalysis, neuroscience, and the philosophy of science. When language alone is not enough to move the therapeutic process forward, other working knowledge in the therapist's life can be brought to bear as a powerful evocative force for therapeutic change. },

  abstract={ Plant responses to gradients and after disturbances are important because they help define key ecosystem functions, such as productivity and decomposition. In this article I review studies that have tended to examine these influences on plants separately, presenting an incomplete view of vegetation dynamics. I then present a conceptual model of interaction between gradients and disturbance focusing on the mechanisms of plant-plant replacement, which largely determine species composition, abundance, and dispersion and are often mediated by changes in resource availability. The model consists of mechanisms that are either interactive and dependent on the presence of the replacing species or noninteractive and driven by the relationship between changing resource conditions in patches and the life histories / ecotolerances of species. The model explores variation in mechanism strength among different disturbances defined primarily by severity (e.g., amount of biomass lost), among gradients that differ in temperature and precipitation, and among species of fundamentally differing life histories. The main assumption is that plants mainly respond to the most limited resource in a given gradient × disturbance situation, as dictated by the relative severity of the disturbance versus the relative severity of the gradient. Finally, I sketch a general theory of plant responses containing the testable hypotheses from the model and also including axioms, assumptions, and deductions arising from these components. },

To better understand the pathogenesis of isolated GKD, we sought individuals with point mutations in the GK coding region and measured their GK enzyme activities. We identified six individuals with missense mutations: four (N288D, A305V, M428T, and Q438R) among males who were asymptomatic and two (D198G, R405Q) in individuals who were symptomatic. GK activity measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines or fibroblasts was similar for the symptomatic and the asymptomatic individuals. Mapping of the individuals' missense mutations to the three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli GK revealed that the symptomatic individuals' mutations are in the same region as a subset of the mutations among the asymptomatic individuals, adjacent to the active-site cleft. We conclude that, like many other disorders, GK genotype does not predict GKD phenotype. We hypothesize that the phenotype of an individual with GKD is a complex trait influenced by additional, independently inherited genes. },

  abstract={ Nanotechnology is a broad and complex discipline that holds great promise for innovations that can benefit mankind. Yet, one must not overlook the wide array of factors involved in managing nanomaterial development, ranging from the technical specifications of the material to possible adverse effects in humans. Other opportunities to evaluate benefits and risks are inherent in environmental health and safety (EHS) issues related to nanotechnology. However, there is currently no structured approach for making justifiable and transparent decisions with explicit trade-offs between the many factors that need to be taken into account. While many possible decision-making approaches exist, we believe that multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a powerful and scientifically sound decision analytical framework for nanomaterial risk assessment and management. This paper combines state-of-the-art research in MCDA methods applicable to nanotechnology with a hypothetical case study for nanomaterial management. The example shows how MCDA application can balance societal benefits against unintended side effects and risks, and how it can also bring together multiple lines of evidence to estimate the likely toxicity and risk of nanomaterials given limited information on physical and chemical properties. The essential contribution of MCDA is to link this performance information with decision criteria and weightings elicited from scientists and managers, allowing visualization and quantification of the trade-offs involved in the decision-making process. },

The experimental support of the development and functioning of these models is provided by the function of thermal diffusivity, which describes the thermal diffusivity as a function of the water content and can be derived using the methods based on the solution of direct and inverse problems of heat transfer. On the basis of the different boundary conditions and sine-shaped daily and annual temperature cycles, a number of equations were proposed for calculating the thermal diffusivity that contained logarithms, arctangents of amplitudes, and the phase shift between the daily temperatures at two depths. A mean-integral solution was obtained for the estimation of the average temperature in a specific soil layer. A number of methods were developed starting from the analysis of the temperature dynamics on the basis of four daily observations at the same depth with 6-hour intervals, and nomograms were given for the rapid and simple calculation of the soil thermal diffusivity at a specific depth. The developed methods can be used for assessing the soil thermal diffusivity under natural conditions, which should improve the reliability, accuracy, and adequacy and expand the application range of predictive mathematical models for the thermal regime of soils. },

  abstract={ This article presents a provocative perspective on creativity with two controversial assertions. First, it challenges the conventional view of the creator as an innovative person, by promoting the notion of the dogmatic creator. Second, it argues that “nice” people are not creative, and creative people are not “nice.” An integrative review of the empirical literature on culture, creativity, and conflict ensues. In the process, four sets of hypotheses are developed which are embedded in two theoretical models of behavior. In Theoretical Model A, it is postulated that cultural individualism-collectivism has a positive causal impact on independent self-construal (Hypothesis 1A). In turn, independent self-construal is posited to have a positive causal impact on positive perception of conflict (Hypothesis 2A), confrontational conflict style (Hypothesis 3A), and creative behavior (Hypothesis 4A). In Theoretical Model B, it is postulated that cultural individualism-collectivism has a negative causal impact on interdependent self-construal (Hypothesis 1B). In turn, interdependent self-construal was postulated to have a positive causal impact on negative perception of conflict (Hypothesis 2B), non-confrontational conflict style (Hypothesis 3B), and conforming behavior (Hypothesis 4B). One-hundred-eighty-six university students in Singapore and 158 students in Australia responded to a survey, which consisted of various scales tapping the constructs in these two theoretical models of behavior. SEM analyses using LISREL 8.0 provided empirical support for both models of behavior. Based on these findings, several points are raised. First, creativity should not be perceived in a naïve manner. Second, there is an urgent need to assist parents, teachers, and employers to deal with creative individuals. Finally, since creativity is a cultural phenomenon, the cultural context must be made amenable for this type of behavior. },

I first present the ideas and arguments put forward by evolutionary psychologists that the mind evolved certain mental capacities as adaptive responses to environmental pressures. Specifically, Steven Mithen thinks that the mind has evolved cognitive fluidity, viz., an ability to exchange information flexibly between and among mental modules. Showing the deficiency in Mithen’s view, I then argue that the flexible exchange of information between and among modules together with scenario visualization is what explains the ability to construct the novel tools needed to survive and flourish in the environments in which our hominin ancestors resided. Finally, I trace the development of the multi-purposed javelin, from its meager beginnings as a stick, in order to illustrate scenario visualization in novel tool manufacturing. },

  abstract={ The aim of the series of papers is to discuss the application of Xenopus laevis, as model animal in biology, in ecotoxicology. X. laevis as model animal is wildly used in biological study and has provided a lot of relating data because of many advantages, such as living in water and being easily maintained, laying eggs in the whole year, and externally fertilizing and developing. Embryos and larvae of X. laevis like other amphibians are directly exposed in the aquatic environment and sensitive to pollutants. In addition, sex differentiation and sex organ development of X. laevis are sensitive to sex hormones and endocrine disruptors with sex hormone activities, which enable X. laevis to be used in studies on sex hormone disruption and reproductive toxicity of endocrine disruptors. Metamorphic development of X. laevis is very sensitive to thyroid hormones and thyroid disruptors, which enables X. laevis to be used for evaluating thyroid disruptors. Also, X. laevis ecotoxicology can be linked with amphibian population declines and malformed frog occurrence, being one of the hotspots in ecology. Thus, more and more laboratories have introduced X. laevis to ecotoxicological study. The quality of laboratory animals correlates with scientificity and reliability of results from animal experiments. It is especially important for toxicology. Quality control of X. laevis involving several factors such as water and food is discussed in this paper. },

  abstract={  A biolistic particle delivery system was used to genetically transform pollen tubes of three species of white pine (Pinus aristata, P. griffithii and P. monticola). The introduced plasmid DNA contained the GUS coding sequence flanked by the 35S CaMV promoter and NOS terminator sequences. Successful gene delivery was demonstrated by transient GUS expression as evaluated by standard histochemical assay. Distance of target specimens significantly influenced transient GUS expression in all three species of white pine. A target distance of 6 cm resulted in a significant number of transformed pollen tubes in P. aristata and P. griffithii, while distances of 6 and 9 cm resulted in a significant number of transformed pollen tubes in P. monticola. Generally, the number of pollen tubes expressing GUS activity was higher in P. aristata than in P. griffithii and P. monticola. The possibility of using GUS-transformed pollen tubes in conjunction with in vitro fertilization in conifers was examined. Gene expression in pollen tubes was also examined under electron microscopy where the X-glu reaction product occurred as large crystalline electron-dense precipitates in the cytoplasm. },

The perimeter-to-area ratio of the initial configuration proved to be an adequate determinant of expected time-to-extinction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the degree of aggregation is closely related to the local density dependence of the colonization functions. },

The transfer of a heating laser radiation was registered on the rear side of the target. It ranged from a level of ∼0.5% for the thickness of a low-density layer of 400 µm and density of 9 mg/cm3 (mass per unit square of 0.36 mg/cm2) up to 50–60% for a thickness of 100 µm and density of 2.25 mg/cm3 (mass per unit square of 0.02 mg/cm2). The time dependences of the optical emission from the rear side of the targets were measured. They appear to be indicative of the plasma dynamics in two-layer targets (polymer foam on Al foil) and enable the estimation of the absorption depth for the laser light in an undercritical plasma. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to predict quantitative changes in evaporation from bare soils in the Mediterranean climate region of Turkey in response to the projections of a regional climate model developed in Japan (hereafter RCM). Daily RCM data for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET r) and soil evaporation were obtained for the periods of 1994–2003 and 2070–2079. Potential evaporation (E p) from bare soils was calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation with a surface resistance of zero. Simulation of actual soil evaporation (E a) was carried out using Aydin model (Aydin et al., Ecological Modelling 182:91–105, 2005) combined with Aydin and Uygur (2006, A model for estimating soil water potential of bare fields. In Proceedings of the 18th International Soil Meeting (ISM) on Soils Sustaining Life on Earth, Managing Soil and Technology, Sanliurfa, 477–480pp.) model of predicting soil water potential at the top surface layer of a bare soil, after performances of Aydin model (R 2 = 94.0%) and Aydin and Uygur model (R 2 = 97.6) were tested. The latter model is based on the relations among potential soil evaporation, hydraulic diffusivity, and soil wetness, with some simplified assumptions. Input parameters of the model are simple and easily obtainable such as climatic parameters used to compute the potential soil evaporation, average diffusivity for the drying soil, and volumetric water content at field capacity. The combination of Aydin and Aydin and Uygur models appeared to be useful in estimating water potential of soils and E a from bare soils, with only a few parameters. Unlike ET r and E p projected to increase by 92 and 69&nbsp;mm (equivalent to 8.0 and 7.3% increases) due to the elevated evaporative demand of the atmosphere, respectively, E a from bare soils is projected to reduce by 50&nbsp;mm (equivalent to a 16.5% decrease) in response to a decrease in rainfall by 46% in the Mediterranean region of Turkey by the 2070s predicted by RCM, and consequently, to decreased soil wetness in the future. },

Plasmid pB48.215 DNA contained a synthetic Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) crylAc coding sequence flanked by the double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and nopaline synthase (Nos) terminator sequences, and the selectable marker gene, neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptil) controlled by the promoter of the nopaline synthase gene was introduced into loblolly pine tissues by particle bombardment. The transformed tissues were proliferated and selected by kanamycin resistance conferred by the introduced NPTIi gene. Shoot regeneration was induced from the kanamycin-resistant callus, and transgenic plantlets were then produced. The presence of the introduced genes in the transgenic loblolly pine plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) analysis, by Southern blot analysis, and insect feeding assays.

The allele and genotype distributions of two SNPs (rs5962298 and rs9887672) showed significant differences between the control and NSMR groups (allele: p = 0.020 and 0.017; genotype: p = 0.025 for rs9887672 respectively). The distribution differences became more significant in girls, but disappeared in boys, suggesting a gender effect.

We compute the fractions of light that diffract past the UVCS external occulter and non-specularly pass into the spectrometer slit. The diffracted component of the stray light depends on the finite aperture of the primary mirror and on its figure. The amount of non-specular scattering depends mainly on the micro-roughness of the mirror. For reasonable choices of these quantities, the modeled stray-light fraction agrees well with measurements of stray light made both in the laboratory and during the UVCS mission.

  abstract={ A selection of commercially available poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers with different degrees of molecular alignment and crystallinity have been investigated utilizing a wide range of techniques including optical microscopy, infrared spectroscopy together with thermal and wide-angle X-ray diffraction techniques. Annealing experiments showed increased molecular alignment and crystallinity as shown by the increased values of birefringence and melting enthalpies. Crystallinity values determined from thermal analysis, density, unpolarized infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction are compared and discussed in terms of the inherent capabilities and limitations of each measurement technique. The birefringence and refractive index values obtained from optical microscopy are found to decrease with increasing wavelength of light used in the experiments. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the samples with relatively low orientation possess oriented non-crystalline array of chains whereas those with high molecular orientation possess well defined and oriented crystalline array of chains along the fiber axis direction. X-ray analysis showed increasing crystallite size trend with increasing molecular orientation. SEM images showed micro-cracks on low oriented fiber surfaces becoming smooth on highly oriented fiber surfaces. Excellent bending characteristics were observed with knotted fibers implying relatively easy fabric formation. },

The X-ray diffraction results indicate that the melt-crystallized sample of polyamide 618 transforms from the triclinic unit cell to the pseudo-hexagonal phase in the range of 120–180°C. In this range, the thermograph of polyamide 618 presents a broad endothermal peak. From the FTIR spectra, it was found that during the transition process of polyamide 618, the intensity of the intra-sheet hydrogen bonds becomes weak. At the same time, the CH2-amide bonds twist, and the all-trans conformation of methylene sequences is disordered by inserting the gauche conformation. The CH2 segments are in a mobile state because of the enhanced stretching and twisting vibrations of the C-CO and C-N bonds. },

In a large wetland (412 ha) behind a dam, Typha × glauca expanded 81,152 m2/year, and clone diameters extended 3.9 ± 0.61 m/year. In contrast, a mixed stand (mostly T. angustifolia) in an upstream wetland with fluctuating water levels expanded only 2,327 m2/year, and clones extended only 2.5 ± 0.75 m/year. While various factors could have caused these differences, a separate two-factor experiment in outdoor microcosms supported the hypothesis that stabilized water levels alone can enhance T. × glauca spread. The experiment indicated that both stabilized water levels and P additions increased P accumulation and growth of T. × glauca. Constant inundation (5–10 cm deep) allowed T. × glauca to produce 56% more biomass (61.6 ± 4.0 g) than a regime with two drawdowns (39.4 ± 1.9 g; p &lt; 0.001). Plants under constant inundation accumulated 0.15 ± 0.007 g P, which was 36% more than with one drawdown (0.12 ± 0.004 g; p &lt; 0.001) and 67% more than with two drawdowns (0.09 ± 0.005 g; p &lt; 0.001). Also as expected, the addition of 2 g P/m2 increased biomass 23% more than the control (57.8 ± 3.0 vs. 46.9 ± 3.0 g/plant; p = 0.02). Our microcosm results suggest that unavailable P can shift to a form that T. × glauca can use. Thus, internal eutrophication can augment rates of T. × glauca invasion. },

  abstract={ Structural studies of series of ‘as spun’ and drawn PEEK fibers have been carried out using X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy techniques. The analysis of results suggest that fibers produced at a constant draw ratio with increasing draw temperatures show enhanced orientation and crystalline behaviour. The resolved equatorial and meridional traces provide additional structural parameters in terms of crystallinity, crystallite size, and crystallite thickness. It is concluded that drawing at a temperature belowT g (i.e., 144 °C) results in poorly oriented non-crystalline materials, whereas drawing aboveT g results in highly oriented semicrystalline materials. Additional drawing proved to increase the overall orientation with slight improvements in lateral order of the chain molecules. Quantitative analysis revealed that the crystallite size increases with increasing drawing temperature. The results also revealed the increased crystallite size upon additional drawing. Crystalline orientation parameter, 〈P 2〉c, suggests almost perfect orientation. In all cases, the amorphous orientation is found to be lower than the overall orientation parameter obtained from the optical birefringence. As a result of additional drawing, crystalline orientation was found to increase slightly but the increase in the orientation of non-crystalline material was found to be substantial. An average crystalline density was determined from the orthorhombic unit cell dimensions. It was found to vary as a result of processing conditions. It was also found that the value of the maximum birefringence shows heavy dependence on the chain conformation. },

  abstract={ We report on the design, fabrication, and characterization of InP-based 1.55 μm wavelength large diameter (50 μm) electrically pumped vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers (EP-VECSELs). The hybrid device consists of a half vertical cavity surface emitting laser (1/2-VCSEL) structure assembled with a concave dielectric external mirror. The 1/2-VCSEL is monolithically grown on InP substrate and includes a semiconductor Bragg mirror and a tunnel junction for electrical injection. Buried (BTJ) and ion implanted (ITJ) tunnel junction electrical confinement schemes are compared in terms of their thermal and electrical characteristics. Lower thermal resistance values are measured for BJT, but reduced current crowding effects and uniform current injection are evidenced for ITJ. Using the ITJ technique, we demonstrate Room-Temperature (RT) continuous-wave (CW) single transverse mode laser operation from 50-μm diameter EP-VECSEL devices. We show that the experimental laser optical output versus injected current (L–I) curves are well-reproduced by a simple analytical thermal model, consistent with the thermal resistance measurements performed on the 1/2-VCSEL structure. Our results indicate that thermal heating is the main mechanism limiting the maximum CW output power of 50-μm diameter VECSELs, rather than current injection inhomogeneity. },

These landscapes have several core habitats and a different set of linear elements -habitat edges or ecotones, roads or railways, rivers, streams and hedgerows on farm land- whose plant composition were examined. Secondly, it aims to check plant diversity estimation in Mediterranean landscapes using parametric and non-parametric procedures, with two indices: Species richness and Shannon index. Land cover types and landscape linear elements were identified from aerial photographs. Their spatial information was processed using GIS techniques. Field plots were selected using a stratified sampling design according to relieve and tree density of each habitat type. A 50×20 m2 multi-scale sampling plot was designed for the core habitats and across the main landscape linear elements. Richness and diversity of plant species were estimated by comparing the observed field data to ICE (Incidence-based Coverage Estimator) and ACE (Abundance-based Coverage Estimator) non-parametric estimators. The species density, percentage of unique species, and alpha diversity per plot were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in linear elements than in core habitats. ICE estimate of number of species was 32% higher than of ACE estimate, which did not differ significantly from the observed values. Accumulated species richness in core habitats together with linear elements, were significantly higher than those recorded only in the core habitats in all the landscapes. Conversely, Shannon diversity index did not show significant differences. },

  abstract={ For the investigation of diversity-productivity relationships under natural conditions, we present an operationally feasible measurement scheme explicitly considering the spatial organization of vegetation. We hypothesised that the spatial arrangement of the coexistence of species influences patch-level productivity. To characterise diversity, co-occurrences of species were recorded along oval transects allowing scaling by aggregation between 5 cm and 25 m. Productivity was characterised by field radiometric measurements, calibrated for leaf area and biomass, arranged in a sampling scheme scalable between 20 cm and 50 m. All data were collected along a slight resource gradient in the Stipa-Bouteloua (upland) community of the northern mixed-grass prairie in Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan. We found a wide range of correlations (Kendall’s τ between −0.2 and 0.9) between various measures of diversity (species richness, local species combinations) and productivity (average and variability of leaf-area index) as a function of sampling unit size. For field assessment of patch-level composition and functioning, we recommend to use samples at the spatial resolution corresponding to the maximum number of local species combinations as an appropriate scale for comparison. We demonstrate how our sampling methodology can be considered for possible process-oriented inference about diversity and productivity. To characterise diversity-productivity relationships for long-term monitoring and prediction of plant community structure and functioning, scalable, repeatable, non-destructive observations should be applied. },

This paper presents a new approach to the puzzle-assembly problem that is based on using textural features and geometrical constraints. The texture of a band outside the border of pieces is predicted by inpainting and texture synthesis methods. Feature values are derived from these original and predicted images of pieces. An affinity measure of corresponding pieces is defined and alignment of the puzzle pieces is formulated as an optimization problem where the optimum assembly of the pieces is achieved by maximizing the total affinity measure. A Fast Fourier Transform based image registration technique is used to speed up the alignment of the pieces. Experimental results are presented on real and artificial data sets. },

The structural rearrangements involve almost all chromosomes of the karyotype. Several paired chromosomal rearrangements have been revealed and include del(9)(p21), as well as two derivates of chromosome 3 with a breakpoint at the p25 locus, i.e., der(3)t(3;12)(3p25;12q11∼12;12q21∼24.?1) and der(3)t(3;?)(3p25).

Two basic methodologies particle bombardment andAgrobacterium-mediated transformation have been used on conifers. However, routine procedures exist for only a limited number of conifers. As a result only a few species have been successfully transformed into stable transgenic plants. The use of a particle bombardment has been more successful and transgenic plants have been produced inPicea abies, Picea glauca, Picea mariana, andPinus radiata, although the level of production of stable transgenic plants is lower than that ofAgrobacterium. At present, breeding programs have been directed toward improving bole shape, growth rate, wood properties, and quality, as well as toward improving root and shoot performance, pest resistance, stress tolerance, herbicide resistance, and ability to resist stresses, which will drive forestry to enter a new era of productivity and quality.

Urban expansion is threatening the desert habitat and unique vegetation communities surrounding Arequipa, one of Peru's largest cities. A 511 ha tract contiguous to the city of Arequipa has been informally designated an ecological park. Analysis of Landsat satellite imagery over a 16-year interval indicates that urban expansion is occurring in the direction of the park. The land use/land cover change analysis revealed other landscape patterns and processes, such as agricultural expansion, which are relevant to the study area. These dynamics, plus principles of landscape ecology, suggest that the park's size and shape may not be the most suitable. Conservation alternatives include the expansion of the park, the spatial connection to another nature reserve, or the design of co-management strategies. Given local historical events and the paucity of regional conservation efforts, social actors in Arequipa and in national governmental institutions will need to find practical ways to collaborate. },

With increasing aging time, there was an increase in wettability, oxygen containing polar functional groups (i.e., C-O, C=O and O-C=O) due to oxidation, the amount of talc, and bearing depth and roughness on the PP surface, while there was a decrease in the number of hydrocarbon groups (i.e., C-C and C-H). AFM indicated that the Ar-plasmatreatment on a PP blend surface transforms the wholly annular surface into a locally dimpled surface, leading to an improvement in wettability. SEM showed that the PP layer observed in the non-plasma-treated sample was removed after the Ar-plasma treatment and the rubber particles were exposed to the surface. The observed surface characterization and morphologies are responsible for the improved wettability and interfacial adhesion between the PP blend substrate and bumper coating layers. },

  abstract={ Salinity stress is one of the most serious factors limiting the distribution and productivity of crops and forest trees. The detrimental effects of salt on plants are a consequence of both a water deficit resulting in osmotic stress and the effects of excess sodium ions on critical biochemical process. A novel approach to improve salt tolerance has been established by using the technology of plant genetic transformation and using loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) as model plant. Mature zygotic embryos of loblolly pine were infected withAgrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404 harbouring the plasmid pBIGM which carrying the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mt1D) and glucitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GutD). Organogenic transgenic calli and transgenic regenerated plantltes were produced on selection medium containing 15mg/L kanamycin and confimed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. Salt tolerance assays demonstrated that the salt tolerance of transgenic calli and regenerated plantlets were increased. These results suggested that an efficientAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation protocol for stable integration of foreign genes into loblolloy pine has been developed and this could be useful for the future studies on engineering breeding of conifers. },

It is believed that there were a series of landscape ecological problems caused by city expansion: landscape ecological connectivity was low; landscape structure was simplified; the fragmentation of green land patch was more obvious on the plain areas, moreover, spatial distribution of green land was unbalanced. For this reason, this study adopted accumulative cost distance model, combined with ecosystem services and spatial interactions of landscape types, analyzed the spatial difference of the ecological function and the compactness of landscape structure in the study area, and further discussed the landscape pattern optimization proposal. We find that it is essential to protect and establish ecological sources, to establish urban ecological corridors, and to establish ecological nodes at the landscape ecological strategic positions so as to intensify spatial relationships among landscape elements and maintain continuity of landscape ecological process and pattern in the course of city expansion. The methods and final results from this study are expected to be useful for landscape ecological planning in Beijing region. },

This is the first report of Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA integration in P. pinaster confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The omission of casein hydrolysate from culture medium during cocultivation and subsequent subculture was crucial to control Agrobacterium growth. Two different transformation protocols were compared: (1) bacterial drops were spread over embryogenic clumps; (2) a mixture of bacterial and embryogenic cell suspensions was plated on filter paper. The highest frequency of transformation (22 independent transformed lines per g fresh weight, for embryogenic clone 31/668/00) was obtained with Protocol 2. The same basic procedure allowed transformation of embryogenic cell suspensions, which was dependent on subculture age. From 52 hygromycin-resistant independent lines obtained, 47 showed stable uidA gene expression and were PCR-positive for uidA gene and 42 for hpt gene. No residual Agrobacterium was detected in the transformed lines. Transgene integration was achieved using both protocols, as confirmed by Southern hybridization. From 38 (90%) transformed lines successfully cryopreserved and recovered, 71% regrown replicates have maintained the frequency of cell aggregates and early-formed embryos with uidA expression. Maturation of 44 transformed lines gave rise to 3 mature somatic embryos, each one coming from a different transformed line. Our results show the high potential of Protocol 2 for application to different culture systems. },

  abstract={ Diese Literaturübersicht zeigt den heutigen Kenntnisstand über nachteilige Effekte des Rauchens auf die Heilung von Knochen und Weichtteile, hauptsächlich am Beispiel der drittgradig offenen Unterschenkelfraktur dargestellt. Die pathophysiologischen Effekte des Rauchens sind u. a. Vasokonstriktion der Arteriolen, Hypoxie auf Zellniveau, Knochendemineralisation und verzögerte Revaskularisation. Sowohl in klinischen als auch in experimentellen Studien wird deutlich, dass bei Rauchern die klinische Frakturheilung länger dauert als bei Nichtrauchern und dass die Inzidenz der Pseudarthrosen höher liegt. Insbesondere in der plastischen und mikrovaskulären Chirurgie sind die negativen Effekte des Rauchens, z. B. die höhere Rate an Gewebenekrose und Hämatomen, schon lange bekannt. Vor allem Rauchern mit offenen Unterschenkelfrakturen drohen alle nachteiligen Effekte ihrer Sucht, da gerade diese Frakturen mit einem gravierenden Weichteilschaden, also auch längerer Heilungsperiode und einer höheren Anzahl von Pseudarthrosen, einhergehen. Werden mikrochirurgische Techniken eingesetzt, führt das Weiterrauchen zu einer erheblich höheren Rate von Wundinfekten, muskulären Verschiebelappennekrosen und Spalthautverlusten. Das sofortige Einstellen des Rauchens dagegen hat sowohl kurz- als auch langfristig günstige Einflüsse.

  abstract={ Embryos of 24 open-pollinated families of loblolly pine (Pinus teade L.) were used as explants to conduct in vitro regeneration. Then, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the plasmid pPCV6NFHygGUSINT was used to transform mature zygotic embryos of seven families of loblolly pine. The frequency of transformation varied among families infected with A. tumefaciens. The highest frequency (100%) of transient β-glucuronidase (GUS)-expressing embryos was obtained from family 11-1029 with over 300 blue spots per embryo. Expression of the GUS reporter gene was observed in cotyledons, hypocotyls, and radicles of co-cultivated mature zygotic embryos, as well as in callus and shoots derived from co-cultivated mature zygotic embryos. Ninety transgenic plants were regenerated from hygromycin-resistant callus derived from families WO3, 8-1082 and 11-1029, and 19 transgenic plantlets were established in soil. The presence of the GUS gene in the plant genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot, and plant DNA/T-DNA junction analysis. These results suggest that an efficient A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation protocol for stable integration of foreign genes into loblolly pine has been developed and that this transformation system could be useful for future studies on transferring economically important genes to loblolly pine. },

  abstract={ This paper explores the role of geographic prioritization as a means of identifying lands that are especially well suited to restoration in the historical floodplain of western Oregon's Willamette River. The river and its floodplain have been extensively modified since 1850. As a result, the quantity and quality of river habitat have declined. The approach illustrated here explicitly links the potential for ecological benefits from restoration with the social and economic likelihood of restoration success. Using a consistent analytical framework, longitudinal patterns in selected biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics are quantified along the entire river length, from Eugene to Portland. Areas with high potential for ecological recovery and low socioeconomic constraints have the greatest potential for future restoration. Areas that combine low potential for ecological response with high demographic and economic costs are likely to be poor choices for restoration. Areas with high ecological potential and intermediate levels of socioeconomic constraints present intermediate opportunities for restoration. The paper identifies high priority locations for restoration, assuming the purposes of restoration are to increase river channel complexity, increase floodplain forest area, and increase natural water storage during floods. It concludes by discussing the role of visualizations in citizen involvement. },

  abstract={ A biolistic transformation procedure was applied to co-transform embryogenic tissue of Pinus radiata and Picea abies with two plasmid DNAs. The first vector contained the bar gene, specifying resistance to the herbicide glufosinate, under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. This plasmid also contained the Pinus radiata germin cDNA sequence, in either sense or antisense orientation, driven by the ubiquitin promoter. The second vector contained both the nptII gene under control of the CaMV&nbsp;35S promoter for selection of transgenic tissue on geneticin and the uidA reporter gene under control of the double CaMV&nbsp;35 promoter. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of selected geneticin-resistant tissue showed that the transformation rates for the co-bombarded plasmid were high in both Pinus radiata (75%) and Picea abies (86%). A combination of phenotypic analysis and Northern hybridisation demonstrated that a number of the transgenic lines expressed all four transgenes. Regenerated plantlets from Pinus radiata and Picea abies transgenic lines were spray-tested with commercial rates of Buster (glufosinate at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0&nbsp;kg active ingredient per hectare). Transgenic plants survived and continued to grow with minor or no damage to their needles, whereas non-transgenic plants regenerated from the same cell lines died within 8&nbsp;weeks of spraying. To our knowledge, this is the first report on genetically engineered herbicide resistance in conifers, and the results demonstrate that this trait is a feasible option for plantation forestry. },

  abstract={ Additional virulence (vir) genes in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and sonication were investigated for their impact on transformation efficiency in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Mature zygotic embryos of loblolly pine were co-cultivated with disarmed A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 containing either plasmid vector pCAMBIA1301 or vector pCAMBIA1301 with an additional 15.8-kb fragment carrying extra copies of the Vir&nbsp;B, Vir&nbsp;C, and Vir&nbsp;G regions from the supervirulent plasmid pTOK47. pCAMBIA1301 contains hygromycin resistance and the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Expression of GUS was observed after 3–6&nbsp;days of co-cultivation, with peak expression at approximately 21&nbsp;days. The highest numbers of GUS-expressing areas were visible up to 21&nbsp;days after co-cultivation, declining rapidly thereafter. Both transient and stable transformation efficiencies increased when the explants were sonicated before co-cultivation and/or the additional virB, virC, and virG genes were included with the pCAMBIA1301 plasmid T-DNA. Use of the plasmid with additional vir genes and sonication dramatically enhanced the efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer not only in transient expression but also in the recovery of hygromycin-resistant lines. Stably transformed cultures and transgenic plants were produced from embryos transformed with A. tumefaciens EHA105 carrying pCAMBIA1301 or pCAMBIA1301+pTOK47 in the three families of loblolly pine. The presence of the introduced GUS and hygromycin phosphotransferase genes in the transgenic plants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization analyses. },

  abstract={ Optical imaging is a powerful technique with which to investigate the activity, distribution and movement of biomolecules. The increased resolution of images obtained with confocal microscopy now allows us to visualize the signalling events in individual intracellular organelles. Local photobleaching and uncaging of caged compounds enable investigators to control the activity of many biologically important molecules in small localized regions of both cytosol and internal spaces of cellular organelles. Uncaging and photobleaching conveniently complement laser scanning confocal microscopy. The whole-cell recording configuration of the patch-clamp technique has been widely used not only to measure ionic currents, but also to control the concentration of important molecules in the cytosol. The cell-attached configuration of patch clamp was utilized for local stimulation of the cell and local delivery of the second messengers. This paper describes the advantages of combining patch-clamp and optical imaging methods as well as some of the recent achievements using this approach. },

Sequence analysis revealed a number of putative cis elements, including AC-rich motifs common in promoters of genes related to the phenylpropanoid pathway. The isolated promoter was fused to the GUS reporter gene and its expression profile analyzed in transgenic tobacco and in transient transformation experiments with P. radiata embryogenic and xylogenic tissue. The promoter conferred weak expression in embryogenic tissue but caused strong GUS activity in both ray parenchyma cells and developing tracheary elements of xylem strips. Histochemical analysis in transgenic tobacco plants revealed that the AEOMT promoter induced GUS expression in cell types associated with lignification, such as developing vessels, phloem and wood fibers and xylem parenchyma as well as in non-lignifying phloem parenchyma. The isolated promoter was activated by challenge of the tissue with a fungal pathogen. Our results also indicate that the control of lignin-related gene expression is conserved and can be compared in evolutionarily distant species such as tobacco and pine. },

The calorimetric results, compared with WAXD data, were applied to determine the theoretical melting temperature and crystallization enthalpy. The DSC and WAXD data were combined in order to calculate the total amount of the crystallizable fraction of the polymer, and a model was proposed to explain the difference between the fractions of crystallinity observed with these techniques. The thermal and X-ray data were also correlated with different lamellar morphologies arising from the crystallization conditions. Finally, DSC experiments on the crystallized sample were used to detect the presence of a rigid amorphous phase which does not relax at T g. },

Our research demonstrated that these two fibers exhibited excellent mechanical properties and outstanding thermal and thermo-oxidative stability. Their long-term mechanical tensile performance at high temperatures was found to be critically associated with the stability of the C—O or C—S linkage at the heterocyclic rings on these polymers' backbones. PBZO fibers with the C—O linkages displayed substantially higher thermal stability compared to PBZT containing C—S linkages. High resolution pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry provided the information of the pyrolyzates' compositions and distributions as well as their relationships with the structures of PBZT and PBZO. Based on the analysis of the compositions and distributions of all pyrolyzates at different temperatures, it was found that the thermal degradation mechanisms for both of these heterocyclic polymers were identical. Kevlar®-49 fibers were also studied under the same experimental conditions in order to make a comparison of thermo-oxidative stability and long-term mechanical performance at high temperatures with PBZO and PBZT fibers. The data of two high-performance aromatic polyimide fibers were also included as references. },

  abstract={ Ngauruhoe cone, in southern Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, has grown rapidly over the last 2,500&nbsp;years in an alternation of effusive, strombolian, vulcanian, and sub-plinian eruptions of andesitic magma. At times growth has been 'staccato' in fashion as evidenced in the historical record. Each historical eruption typically lasted days to months, alternating with repose periods of years to decades. Major historic eruptions occurred in 1870 1949 1954–1955 and 1973–1975, encompassing wide variations in eruptive style over short timescales. The early period of cone building appears to have been dominated by a more continuous form of activity characterised by a series of numerous frequent explosive eruptions, with associated lava flows. The 2.2-km3 cone has grown in a piecemeal sectorial manner reflecting constant modification to the morphology of the summit, which has funnelled eruption products to specific sectors of the cone. Eruption rates can be calculated on several different timescales. Discharge rates averaged over individual eruptive pulses vary by two orders of magnitude (2.7–280&nbsp;m3&nbsp;s–1), reflecting variations in high level magma ascent rates and processes such as degassing, which are, in turn, reflected in contrasting eruptive styles. Lower rates (e.g. 0.65&nbsp;m3&nbsp;s–1) are obtained by averaging the discharge over an entire eruption lasting several months and may correspond to the ascent rate of magma batch(es) feeding the eruption. The long-term growth rate of Ngauruhoe is 0.9&nbsp;km3&nbsp;ky–1. This is an average rate reflecting the long-term deep supply rate of magma to crustal reservoirs. By looking at eruption rates on these different timescales we are better able to constrain processes occurring at various depths within the plumbing system. There are few detailed studies of the growth patterns of young volcanic cones, but such data are essential in understanding the dynamics of andesitic systems. More than 60 lavas and pyroclastic units mapped on different sectors of Ngauruhoe cone have been correlated by flow chronology and their distinctive compositions into five groups. Although the cone has grown rapidly, Ngauruhoe shows little evidence for the existence of large crustal magma reservoirs and long-lived magma batches. Instead, abrupt and non-systematic changes in magma chemistry and isotopic composition between and within the five groups indicate that the volcano has an open-system, multi-process, multi-directional character and erupts small (&lt;0.1&nbsp;km3) and short-lived (100–103&nbsp;years) magma batches with no simple time–composition relationships between successive batches. },

  abstract={ There is indirect evidence that the plasmalemma-integrated eukaryotic porin (the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel, VDAC) functions as the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC). The channel, which is believed to play a role in cell volume regulation, appears to be relevant for cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy, in that it may function as an alternative Cl– channel. In the present study we showed first that Gd3+ altered the voltage dependence of human type-1 porin incorporated into artificial planar lipid bilayers. Next, using a light-scattering approach on transformed normal or CF human B-lymphocytes in hypotonic Ringer solution, we found slightly differing regulatory volume decrease (RVD) curves for the cell lines under study. Addition of 15–60&nbsp;µM GdCl3 in hypotonic Ringer increased light scattering, pointing to cell swelling beyond normal values. RVD was not observed in those experiments. A corresponding effect was seen in isotonic Ringer containing GdCl3. In either osmotic situation Gd3+-induced cell swelling was abolished by monoclonal mouse anti-human type-1 porin antibodies. Agonist and antibody effects were dose dependent. Finally, videocamera-monitored control experiments with adherent HeLa cells verified the direct effect of the agonist on cell swelling in hypo- or isotonic situations and its prevention by the antibodies. We conclude that GdCl3 opens plasmalemma-integrated porin channels, allowing ions to following their gradients, resulting in cell swelling. Since respiratory epithelium expresses porin channels in the apical membrane, the use of gadolinium to activate ORCC may represent a new therapeutic approach in CF. },

In assessing the initial evidence in the Italian case, we argue that too much weight has been given to the latter objective, and that further reductions in average taxation on profits may be needed. },

  abstract={ Event trees are useful frameworks for discussing probabilities of possible outcomes of volcanic unrest. Each branch of the tree leads from a necessary prior event to a more specific outcome, e.g., from an eruption to a pyroclastic flow. Where volcanic processes are poorly understood, probability estimates might be purely empirical – utilizing observations of past and current activity and an assumption that the future will mimic the past or follow a present trend. If processes are better understood, probabilities might be estimated from a theoretical model, either subjectively or by numerical simulations. Use of Bayes' theorem aids in the estimation of how fresh unrest raises (or lowers) the probabilities of eruptions. Use of event trees during volcanic crises can help volcanologists to critically review their analysis of hazard, and help officials and individuals to compare volcanic risks with more familiar risks. Trees also emphasize the inherently probabilistic nature of volcano forecasts, with multiple possible outcomes. },

The deposited films were studied by the complementary use of infrared absorption and photoluminescence emission. The vibrational bands and fluorescence emission of bulk anthracene were clearly identified in the films. This means that the organic molecules were not modified by photochemical reactions during the laser irradiations, despite the strong absorption of anthracene at 266&nbsp;nm. Among the growth parameters, the laser fluence was found to be critical in order to avoid the fragmentation of the anthracene molecules.

The El value of the PPTA single fiber was obtained as 156 GPa at room temperature from the initial slope of the stress–strain curve of the crystal lattice. However, the inclination of the stress–strain curve changed at a tensile stress of around 1000 MPa, which produced an El′ value of 199 GPa in a higher stress region. This indicates that the deformation mechanism in the crystal lattice at higher tensile stress was different from that in the initial stage of the tensile deformation.

  abstract={ Despite a recent review concluding that there is little or no reason to expect that the production of fish and other animals will increase with nutrient enrichment or eutrophication, there is a variety of evidence that anthropogenic nutrients can stimulate secondary production in marine ecosystems. Unique multiple-year fertilization experiments were carried out over fifty years ago in Scottish sea lochs that showed dramatic increases in the abundance of benthic infauna and greatly enhanced growth of fish as a result of inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions. These experiments appear to have provided a good qualitative model for the responses of the Baltic Sea to nutrient enrichment and resulting eutrophication. Historical comparisons by others have shown that the weight of benthic animals per unit area above the halocline in the Baltic is now up to 10 or 20 times greater than it was in the early 1920s and that the total fish biomass in the system may have increased 8 fold between the early part of the 1900s and the 1970s. While there are no similar data for the highly enriched central and southern North Sea, there is convincing evidence that the growth rates of plaice, sole, and other species have increased there since the 1960s or 1970s. Cross-system comparisons have also shown that there are strong correlations between primary production and the production and yield of fish and the standing crop and production of benthic macrofauma in phytoplankton-dominated marine ecosystems. Concerns over the growing nutrient (especially N) enrichment of coastal marine waters are clearly valid and deserve the attention of scientists and managers, but the recent demonizing of N ignores the fact that nutrients are a fundamental requirement for producing biomass. Decisions regarding the amount of N or P that will be allowed to enter marine ecosystems should be made with the full knowledge that there may be tradeoffs between increases in water clarity and dissolved oxygen and the abundance of oysters, clams, fish, and other animals we desire. },

  abstract={ Pulsed laser deposition of PTFE was carried out using a 1064-nm laser. Two different pulse regimes were examined to determine their effectiveness in causing deposition. The first of these consisted of a 20-ns Gaussian pulse, while the second was a pulse train comprising twenty 1-μs pulses with a total duration time of 100-μs. The main feature of the deposition technique that we present in this work is that ablation is induced by the efficient photothermal sensitization of graphite particles that are used to lightly dope (0.1&nbsp;wt. %) a PTFE target. Both of the pulse regimes produced thin films whose infrared spectra were similar to that of PTFE. For the ns-pulse, however, carbon particles were contained in the deposited films. This behavior can be easily interpreted within the framework of photothermal ablation. For the μs pulse train, homogeneous heating is achieved due to the long thermal diffusion length, which is comparable to the average distance between the graphite particles used to dope the PTFE target. The thin PTFE films are deposited mainly by the mechanism of monomer re-polymerization. The present study demonstrates that near-infrared lasers of the μs-pulse type, which are versatile, economical and widely used in industry, are capable of the deposition of PTFE. },

The laser beam has been split in two by a prism thus creating an artificial large-scale non-uniformity (≈90 μm). We recorded time resolved and static images of laser-gas jet interaction with and without an Al target. Multi 1D and 2D simulations show that such interaction acts redistributing the over-intensities over larger surface. This effect has to be attributed to ionization processes with consequent laser beam refraction. Results show that Argon gas jet produces a strong refraction of the laser beam thus strongly reducing the initial two spots separation. },

The purpose of this study was to use decision analysis to assess the value of routine imaging as part of the long-term follow-up of splenic injury in children managed nonoperatively. A literature review (1970–1999) on the management of blunt splenic trauma in children was performed. Data, including the use of follow-up imaging and the occurrence of delayed splenic rupture and death, on those patients managed nonoperatively were collected. The data were used to construct a decision tree. A Poisson distribution was used to determine the risk of delayed splenic rupture. Information was extracted from 26 cohort studies. Nineteen of these studies were retrospective and six were prospective. One study had both retrospective and prospective arms. The study population consisted of 1,083 children. Of these patients, 920 (85 %) underwent routine follow-up imaging (US, CT, or scintigraphy). Follow-up imaging was either not performed or selectively performed in 163 patients (15 %). No cases of post-discharge splenic rupture or death were encountered in any of these groups. The maximum risk of delayed splenic rupture in the entire group was 0.3 % (0–3.7 cases). . The risk of delayed splenic rupture following blunt injury in children is very low, and is apparently unaffected by imaging protocols. No deaths, even in cases of delayed presentation, were identified in our study. These findings do not support the use of routine follow-up imaging of children with blunt splenic trauma. },

Pure SPS, which was crystallized at Tc=220 and 240°C had single melting endotherm and multiple endotherms, respectively, whereas the 70/30 SPS/PPO blends showed the opposite behavior with respect to Tc. Investigation by polarizing optical microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering revealed that the rejected impurity (PPO in blend and noncrystallizable chains with low molecular weight in pure SPS) during SPS crystallization resides between primary lamellae of SPS and thus the recrystallization strongly suppressed for the pure SPS crystallized at Tc=220°C and the 70/30 SPS/PPO blend crystallized at Tc=240°C. This may induce single melting endotherm. In the pure SPS crystallized at Tc=240°C and the 70/30 SPS/PPO blend crystallized at Tc=220°C, the rejected impurity resided between SPS crystalline fibrils, which consist of lamellae. This may allow recrystallization between the primary lamellae which would exhibit sharp multiple melting endotherms. },

The coarse ecoregion divisions accurately capture intuitively-understood regional environmental differences, whereas the finer divisions highlight local condition gradients, ecotones, and clines. Such statistically generated ecoregions can be produced based on user-selected continuous variables, allowing customized regions to be delineated for any specific problem. By creating an objective ecoregion classification, the ecoregion concept is removed from the limitations of human subjectivity, making possible a new array of ecologically useful derivative products. A red–green–blue visualization based on principal components analysis of ecoregion centroids indicates with color the relative combination of environmental conditions found within each ecoregion. Multiple geographic areas can be classified into a single common set of quantitative ecoregions to provide a basis for comparison, or maps of a single area through time can be classified to portray climatic or environmental changes geographically in terms of current conditions. Quantified representativeness can characterize borders between ecoregions as gradual, sharp, or of changing character along their length. Similarity of any ecoregion to all other ecoregions can be quantified and displayed as a “representativeness” map. The representativeness of an existing spatial array of sample locations or study sites can be mapped relative to a set of quantitative ecoregions, suggesting locations for additional samples or sites. In addition, the shape of Hutchinsonian niches in environment space can be defined if a multivariate range map of species occurrence is available. },

Parameters that included medium volume, cell growth time, gyration speed, pH, substrate concentration, and dissolved oxygen concentration were evaluated for a scale-up production of DOD in batch cultures using Fernbach flasks and a bench-top bioreactor. Maximum production of about 2 g DOD (38% yield) was attained in Fernbach flasks containing 500 ml medium when cells were grown at 28°C and 300 rpm for 16–20 h and the culture was adjusted to pH 7 prior to substrate addition. Increases of medium volume and substrate concentration failed to enhance yield. When batch cultures were initially conducted in a reactor, excessive foaming occurred that made the bioconversion process inoperable. This was overcome by a new aeration mechanism that provided adequate dissolved oxygen to the fermentation culture. Under the optimal conditions of 650 rpm, 28°C, and 40–60% dissolved oxygen concentration, DOD production reached about 40 g (40% yield) in 4.5 L culture medium using a 7-L reactor vessel. This is the first report on a successful scale-up production of DOD. },

  abstract={ Liposomes prepared from a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) phospholipid fraction have been shown to have significantly different physical and chemical characteristics and appeared to be more stable in a variety of conditions than liposomes prepared from soya phospholipid material. These liposome systems were used to try to encapsulate model hydrophobic (β-carotene) and hydrophilic (potassium chromate) compounds. Liposomes produced from the MFGM-derived phospholipids showed significantly higher entrapment efficiencies for both β-carotene and potassium chromate. The differences were particularly apparent when using the hydrophobic molecules at low ratios of β-carotene to phospholipid. It is likely that the improved incorporation efficiency for β-carotene is due to the partitioning of the molecule between the aqueous phase and the phospholipid membrane, a property which will be dependent on the specific composition of the phospholipid material used. The higher encapsulation efficiency for the potassium chromate appeared to reflect the slightly larger diameter of the liposomes produced from the MFGM material. These results suggest that there may be inherent advantages in the use of liposomes prepared from MFGM-derived phospholipids via microfluidization for the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. },

The generation of two consecutive high-current REB pulses with a duration of 60 ns was achieved at the Tonus accelerator with modified schemes of high-voltage pulse formation. The first version of the formation scheme enabled pulse powers of 2 and 4.0–9.6 GW with a time interval between the pulses of 500 ns. The second version enabled one to generate pulses with powers of 1.8 and 16 GW and time interval between the pulses of 160 µs. The transportation parameters of an REB injected into a 1.4-m-long PR filled with an N2: O2 gas mixture are studied. The conductance of the plasma produced under the action of the electron beams is measured. It is shown that the schemes proposed provide more efficient (by 35–45%) transportation of the REBs in the reactor volume as compared to single-pulse high-current REBs of the same power and pulse duration. },

We have separated and purified 12,13,16-THOA from its isomer, 12,13,17-THOA, by silica gel column chromatography and by preparative TLC. Its structure was then confirmed by proton and 13C NMR analyses. Purified 12,13,16-THOA was used as a substrate to study the biosynthesis of THFA. Within 24 h of incubation, cells of strain ALA2 converted 12,13,16-THOA to both 12-hydroxy-13,16-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (12-hydroxy-THFA) and 7,12-dihydroxy-13,16-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (7,12-dihydroxy-THFA). The relative abundance of 7,12-dihydroxy-THFA increased with incubation time, whereas that of 12,13,16-THOA and of 12-hydroxy-THFA decreased. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway of THFA from linoleic acid by strain ALA2 is as follows: linoleic acid→12,13-dihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid→12,13,16-THOA→12-hydroxy-THEA→7,12-dihydroxy-THFA. },

It is concluded that zero-field splitting and optical spectra as well as g&nbsp;factors are in good agreement with the experimental data and the distorted local lattice structure is determined firstly results from a stretching of the O2- ions along the C3&nbsp;axis. The pressure-induced shifts of energy levels, g&nbsp;factors and local lattice structure are also discussed. In particular, all the calculations are carried out successfully within the framework of the crystal-field model which is consistent with the opinion of Macfarlane and Sturge that if all terms within the d3 configuration are included, one need not go outside conventional crystal-field theory. },

ALA2 was investigated. When cultivated with linoleic acid as a substrate, the strain produced 12,13,17-trihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (THOA), DEOA, and hDEOA as well as other FA. To clarify the synthetic route to these bicyclic FA, the strain was cultivated with purified THOA as a starting substrate. THOA was consumed almost completely by the strain with sequential generation of DEOA and hDEOA. Moreover, the strain produced hDEOA when cultivated with purified DEOA. Therefore, it was confirmed that THOA was a precursor of these bicyclic FA and that hDEOA was generated from DEOA. Based on our previously reported result that linoleic acid is first converted to 12,13-dihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (DHOA) and the present results, the overall biosynthetic pathway for the diepoxy bicyclic FA from linoleic acid was postulated as: linoleic acid→DHOA→THOA→DEOA→hDEOA. },

  abstract={ It is difficult to watch wild animals while they move, so often biologists analyse characteristics of animal movement paths. One common path characteristic used is tortuousity, measured using the fractal dimension (D). The typical method for estimating fractal D, the divider method, is biased and imprecise. The bias occurs because the path length is truncated. I present a method for minimising the truncation error. The imprecision occurs because sometimes the divider steps land inside the bends of curves, and sometimes they miss the curves. I present three methods for minimising this variation and test the methods with simulated correlated random walks. The traditional divider method significantly overestimates fractal D when paths are short and the range of spatial scales is narrow. The best method to overcome these problems consists of walking the dividers forwards and backwards along the path, and then estimating the path length remaining at the end of the last divider step. },

To avoid numerical oscillations caused by the dispersion term in the KdV equation, two numerical techniques were introduced to improve the numerical stability. The Legendre, Chebyshev and Hermite polynomials were used as the basis functions. The proposed numerical scheme is validated by applications to the Burgers equation (nonlinear convection-diffusion problem) and KdV equation (single solitary and 2-solitary wave problems), where analytical solutions are available for comparison. Numerical results agree very well with the corresponding analytical solutions in all cases. },

The bioconversion was scaled up in a 7-l bench-top, stirred-batch reactor to produce DOD for testing of potential industrial uses. Aeration was supplied continuously from the top through two ports on the headplate and periodically through a bottom sparger, in conjunction with the use of marine impellers for agitation. This unique aeration arrangement maintained the dissolved O2 concentration in the 40–60% range during the period of maximal bioconversion and it also avoided excessive medium foaming during the reaction. Furthermore, the level of dissolved O2 in the first 24&nbsp;h of reaction played an important role in the initial rate of DOD production. DOD production reached a plateau after 72&nbsp;h with a yield up to 100&nbsp;g (or 50% recovery) from a total of 9&nbsp;l medium from two reactors run simultaneously. The final culture broth was processed using newly adapted procedures in the pilot plant that included crystallization of DOD from ethyl acetate solution at −15 °C. The newly developed bioprocess will serve as a platform for the scale-up production of other value-added products derived from vegetable oils and their component fatty acids. },

This article describes why it is prudent to address these often secretly held apprehensions and how to help instructors feel free to employ their best pedagogical methods to teach evolution without lingering fear. Some suggestions are given for pre-college and college instructors interested in combining effective pedagogy with as little perceived threat as possible. Methods are offered that allow instructors to focus on underlying scientific misconceptions even if those misconceptions are ultimately facilitated by non-scientific sources, while giving creationist or creationist-leaning students a chance to learn the appropriate scientific conceptions without their religious beliefs being explicitly threatened in a science course. },

  abstract={ To compensate for her feelings of anger and helplessness over her mother’s abandonment and subsequent displacements, the foster child Gilly Hopkins seeks power and agency through the primary means at her disposal: through the use of language and fairy tales. She constructs a Cinderella fantasy of an idealized mother who will rescue her. She also resonates strongly with the Rumpelstiltskin story, as it is a story about the power of language, and highlights a dynamic of exploitation that seems familiar to her. Through relationships with William Ernest, Trotter, Mr. Randolph, and Miss Harris, Gillie learns, however, to move beyond the habit of exploiting others as objects, and to experience the beauty of language for its own sake. Her emotional and psychological development can be charted through her changing relationship to the imaginative and expressive potentialities of language. Most importantly, literacy becomes not a basis for illusory control and manipulative power, but for the kind of human relationships that make possible the building of a self. Language becomes a rich inner resource, not simply a means for power over others. },

  abstract={ Landscape ecology has made tremendous progress in recent decades, but as a rapidly developing discipline it is faced with new problems and challenges. To identify the key issues and research priorities in landscape ecology, a special session entitled “Top 10 List for Landscape Ecology in the 21st Century” was organized at the 16th Annual Symposium of the US Regional Association of International Association of Landscape Ecology, held at Arizona State University (Tempe, Arizona, USA) during April 25–29, 2001. A group of leading landscape ecologists were invited to present their views. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus, of the special session. We have organized the diverse and wide-ranging perspectives into six general key issues and 10 priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity, (2) integration between basic research and applications,(3) Conceptual and theoretical development, (4) education and training, (5)international scholarly communication and collaborations, and (6) outreach and communication with the public and decision makers. The top 10 research topics are: (1) ecological flows in landscape mosaics, (2) causes, processes, and consequences of land use and land cover change, (3) nonlinear dynamics and landscape complexity, (4) scaling, (5) methodological development, (6) relating landscape metrics to ecological processes, (7) integrating humans and their activities into landscape ecology, (8) optimization of landscape pattern, (9)landscape sustainability, and (10) data acquisition and accuracy assessment. We emphasize that, although this synthesis was based on the presentations at the“Top 10 List” session, it is not a document that has been agreed upon by each and every participant. Rather, we believe that it is reflective of the broad-scale vision of the collective as to where landscape ecology is now and where it may be going in future. },

Increased sensitivity and resolution for such molecules can only be observed in experiments that are optimized for transverse relaxation (TROSY). Substantial effects of magnetic alignment can easily be observed not only in paramagnetic proteins, but even in small molecules, such as chloroform. Such effects can be very useful for structural studies of biopolymers. The extreme resolution allows studies of very weak interactions in proteins. For instance, long-range H/D isotope effects are easily observed in H-N correlation experiments. The first systematic studies of relaxation properties of N-15 nuclei have been carried out for proteins at 500, 600, 800, and 900 MHz. },

Four sediments, types included , a beach sand, two fine-grained muds, but from different locations, and a 50:50 mixture of one of the mud sediments and beach sand. Our hypothesis was that the pattern of colonization would differ among sediment types based on empirical field data and theory but the differences would be expressed most strongly at sediment type extremes (e.g., mud versus sand). A total of 49 taxa colonized the four sediments. Unidentified Actiniaria (sea anemones) numerically dominated densities among all four sediments with densities ranging between 46.5 to 60.5 per microcosm (20 cm side−1). Average taxa richness per microcosm (N: 10 replicates per sediment treatment) ranged from 10.4 in one of the mud treatments to 14.9 taxa in the sand. These were the only significant differences among sediment types (P≤0.05) in taxa richness and we detected no significant effects of sediment type on animal densities. Differences in community metrics, although statistically significant, were generally of a relatively small magnitude. Five of 10 microcosms per treatment were randomly selected to test for effects of sediment depth (e.g., top, mid, and bottom). In vertically sectioned microcosms, average taxa richness in sand treatments was significantly greater than those of the other three sediments. A non-parametric multivariate analysis (Primer) revealed that community structure in the vertically sectioned microcosms differed significantly between sand and one of the mud treatments. Mean taxa richness of top sections differed significantly from mid and bottom sections. We detected significantly higher animal densities and taxa richness (p≤0.05) in vertically sectioned versus non-sectioned microcosms. However, these differences were unexplained based on experimental protocols. },

We first introduce a “variable” nondimensionalized version of the water-waves equations which vary from shallow to deep water, and which involves four dimensionless parameters. Using a nonlocal energy adapted to the equations, we can prove a well-posedness theorem, uniformly with respect to all the parameters. Its validity ranges therefore from shallow to deep-water, from small to large surface and bottom variations, and from fully to weakly transverse waves. The physical regimes corresponding to the aforementioned models can therefore be studied as particular cases; it turns out that the existence time and the energy bounds given by the theorem are always those needed to justify the asymptotic models. We can therefore derive and justify them in a systematic way. },

The mechanisms involved may include weak oestrogenic action and antioxidant activity. Our proteomic investigations of changes in the human serum profile in response to the consumption of isoflavones in soya functional foods suggest potentially beneficial modulation of the levels of a number of serum proteins, including increased apolipoprotein E (involved in lipid metabolism) and caeruloplasmin (antioxidant and copper regulatory properties) levels and decreased alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (involved in immunomodulation) levels that may contribute to vascular protection.

  abstract={ We linked a 2-dimensional water quality model of the Patuxent River with a spatially-explicit model of fish growth to simulate how changes in land use in the Patuxent River Basin would affect the growth rate potential (GRP) of Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). Simulations of three land-use patterns that reflected current nutrient loadings, increased nutrient loadings, and decreased nutrient loadings were used to drive the water quality model. Changes in nutrient loadings caused changes in the timing and intensity of phytoplankton concentrations and the region of hypoxia increased during summer with increased nutrient loading. The spatial distribution of menhaden GRP was highly correlated with phytoplankton concentrations and localized in the middle on third of the Patuxent River. Menhaden growth rate was highest in early June and late summer. During June, menhaden GRP (and phytoplankton concentration) was lowest at the lower nutrient loading simulation. During late summer, mean menhaden growth rates were inversely proportional to nutrient loading rates and menhaden grew best when nutrient loadings were the lowest. Upriver to mid-river phytoplankton patches drove overall mean calculations. Model results suggest that more research is needed on water quality model predictions of phytoplankton levels at a high level of spatial and temporal resolution, menhaden foraging, and menhaden habitat selection. },

  abstract={ Rhinanthus minor andRhinanthus angustifolius are known to hybridize in mixed populations in nature. These hybridization events can have important evolutionary consequences. The development and use of species-specific RAPD and ISSR markers allowed the detection of hybrid individuals not always distinguishable with morphological characters. Two mixed populations of different ages were studied. In a young mixed 2-year-old population, both individuals of the two parental species and F1 hybrids were found using genetic analysis, showing that hybridization occurred rapidly. Flower morphology of F1 hybrids was too variable to distinguish all these hybrids from the parental species. This morphological variability of F1 hybrids was also confirmed in artificial crosses in the greenhouse. In an old and no longer mixed 30-year-old population, onlyR. angustifolius plants and a few genetically introgressed individuals close toR. angustifolius were present. Genetic markers showed traces of past hybridization and introgression. Unidirectional introgression ofR. minor intoR. angustifolius with the complete disappearance ofR. minor from this population was observed. },

  abstract={ In Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) has been observed to be declining on elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) winter range for many decades. To support elk management decisions, the SAVANNA ecosystem model was adapted to explore interactions between elk herbivory and aspen dynamics. The simulated probability of successful vegetative regeneration for senescent aspen stands declines sharply when elk densities reach levels of 3–5 elk/km2, depending on model assumptions for the seasonal duration of elk foraging activities. For aspen stands with a substantial component of younger trees, the simulated regeneration probability declines more continuously with increasing elk density, dropping below 50% from densities at 8–14 elk/km2.At the landscape scale, simulated aspen regeneration probability under a scenario of extensive seasonal use was little affected by elk population level, when this level was above 300–600 elk (25%–50% current population) over the ca. 107 km2 winter range. This was because elk distribution was highly aggregated, so that a high density of elk occupied certain areas, even at low population levels overall. At approximately current elk population levels (1000–1200 elk), only 35%–45% of senescent aspen stands are simulated as having at least a 90% probability of regeneration, nearly all of them located on the periphery of the winter range. Successful management for aspen persistence on core winter range will likely require some combination of elk population reduction, management of elk distribution, and fencing to protect aspen suckers from elk browsing. },

  abstract={ Nowadays creativity is fashionable. Writers on management and organisation, for example, mention creativity as vital to entrepreneurship.1 They consider it to be as important as land, labour and capital, which form the traditional factors of production.2 And related terms such as ‘genius’ are in use again. An example of this is the widely read book Built to Last.3 Moreover, creativity and rationality are presented as alternatives. To be creative, managers are urged to put rationality aside: ‘being reasonable does not win the day’ they are assured4 and ‘all progress depends on the unreasonable man’.5 This view that rationality and creativity oppose each other is, however, unsatisfactory involving, as it does, a form of epistemological schizophrenia. One excludes the other only if we adopt a simplistic concept of rationality and an esoteric view of creativity. This article, therefore, sets out to clarify the relationship between the concepts of creativity and rationality. Three ideal-type concepts of rationality will be introduced (algorithmic, judgemental, reflective) and their tolerance of novelty discussed. Then two modes of creativity (explorative and transcendentive) are distinguished, followed by a discussion of whether rationality can enhance creativity. I conclude by reviewing some factors involved in creativity, such as tolerance for ambiguity, playfulness and attentiveness, and with a short discussion of the relationship of creativity to power.6 },

  abstract={ A bioenergetics model was developed and applied to questions of habitat use and migration behavior of nonindigenous European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA. The model was parameterized using existing data from published studies on the ecology and physiology ofC. maenas and allied brachyuran crabs., Simulations of the model were run describing four scenarios of habitat use and behavior during a 214-d simulation period (April–October) including crabs occupying mid littoral habitat, high littoral habitat, sublittoral habitat, and sublittoral habitat but undertaking intertidal migrations. Monthly trapping was done along an intertidal gradient in Willapa Bay to determine the actual distribution of crabs for the same time interval as the simulation period, and model results were compared to the observed pattern. Model estimates suggest no intrinsic energetic incentive for crabs to occupy littoral habitats since metabolic costs were c. 6% higher for these individuals than their sublittoral counterparts. Crabs in the littoral simulations were also less efficient than sublittoral crabs at converting consumed energy into growth. Monthly trapping revealed thatC. maenas are found predominantly in mid littoral habitats of Willapa Bay and there is no evidence of resident sublittoral populations. The discrepancy intimates the significance of other factors, including interspecific interactions, that are not incorporated into the model but nonetheless increase metabolic demand. Agonistic encounters with native Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister) may be chief among these additional costs, andC. maenas may largely avoid interactions by remaining in littoral habitats neglected by native crabs, such as meadows of nonindigenous smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). AdultC. maenas in Willapa Bay may occupy tidal elevations that minimize such encounters, and metabolic costs, while simultaneously maximizing submersion time and foraging opportunities. },

For transesterification levels higher than 23% the blends tend to transform into a one-phase system and the crystallization of PET is strongly inhibited due to the significant reduction of the PET segment length. For lower levels of transesterification the blends are phase separated and the overall crystallization behaviour can be explained considering the confined nature of the PET domains in these blends. The formation of a rigid amorphous phase in the intra-lamellar stack amorphous regions is reduced in the blends due to a lower probability of stack formation in the confined PET-rich domains. The more effective filling of the space by the lamellar crystals in the blends provokes a stronger restriction to the amorphous phase mobility of PET in the blends than in pure PET. },

  abstract={ Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis are two of the most common tree species of the western Mediterranean basin. Both species regenerate reliably after fire: P. halepensis colonizes recently disturbed areas by effective seedling recruitment, while Q. ilex resprouts vigorously after disturbances. For this reason, the natural regeneration of these species after fire should ensure the re-establishment of a forest similar to that which existed before the fire. This study analyzes with a simple simulation model whether or not the relative abundance of monospecific and mixed forests of these species in the landscape is altered by fire. We also analyze the topographic factors and the forest structure before the fire that determine the changes in forest composition after fire. This study has been carried out in a large fire that occurred in NE Spain. Overall, 33% of plots changed to another community type, but this probability of change varied considerably among community types before the fire. Monospecific forests of P. halepensis or Q. ilex had a high probability of remaining in their original composition after the fire, whereas the resilience of mixed forests of these two species was quite low. Mixed forests changed for the most part to monospecific P. halepensis or Q. ilex forests. Analysis of several factors determining these changes indicated that only elevation as a significant topographical variable. The effect of fire was to increase the altitudinal differentiation between the two species. P. halepensis forests that changed to mixed or Q. ilex forests were those of highest elevation, while the mixed and Q. ilex plots that changed to P. halepensis forests were those located at the lowest elevations. Concerning structural variables before fire, density of Q. ilex trees before the fire showed a much greater effect than P. halepensis density in determining the post-fire community. Finally, burn severity also influenced the changes observed. For both P. halepensis and Q. ilex forests, plots that changed to another forest type were mainly those that burned more severely. In the case of mixed forests, even low fire severities involved high probabilities of change to monospecific forests. },

A total of 206 Polytechnic students from Singapore completed a self-report questionnaire, which consisted of the Kirton Adaptation-Innovation Inventory (Kirton, 1976), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Saucier, 1994), Learning Goal Scale (Ng, 2003), What Kind of Person Are You Self-Report Inventory (Khatena &amp; Torrance, 1976), Gough’s Creative Adjective Checklist, Risk Scenario, and Risk Taking Attitude Scale developed by Ng. It was found that adaptors were significantly more conscientious and subscribe to risk avoidance, ego approach and ego avoidance orientations than innovators, whilst, innovators were significantly more extraverted and open to experience and are likely to subscribe to creativity, risk taking and mastery goal orientations than adaptors. No significant differences were found between adaptors and innovators in agreeableness. The implications for the findings for the classroom teacher will also be discussed. },

The microdomain structure in the melt and the final morphology after crystallization were also measured by conventional SAXS, and the melting behavior of crystallized samples was observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The binary blend forms a single microdomain structure in the melt over the whole composition range investigated, and the crystallization proceeds with an intermediate rate between those of the constituent PCL-b-PB copolymers to result in a single lamellar morphology. The time dependence of SR-SAXS curves is qualitatively similar in features to that for the crystallization of pure PCL-b-PB copolymers, suggesting that the crystallization of the blend is substantially controlled by a single crystallization mechanism. The remarkable change in the crystallization rate with composition is ascribed to the difference in the stability of preexisting microdomain structures. The conformation of (longer and shorter) PB blocks in the final lamellar morphology is qualitatively discussed. },

  abstract={ Large TSC gene rearrangements are not rare findings in tuberous sclerosis. Interestingly, all deletions, duplications and inversions so far described involve TSC2, none being associated with TSC1. In order to shed light on the structural basis of the preferential DNA rearrangements in TSC2 over TSC1 and to assess, in an unselected patient population, the prevalence of large rearrangements in both TSC loci, we screened 202 tuberous sclerosis patients consecutively referred at our center. Southern blot analysis on EcoRI+HindIII double-digested DNA identified 19 partial or full-length gene deletions: three involved TSC1 and sixteen TSC2. The breakpoint sequence of seven internal deletions, three in TSC1 and four in TSC2, allowed us to speculate on the mechanism favoring TSC2 unequal recombinations and to identify a deletion hot spot that lies in TSC1 and that may be relevant in the routine genetic testing of tuberous sclerosis. Briefly, three major features appear to distinguish TSC1 from TSC2 deletions: (1) deletion size: all TSC1 deletions are within the transcriptional unit, whereas 12 of the 16 TSC2 deletions have at least one external breakpoint; (2) location within the gene: all TSC1 deletions are confined to the 3'end of the gene (all three 5' breakpoints being located in intron&nbsp;20) thus resulting in the same frameshift mutation following amino acid K875, whereas the TSC2 internal breakpoints appear to be scattered along the gene; (3) preference for recombinatorial sequences: six out of eight internal TSC2 breakpoints map within Alu repeats, whereas none of the three TSC1 deletions appear to be Alu-mediated. Indeed, in the latter gene, unique structural features (a purine-rich tract flanked by pyrimidine-rich segments) surrounding one of the two identified breakpoint cluster regions might play a role in promoting inappropriate recombinations. },

Land uses were remnant prairie, lawns, corn fields of cash grain farms, and corn fields of dairies in Dane County, Wisconsin (USA). For each land use type, levels of analysis were sites (an agricultural field, residential lawn or prairie, ranging in size from 100 m2 to approximately 20 ha), 10-m plots within a site, and points within the 10-m diameter plot. The rank of mean soil P concentrations was cash grain &gt; dairy &gt; lawn &gt; prairie. For all land use types, most of the variance was accounted for by site-to-site variation. Among-site variance was higher for human-dominated sites (0.55, 0.15, 0.14 [log (mg/kg)]2 for cash grain, dairy, and lawn sites, respectively) than it was for prairies (0.07 [log (mg/kg)]2). However, prairies had the highest among-plot variation (0.04 [log (mg/kg)]2) compared to other sites (0.01, 0.002, and 0.01 [log (mg/kg)]2 for cash grain, dairy, and lawn sites, respectively). The results indicate that in this watershed, human activity has increased the mean soil P and variance of soil P, and shifted the scale of variance to larger spatial extents. Human impacts on landscape pattern extend to soil properties that affect nutrient flow and eutrophication of surface waters. Because soil P turns over slowly, the legacy of altered soil P patterns may affect freshwaters for centuries. },

  abstract={ Multiple indicators of sublethal stress (bioindicators) were used to assess the health and condition of two important estuarine fish species in the Pamlico Sound estuary following extensive flooding from three sequential hurricanes that occurred during early fall 1999. Bioindicators ranging from the biochemical to the reproductive and organism-level were used to assess the health of southern flounder and spot in Pamlico Sound compared to the health of these same species sampled from a relatively unaffected references site in lower Core Sound. Many of the physiological, reproductive, immunological, histopathological, and general condition indices suggested that both species, and particularly spot, in Pamlico Sound were sublethally stressed and in poorer condition than fish sampled from Core Sound. The major environmental stressors causing these sublethal stress responses in Pamlico Sound fish appears to be those related to episodic hypoxic exposure or a combination of effects associated with hypoxic conditions such as alterations in preferred habitat and food availability. Although fish populations in Pamlico Sound do not appear to be severely damaged or impaired at this time, organisms that are sublethally stressed can incur increased vulnerability to additional or future stressors such as modified physicochemical regimes, changes in food and habitat availability, and increases in infectious pathogens. Because of the low flushing rate (∼1 yr) of Pamlico Sound, recovery rate may be exceptionally slow, prolonging any adverse effects of altered nutrient regimes (such as hypoxia) on the health and fitness of resident fish populations. Flooding from the 1999 hurricanes may have contributed to the short-term health and condition of finfish species in Pamlico Sound and also influenced longer-term recovery and ecological status of this system. Longer-term manifestation of effects from flooding may be of particular concern as the frequency of hurricanes is expected to increase over the next few years and the accelerated uses of the coastal zone places further stress on estuarine resources. },

  abstract={ The frequency of spontaneous aneuploidy of the four autosomes and both sex chromosomes in the interphase nuclei of cultured and noncultured lymphocytes from clinically healthy men was examined by use of two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). It was shown that in noncultured cells from the individuals examined autosomal nullisomies were practically not detected (the frequency 0 to 0.01%). At the same time, the frequency of such cells with either Y, or X nullisomy was at least an order of magnitude higher (about 0.15%). This frequency was comparable with the level of Y- or X-disomic cells, and also with autosomal monosomies, precluding from consideration of X-nullisomic cells as hybridization artifact. During lymphocyte cultivation, a statistically significant increase in the total frequency of Y- or X-nullisomic cells was observed already after the first cell division cycle. Thus, interphase FISH analysis is a sufficiently sensitive method enabling detection of higher, compared to the autosomes, loss of sex chromosomes in the process of cell division, a phenomenon observed during replicative cell aging, as well as during natural aging of the organism. Male cells with the de novo lost single X chromosome, probably, switch to apoptosis and do not survive during further life of a cell population. The frequency of total aneuploidy in human somatic cells with the correction for the resolution capacity of the interphase FISH analysis was estimated to be 5.62 and 6.90% for noncultured and cultured cells, respectively. This aneuploidy level is close to that in spermatozoa. The data obtained can serve as the basis for the examination of the aneugenic (aneuploidy-inducing) genotoxic effects and for the analysis of interindividual genetic instability. },

  abstract={ Thalidomide and its derivatives represent a new class of antineoplastic drugs (IMiDs), which has been especially effective in certain hematologic malignancies. These agents have anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and immunomodulatory properties, and target tumor cells by direct cytotoxicity and indirectly by interfering with several components of the bone marrow microenvironment [1]. Thalidomide analogs that retain antitumor activity equal to or greater than the parent compound, but with less toxicity, have been developed [2]. This paper summarizes what is known about the mechanisms of action of these agents, and recent clinical results. The data suggest that thalidomide analogs will play a major role in the management of certain hematologic neoplasms in the near future. },

  abstract={ To determine whether fire spatial and temporal scales affect foraging behavior and grazing intensity by Bison (Bison bison), we burned three different patch sizes (225, 900, and 3600&nbsp;m2) across an otherwise homogeneous grassland landscape. We then monitored grazing intensity for the succeeding 14&nbsp;months. During the first 5&nbsp;months after the burn (August–January), the Bison grazing intensity pattern was affected by whether a plot was burned and only marginally affected by plot size. During the next 5&nbsp;months (January–June), grazing intensity was unaffected by plot size, but was greatest in the unburned 225 and 3600-m2 plots. The final 4&nbsp;months (June–October), grazing intensity was unaffected by treatments other than being higher in the unburned 3600-m2 plots. By the final sampling date, biomass was significantly greater in the burned plots and grazing intensity appeared to be responding to the amount of biomass present and the total amount of N present. The pattern displayed within the first 5&nbsp;months after the burn is congruent with the expectations of optimal foraging theory with overmatching in the smallest plot size of 225&nbsp;m2 (BioScience 37 (1987) 789–799). The next two sampling periods displayed a matching aggregate response relative to biomass availability (Oecologia 100 (1999) 107–117) and total nitrogen mass (g&nbsp;m−2). The temporal shift that we found in Bison response to burn patch size is, to our knowledge, the first such examination of both spatial and temporal responses by Bison to landscape heterogeneity. We now have quantitative evidence of how native herbivores can alter their foraging responses to changes in landscape structure over time. },

  abstract={ We sampled epiphytic and benthic macriinvertebrates in 20 beds of submersed vegetation throughout the Hudson River estuary to assess the importance of plant beds in providing habitat for macroinvertebrates and to determine which characteristics of plant beds affected the density and composition of macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrate densities in plant beds were 4–5 times higher, on average, than densities in unvegetated sediments in the Hudson. The macroinvertebrate community in plant beds was dominated by chironomid midges, oligochaete worms, hydroids, gastropods, and amphipods. Many species of macroinvertebrates were found chiefly on submersed plants, showing that plant beds are important in supporting biodiversity in the Hudson. Macroinvertebrates were most numerous in beds with high plant biomass and in the interiors of beds, whereas neither bed size nor position along the length of the estuary affected macroinvertebrate density. Community composition varied strongly with position along the river (freshwater versus brackish), habitat (epiphytic versus benthic), and position within the bed (edge versus interior). Plant biomass also influenced macroinvertebrate community composition, but bed area had relatively little influence. },

  abstract={ Roentgenographic studies are performed to investigate the structural changes in chitin under pressure and shear during its solid-state processing using a twin-screw extruder and Bridgman anvils. The structure of chitosan synthesized by the solid-phase method is studied. Deformation under the conditions of dry extrusion grinding at room temperature reduces the crystallinity of the original chitin. Addition of water restores the crystallinity of the material up to the value characteristic of the original chitin. Extrusion processing of chitin at room temperature with addition of water virtually preserves the crystallinity and degree of ordering of the chitin crystal lattice, the same as ordinary dry grinding at an elevated (180°C) temperature. The maximum degree of amorphization of chitin is attained by its processing on Bridgman anvils. Solid-state synthesis of chitosan from chitin leads to a product with a more amorphous structure in comparison with chitosan produced by the suspension method. },

  abstract={ Spatial variation in landforms and associated physical processes can often be described by allometric scaling relationships, similar to those describing organismal allometry. Because plant and animal distribution, abundance, and behavior are generally affected, if not sometimes controlled, by the physical environment, landform scaling likely causes parallel scaling of ecological patterns and process across the landscape, i.e., landscape allometry. Organismal allometry has a long history, well-established tradition, and well-developed body of theory. Landscape allometry is a newly emerging conceptual framework that offers explanation for ecological patterns and utility for practical issues such as allowing landscape-scale replication of experimental and control treatments, providing landscape-scale predictions of ecological pattern and process, providing design guidelines for landscape management, and providing diagnostic methods for assessing historical anthropogenic effects to landscapes. Organismal and landscape allometry could be used in complementary fashion, and perhaps ultimately integrated, to form a useful theoretical framework for ecology. },

  abstract={ Field experiments were carried out over a 2-year period on a loamy soil plot under corn in Montpellier (south-east France). The effectiveness of improved irrigation practices in reducing the adverse impact of irrigation on the environment was assessed. Different irrigation and fertiliser treatments were applied to identify the best irrigation and fertilisation strategy for each technique (furrow and sprinkler) to ensure both good yields and lower NO3 – leaching. No significant differences in corn yield and NO3 – leaching were found for the climatic scenario of 1999 between sprinkler and furrow irrigation during the irrigation season. Following the rainy events occurring after plant maturity (and the irrigation season), differences in N leaching were observed between the treatments. The study shows that both the fertiliser method, consisting of applying a fertiliser just before ridging the furrows, and the two-dimensional (2D) infiltration process, greatly influence the N distribution in the soil. N distribution seems to have a beneficial impact on both yield and N leaching under heavy irrigation rates during the cropping season. But, under rainy events (particularly those occurring after harvesting), the N, stored in the upper part of the ridge and not previously taken up by plants, can be released into the deeper soil layers in a furrow-irrigated plot. In contrast, the 1D infiltration process occurring during sprinkler irrigation events affects the entire soil surface in the same way. As a result the same irrigation rate would probably increase N leaching under sprinkler irrigation to a greater extent than under furrow-irrigation during an irrigation period. In order to assess the robustness of these interpretations derived from soil N-profile analysis, a modelling approach was used to test the irrigation and fertilisation strategies under heavy irrigation rates such as those occurring at the downstream part of closed-end furrows. The RAIEOPT and STICS models were used to simulate water application depths, crop yield and NO3 – leaching on three measurement sites located along the central furrow of each treatment. The use of a 2D water- and solute-transport model such as HYDRUS-2D enabled us to strengthen the conclusions derived from the observations made on the N distribution under a cross-section of furrow. This model helped to illustrate the risk of over-estimation of N leaching when using a simplified 1D solute-transport model such as STICS. },

  abstract={ This paper describes how to analytically characterize the connectivity of neuromorphic networks taking into account the morphology of their elements. By assuming that all neurons have the same shape and are regularly distributed along a two-dimensional orthogonal lattice with parameter Δ, we obtain the exact number of connections and cycles of any length by applying convolutions and the respective spectral density derived from the adjacency matrix. It is shown that neuronal shape plays an important role in defining the spatial distribution of synapses in neuronal networks. In addition, we observe that neuromorphic networks typically present an interesting property where the pattern of connections is progressively shifted along the spatial domain for increasing connection lengths. This arises from the fact that the axon reference point usually does not coincide with the cell center of mass of neurons. Morphological measurements for characterization of the spatial distribution of connections, including the adjacency matrix spectral density and the lacunarity of the connections, are suggested and illustrated. We also show that Hopfield networks with connectivity defined by different neuronal morphologies, which are quantified by the analytical approach proposed herein, lead to distinct performances for associative recall, as measured by the overlap index. The potential of our approach is illustrated for digital images of real neuronal cells. },

  abstract={ The sheer impact of the recent global financial turmoil and scandals (such as Enron and WorldCom) has demonstrated that unbridled commercial entrepreneurs who are allowed to pursue their short-term opportunities regardless of the consequences has led to a massive depreciation of the wealth of nations, social livelihood and environmental degradation. This article suggests that the time has come for entrepreneurs to adopt a more integrative view of business that blends economic, social and environmental values. Social entrepreneurs present such a proposition through their deep commitment towards the social vision, appreciation of sustainable practices, innovativeness, ability to build social networks and also generate viable financial returns. It could be expected that social entrepreneurs often possess certain distinct personality characteristics which define their behaviours/actions. Personality traits are partly developed by innate nurturing, socialization and education. These tacit traits are also formed values/beliefs held and play an important role in driving social entrepreneurial decision making. Thus, personality traits may influence the intentions and the manner in which the individual acts. We hold that if social entrepreneurship is to be effective and impactful, business and management education can facilitate the development of these critical personality traits. Thus, this study primes at determining the personality traits that influence social entrepreneurs’ start-up intentions. It also reinforces the findings that personality traits do influence entrepreneurship in general. This study examines the influence of the Big Five personality traits on social entrepreneurship dimensions. The findings reveal that agreeableness positively influences all dimensions of social entrepreneurship, whereas openness exerts a positive influence on social vision, innovation and financial returns. Methodologically, this study develops valid and reliable scales for social entrepreneurship and verifies the adopted Big Five personality measure of Schmit et al. (Pers Psychol 53:153–193, 2000) using the five-point Likert scale. The implication of this study is that element of appreciation of social responsibility, sustainability and character development needs to be integrated within the business education curriculum to support social entrepreneurs in realizing genuine value and impact to the causes and communities they serve. Future business leaders also need to be equipped with entrepreneurship skills, while exuding independent and reflective thinking in the pursuit life-long learning. The originality of this study lies in its focus on personality traits on social rather than commercial entrepreneurship. It is hoped that the findings will trigger a paradigm shift towards greater social entrepreneurship through education by nurturing sustainable development values in future business graduates. },

  abstract={ The response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming has important implications to potential feedbacks to climate. The interactions between topography, climate, and disturbance could alter recruitment patterns to reduce or offset current predicted positive feedbacks to warming at high latitudes. In northern Alaska the Brooks Range poses a complex environmental and ecological barrier to species migration. We use a spatially explicit model (ALFRESCO) to simulate the transient response of subarctic vegetation to climatic warming in the Kobuk/Noatak River Valley (200 × 400 km) in northwest Alaska. The model simulations showed that a significantly warmer (+6 °C) summer climate would cause expansion of forest through the Brooks Range onto the currently treeless North Slope only after a period of 3000–4000 yr. Substantial forest establishment on the North Slope didnot occur until temperatures warmed 9 °C, and only following a 2000 yr time lag. The long time lags between change in climate and change in vegetation indicate current global change predictions greatly over-estimate the response of vegetation to a warming climate in Alaska. In all the simulations warming caused a steady increase in the proportion of early successional deciduous forest. This would reduce the magnitude of the predicted decrease in regional albedo and the positive feedback to climate warming. Simulation of spruce forest refugia on the North Slope showed forest could survive with only a 4 °C warming and would greatly reduce the time lag of forest expansion under warmer climates. Planting of spruce on the North Slope by humans could increase the likelihood of large-scale colonization of currently treeless tundra. Together, the long time lag and deciduous forest dominance would delay the predicted positive regional feedback of vegetation change to climatic warming. These simulated changes indicate the Brooks Range would significantly constrain regional forest expansion under a warming climate, with similar implications for other regions possessing major east-west oriented mountain ranges. },

The paper is a step toward to the analysis of generic single-input systems affine in the control in dimension 3. The main techniques used are second-order optimality conditions and, in particular, the index of the second variation of the switching times for bang-bang trajectories. },

Forest canopy density, which has close relation to forest productivity, was selected as a key factor to find how much the forest quality was changed 13 years after fire, and how fire severity, regeneration way and terrain factors influenced the restoration of forest canopy density, based on forest inventory data in China, and using Kendall Bivariate Correlation Analysis, and Distances Correlation Analysis. The results showed that fire severity which was inversely correlated with forest canopy density grade was an initial factor among all that selected. Regeneration way which did not remarkably affect forest canopy density restoration in short period, may shorten the cycle of forest succession and promote the forest productivity of conophorium in the future. Among the three terrain factors, the effect of slope was the strongest, the position on slope was the second and the aspect was the last. },

Much larger problems are related to the pretreatment of soil samples for the PSDA. The diversity of existing methods, classification schemes, and technical devices based on different physical principles (sedimentation and laser diffractometry) should be taken into account in the analysis and quantitative conversion of particle-size distribution data from a given classification system into another system. The Russian classification of soil textures and soil particle-size groups developed by N.A. Kachinskii has certain advantages and can be easily converted into other systems.

The ductility increased with extrusion temperature (Text), reached a maximum at a Text of 200 °C, and at yet higher Text’s it rapidly decreased. The maximum tensile modulus and strength of 9.5 GPa and 410 MPa, respectively, were achieved for a highly drawn sc-film prepared by coextrusion at a Text of 200 °C and EDR of 16. Such a drawn film consisted of highly oriented sc-crystals and had a crystallinity of χc=59 wt % and a high chain orientation function of fc=0.993. The oriented sc-films exhibited remarkably enhanced heat-resistance compared to the oriented films of PLLA homo-polymer. The dynamic storage modulus of a sc-film with an EDR of 16, measured at 11 Hz, was 9.5 GPa at room temperature and 2.7 GPa even at 200 °C, 20–25 °C above the melting temperatures of α- and β-form homo-crystals. The high thermal stability of oriented sc-films was primarily ascribed to the high melting temperature and weak α-relaxation intensity for the sc-films compared to the PLLA films. No existence of a crystalline relaxation in the sc-films also contributed to improve their thermal stability. },

Compared with the binary blend, the addition of TPEg significantly affected the crystallization behaviors of the individual component in the blends, especially those of PA6. The presence of TPEg weakened the nucleating role of the PA6 on the PP matrix. The increasing concentration of the compatibilizer caused a decrease in crystallization temperature (Tc) and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) associated with PA6. When TPEg amount was added up to 24 wt %, the crystallization of PA6 at its bulk Tc was almost completely suppressed and the complete concurrent crystallization of PA6 and PP matrix took place. In the case of PP/PA6/TPEg blend containing 24 wt % TPEg, it was found that the disappearance of bulk PA6 crystallization peak was independent of the cooling rate and annealing time, but can be introduced by self-nucleation experiments. The above fractionated crystallization phenomenon was attributed to the reduction in PA6 particle size due to compatibilization role of added TPEg, which leads to the lack of the active heterogeneities. The crystalline morphologies under isothermal conditions were also observed by polarized optical microscopy (POM). },

These features are somehow integrated into percepts. Despite many years of research, a convincing candidate for such a feature in primary auditory cortex has not been found. We argue that feature detection is actually a secondary issue in understanding the role of primary auditory cortex. Instead, the major contribution of primary auditory cortex to auditory perception is in processing previously derived features on a number of different timescales. We hypothesize that, as a result, neurons in primary auditory cortex represent sounds in terms of auditory objects rather than in terms of feature maps. According to this hypothesis, primary auditory cortex has a pivotal role in the auditory system in that it generates the representation of auditory objects to which higher auditory centers assign properties such as spatial location, source identity, and meaning. },

  abstract={ An experimental investigation of a shock-induced interfacial instability (Richtmyer-Meshkov instability) is undertaken in an effort to study temporal evolution of interfacial perturbations in the late stages of development. The experiments are performed in a vertical shock tube with a square cross-section. A membraneless interface is prepared by retracting a sinusoidally shaped metal plate initially separating carbon dioxide from air, with both gases initially at atmospheric pressure. With carbon dioxide above the plate, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability commences as the plate is retracted and the amplitude of the initial sinusoidal perturbation imposed on the interface begins to grow. The interface is accelerated by a strong shock wave (M = 3.08) while its shape is still sinusoidal and before the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability distorts it into the well known mushroom-like structures; its initial amplitude to wavelength ratio is large enough that the interface evolution enters its nonlinear stage very shortly after shock acceleration. The pre-shock evolution of the interface due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the post-shock evolution of the interface due to the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability are visualized using planar Mie scattering. The pre-shock evolution of the interface is carried out in an independent set of experiments. The initial conditions for the Richtmyer-Meshkov experiment are determined from the pre-shock Rayleigh-Taylor growth. One image of the post-shock interface is obtained per experiment and image sequences, showing the post-shock evolution of the interface, are constructed from several experiments. The growth rate of the perturbation amplitude is measured and compared with two recent analytical models of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. },

  abstract={ We present a redescription for Paranoplocephala macrocephala (Douthitt, 1915) in the type host, Geomys bursarius (Shaw) (hereafter PMG), and compare it with a P.&nbsp;macrocephala-like taxon in Microtus pennsylvanicus (Ord) (hereafter PMM) and P.&nbsp;kalelai (Tenora, Haukisalmi &amp; Henttonen, 1985) in Clethrionomys rufocanus (Sundevall) using uni- and multivariate (discriminant analysis) morphometric methods. P.&nbsp;kalelai was found to be most divergent among these three taxa using both uni- and multivariate analyses, supporting its status as an independent species. Most of the observed metrical differences between PMG and PMM were found to reflect the larger body size of PMM; the relative size of organs (ratios) did not usually differ significantly between these taxa. The length/width ratio of mature segments was found to be the only size-independent feature that reliably separates PMG and PMM. Since PMM and PMG are also qualitatively very similar, e.g. with respect to the distribution of testes and morphology of the terminal genital ducts, the present analysis could not provide conclusive evidence against their conspecificity. However, the morphological variability and wide host and geographical distribution of P.&nbsp;macrocephala-like cestodes in North American voles of the genus Microtus, and the patterns of host-specificity within Paranoplocephala, suggest that this complex probably includes several species. },

  abstract={ We evaluated spatial patterns of soil N and C mineralization, microbial community composition (phospholipid fatty acids), and local site characteristics (plant/forest floor cover, soil pH, soil %C and %N) in a 0.25-ha burned black spruce forest stand in interior Alaska. Results indicated that factors governing soil N and C mineralization varied at two different scales. In situ net N mineralization was autocorrelated with microbial community composition at relatively broad scales (∼ ∼8&nbsp;m) and with local site characteristics (`site' axis 1 of non-metric scaling ordination) at relatively fine scales (2–4&nbsp;m). At the scale of the individual core, soil moisture was the best predictor of in situ net N mineralization and laboratory C mineralization, explaining between 47 and 67% of the variation (p&nbsp;&lt; 0.001). Ordination of microbial lipid data showed that bacteria were more common in severely burned microsites, whereas fungi were more common in low fire severity microsites. We conclude that C and N mineralization rates in this burned black spruce stand were related to different variables depending on the scale of analysis, suggesting the importance of considering multiple scales of variability among key drivers of C and N transformations. },

  abstract={ Src, a proto-oncogene, has been strongly implicated in the growth, progression and metastasis of a number of human cancers. Its role in lung cancer is, however, still unknown. In the present study, we assessed the expression of Src in three different human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC-9, PC14PE6, A549), and explored the effect of a novel Src kinase inhibitor, M475271, on the behavior of the cell lines. The three cell lines expressed various levels of auto-phosphorylated Src. While M475271 reduced Src-phosphorylation and invasiveness of all three cell lines, it inhibited the proliferation of PC-9 and A549 cells with highly phosphorylated Src, but not PC14PE6 cells. We further examined the effect of M475271 on subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis caused by PC-9 and/or A549 cells in NK-cell depleted SCID mice. Daily oral treatment with M475271 inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors with PC-9 and A549 cells via inhibition of tumor cells proliferation, VEGF production and/or vascularization in the mice in a dose-dependent manner. In the metastasis model with A549 cells, the lung weight in the M475271 (50&nbsp;mg/kg)-treated group was less than that of the control group, despite no difference in the number of metastatic nodules. Our results suggest that inhibition of tyrosine kinase Src by M475271 could reduce the growth, invasion and VEGF-mediated neovascularization of lung adenocarcinoma cells, resulting in inhibition of growth of subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis. Therefore, a novel Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, M475271, might be helpful for controlling the progression of human lung adenocarcinoma. },

TOD was formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PR3 (NRRL B-18602) in a culture supplied with exogenous ricinoleic acid. The yield of TOD production was always higher in a rich culture medium than in minimal screening medium. Extending the conversion time from 48 to 72 h prior to lipid extraction led to a 65% reduction in yield, indicating that TOD was further metabolized by strain PR3 and that control of reaction time is important to achieving a maximum yield. The optimum culture density, reaction time, pH, temperature, and substrate concentration for the production of TOD were: 20–24 h culture growth, 48 h, 7.0, 25°C, and 1% (vol/vol), respectively. Under optimum conditions, the yield of TOD production was greater than 45%. TOD was found to be an antifungal agent most active against the fungus that causes blast disease in rice plants, the most important fungal disease affecting rice production worldwide. },

  abstract={ The cloning of a G protein-coupled, extracellular Ca2+ (Ca o 2+ )-sensing receptor (CaR) has afforded a molecular basis for a number of the known effects of Ca o 2+ on tissues involved in maintaining systemic calcium homeostasis, especially parathyroid gland and kidney. In addition to providing molecular tools for showing that CaR messenger RNA and protein are present within these tissues, the cloned CaR has permitted documentation that several human diseases are the result of inactivating or activating mutations of this receptor as well as generation of mice that have targeted disruption of the CaR gene. Characteristic changes in the functions of parathyroid and kidney in these patients as well as in the CaR “knockout” mice have elucidated considerably the CaR’s physiological roles in mineral ion homeostasis. Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be learned about how this receptor regulates the functioning of other tissues involved in Ca o 2+ metabolism, such as bone and intestine. Further study of these human diseases and of the mouse models will doubtless be useful in gaining additional understanding of the CaR’s roles in these latter tissues. Furthermore, we understand little of the CaR’s functions in tissues that are not directly involved in systemic mineral ion metabolism, where the receptor probably serves diverse other roles. Some of these functions may be related to the control of intra- and local extracellular concentrations of Ca2+, while others may be unrelated to either systemic or local ionic homeostasis. In any case, the CaR and conceivably additional receptors/sensors for Ca2+ or other extracellular ions represent versatile regulators of a wide variety of cellular functions and represent important targets for novel classes of therapeutics. },

Findings supported our expectations that positive and negative emotions classified as active would be more strongly related to interpersonally-directed ethical choices than to organizationally-directed ones, and that passive emotions would be less related to ethical choices than active emotions.

  abstract={ The availability and spatial arrangement of habitat patches are known to strongly influence fauna in terrestrial ecosystems. The importance of patch arrangement is not well-studied within running-water systems where flow-induced movements of patches and of fauna could decouple habitat characteristics and faunal habitat preferences. Using small, stream-dwelling invertebrates, we asked if fauna in such systems can distinguish among patch types and if patch arrangement at their `landscape scale' (i.e., within a streambed across which they move and forage) can be linked to faunal abundance. We quantified the spatial distribution of sand and leaf patches at multiple sites on a streambed at regular intervals over a 1 $$\frac{1}{2}$$ yr period, estimated faunal abundance in the two patch types, and experimentally determined if faunal colonization varied among leaf patches that were similar structurally but differed in their potential microbial food resources. We show that despite their small size and limited swimming abilities, these stream invertebrates did respond to patch type, that specific characteristics of an individual patch influenced faunal colonization, and that the spatial arrangement of patches on the streambed was linked to field abundances. Larval chironomids and adult copepods were more abundant in leaves than in sand and preferentially colonized leaf patches made with rapidly decomposing leaves that harbored higher microbial (bacteria and fungi) abundances over leaf patches with more refractory leaves and lower microbial abundances. Further, statistical models that included spatially-explicit data on patch arrangement (e.g., patch contagion, distance between patches) explained significantly more variation in faunal abundance, than models that included only nonspatial information (e.g., date, time since last flood). Despite the fact that these fauna live in a highly dynamic environment with variable flow rates during the year, unstable patch configurations, and seasonal changes in total abundance, our findings suggest a need for aquatic ecologists to test the hypothesis that small-scale landscape attributes within streams (e.g., leaf patch aggregation) may be important to faunal dynamics. If patch aggregation has negative consequences for stream biota, streambed `landscapes' may be fundamentally different from many terrestrial landscapes due to the inherent connectivity provided by the water and the over-riding importance of patch edges. Regardless of these differences, our findings suggest that the spatial configuration of patches in a landscape may have consequences for fauna even in highly dynamic systems, in which patches move and fauna periodically experience high levels of passive dispersal. },

The crystallinity of brown cotton was similar to that of white cotton, and bombax cotton had the lowest crystallinity but its crystallite orientation was the highest. Thermal property of bottle green cotton was the most stable, whose decomposition temperature was higher of 30°C than that of common white cotton because of its higher lignin content, and bombax cotton had the lowest thermal degradation temperature. But bottle green cotton reached the highest decomposition speed and made decomposition finish within a very short time, and bombax cotton was just the reverse. },

  abstract={ We determined concentrations of peramine, the only alkaloid produced by Neotyphodium-infected (E+) Arizona fescue plants (of the four major types typically assayed in infected grasses), in a long-term field experiment. Four plant genotypes with (E+) and without (experimentally removed, E−) their respective haplotypes (two haplotypes in two plant genotypes) of Neotyphodium were grown in the field under manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Peramine production required the presence of the endophyte; plants without their endophytes did not contain peramine. Whereas the endophyte was necessary for peramine production, levels of peramine did not vary by Neotyphodium haplotype within plant genotypes. Furthermore, peramine levels did not differ among soil moisture and nutrient treatments, and growth and reproductive measures of the host grass explained little of variation in peramine levels. Instead, peramine levels differed significantly between plant genotypes harboring the same endophyte haplotype, suggesting that plant genotype, rather than endophyte haplotype or environment, largely determines levels of peramine in Arizona fescue. The results suggest that whereas the endophyte is required for peramine production, the plant genotypic background in which the endophyte is embedded, rather than endophyte haplotype or environmental factors, mostly influences peramine levels within this population of Arizona fescue. },

  abstract={ Landscape patterns of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedling occurrence and abundance were studied after a rare recruitment event following the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Belt transects (1 to 17 km in length, 4 m width) along 18 foot trails were surveyed for aspen seedlings on the subalpine plateau of the Park, along gradients of elevation and geologic substrate, during the summer of 1996. Aspen seedling presence and density were characterized as a function of elevation, geologic substrate, slope, aspect, vegetation/cover type, presence of burned forest, and distance to nearest adult aspen stand. Presence of aspen seedlings was best predicted by the incidence of burned forest and proximity to adult aspen; aspen seedlings were only found in burned forest and were more likely to occur closer to adult aspen clones. When tested against independent data collected in 1997, the logistic regression model for aspen seedling presence performed well (overall accuracy = 73%, Taup = 0.41). When present, variation in aspen seedling density at local scales (≤ 200 m) was largely explained by elevation, with higher densities observed at lower elevations. At broad scales (&gt; 1 km), seedling density was a function of cover type, elevation, aspect, slope, and burn severity, with greater seedling density in more severely burned forested habitats on southerly, shallow slopes at lower elevations. Aspen seedling densities ranged from 0 to 46,000 seedlings/ha with a median density of 2,000/ha on sites where they occurred. Aspen seedlings were most abundant in the south central and southwest central regions of the park, approximately an order of magnitude less abundant in the southeast region, and nearly absent in the north central area. Establishment of new aspen stands on Yellowstone's subalpine plateau would represent a substantial change in the landscape. However, the long-term fate of these postfire aspen seedlings is not known. },

  abstract={ Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and vascular complications of diabetes. However, the precise mechanisms by which ROS contribute to the development of these diseases are not fully characterized. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a ROS, has been shown to activate several signaling protein kinases, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and protein kinase B (PKB) in different cell types, notably in vascular smooth muscle cells. Because these pathways regulate cellular mitogenesis, migration, proliferation, survival, and death responses, their aberrant activtion has been suggested to be a potential mechanism of ROS-induced pathologies. The upstream elements responsible for H2O2-induced ERK1/2 and PKB activation remain poorly characterized, but a potential role of receptor and nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) as triggers that initiate such events has been postulated. Therefore, the aim of this review is to highlight the involvement of receptor and nonreceptor PTKs in modulating H2O2-induced ERK1/2 and PKB signaling. },

Grain yield and 1000-kernel weight had higher values of narrow sense heritability (hn2=0,56, hn2=0,5) than expected. Ear row number(hn2=0,45) had lower.

  abstract={ A great deal of violence in civil wars is informed by the logic of terrorism: violence tends to be used by political actors against civilians in order to shape their political behavior. I focus on indiscriminate violence in the context of civil war: this is a type of violence that selects its victims on the basis of their membership in some group and irrespective of their individual actions. Extensive empirical evidence suggests that indiscriminate violence in civil war is informed by the logic of terrorism. I argue that under certain conditions, that tend to be quite common, such violence is counter productive. I specify these conditions and address the following paradox: why do we sometimes observe instances of indiscriminate violence evenunder conditions that make this strategy counterproductive? I review four possible reasons: truncated data, ignorance, cost, and institutional constraints. I argue that indiscriminate violence emerges because it is much cheaper than its main alternative – selective violence. It is more likely under a steep imbalance of power between the competing actors, and where and when resources and information are low; however, most political actors eventually switch to selective violence. Thus, given a balance of power between competing actors, indiscriminate violence is more likely at early rather than late stages of the conflict. Overall, the paper suggests that even extreme forms of violence are used strategically. },

Eleven plots in six montane forest patches were sampled from February-October, 1994. Six species were captured, including four rodents and two shrews. PROGRAM CAPTURE was used to derive estimates of density of the most abundant species in the study area,Rattus rattus Linnaeus. The coefficient of variation of the density estimate was used as an index of precision. The coefficient of variation decreased exponentially with increasing capture probability and with an increase in trapping duration. The coefficient of variation and the capture probability were not correlated with estimates of density. The density estimate increased with trapping duration, as did trap mortality. The latter may have been due to the trend of increased mortality with recaptures of the same individual, which in turn may have been due to weight loss over consecutive captures. Estimates of density derived using four estimators were different for 2, 3, 4 and 5 days of trapping. The coefficient of variation was highest for the generalized removal estimate and lowest for Darroch’s estimate. The models and estimators could not be applied to more than one species, and for this species, only in select habitats in a few seasons. Therefore, models of density estimation developed for temperate areas may not be suitable for tropical habitats due to low densities of small mammals in these habitats. },

At the same time, the effect of naturally occurring variations in heartwood extractives on termite or decay resistance was evaluated by testing samples from the inner and outer heartwood of five trees of each species against C. formosanus and P. placenta and analyzing matched wood samples for their extractive content. The results suggest that the methanol-soluble extractives in T. plicata and C. nootkatensis play an important role in heartwood resistance to attack by C. formosanus and P. placenta. Total methanol-soluble extractive content of the heartwood was positively correlated with both termite and decay resistance; however, there was much unexplained variation and levels of individual extractive components were only weakly correlated with one another. Further studies are under way to develop a better understanding of the relationships between individual extractive levels and performance. },

We have developed an aggregation index (AI) that is class specific and independent of landscape composition. AI assumes that a class with the highest level of aggregation (AI =1) is comprised of pixels sharing the most possible edges. A class whose pixels share no edges (completely disaggregated) has the lowest level of aggregation (AI =0). AI is similar to SI and Qi, but it calculates aggregation more precisely than the latter two. We have evaluated the performance of AI under varied levels of (1) aggregation, (2) number of patches, (3) spatial resolutions, and (4) real species distribution maps at various spatial scales. AI was able to produce reasonable results under all these circumstances. Since it is class specific, it is more precise than CI, which measures overall landscape aggregation. Thus, AI provides a quantitative basis to correlate the spatial pattern of a class with a specific process. Since AI is a ratio variable, map units do not affect the calculation. It can be compared between classes from the same or different landscapes, or even the same classes from the same landscape under different resolutions. },

  abstract={ The relations between disturbance regime and landscape patterns have been developed from a theoretical perspective, but few studies have tested these relations when forces promoting opposing heterogeneity patterns are simultaneously operating on a landscape. This work provides quantitative evidence of these relations in areas dominated by human activity, showing that landscape heterogeneity decreases disturbance spread. In turn, disturbance introduces a source of landscape heterogeneity, but it is not enough to counterbalance the homogeneity trend due to agricultural abandonment. Land cover changes and wildfire occurrence (fires larger than 0.3 km2) have been monitored in the Tivissa municipality (208.4 km2) (Catalonia, NE Spain) from 1956 to 1993. Land cover maps were obtained from 1956, 1978 and 1993 and they were overlaid with fire occurrence maps obtained for the 1975–1995 period from 60 m resolution remote sensing images, which allow the identification of burned areas by sudden drops in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Changes in landscape patterns in relation to fire regime have been analyzed considering several parameters: patch density, mean patch size, mean distance to the nearest neighbour of the same category, edge density, and the Shannon diversity index. In the 1956–1993 period there is a trend to increasing landscape homogenization due to the expansion of shrub­lands linked to a decrease in forest surface, and to the abandonment of agricultural lands. This trend, however, is not constant along all the period. Fires are more likely to occur in woody, homogenous areas, increasing landscape heterogeneity, as observed in the 1978–1993 period. This increase in heterogeneity does not counterbalance the general trend to landscape homogenization as a consequence of agricultural abandonment and the coalescence of natural vegetation patches. },

  abstract={ A new modified random clusters method for the simulation of landscape the matic spatial patterns is presented. It produces more realistic and general results than landscape models that have been commonly used to date in the field of landscape ecology. Simulated patterns are said to be realistic, apart from their patchy and irregular appearance, because the values of the spatial indices as a function of habitat abundance measured in real landscape patterns (number of patches, edge length and patch cohesion index) can be replicated with the proposed landscape model. It allows a wide range of spatial patterns to be obtained, in which fragmentation and habitat abundance can be systematically and independently varied. Furthermore, a degree of control over the irregularity of the shapes of the simulated landscapes can be achieved, and it is also possible to simulate patterns with anisotropy. The proposed method is easy to implement and requires little computation time, which enhances the practical possibilities of this method in different areas of landscape ecology. },

  abstract={ Spatio-temporal heterogeneity in physico-chemical conditions associated with the annual expansion/contraction cycle in a complex glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps was investigated employing a landscape approach. The diverse and dynamic aquatic habitats of the flood plain were visualized as an aquatic mosaic or riverscape. Based on samples collected at ca. monthly intervals for 1.5&nbsp;yr along 17 floodplain transects, the 3 components of riverscape heterogeneity, extent, composition, and configuration, were quantified using categorical maps and indices of landscape patterns for turbidity and specific conductance. Changes in the spatial heterogeneity of 13 other physico-chemical parameters were further analyzed by means of a within-dates principal component analysis. Riverscape heterogeneity (RH), quantified by applying several indices of landscape pattern to turbidity and specific conductance data, was minimum during groundwater-dominated base flow in winter. Despite an increase in surface connectivity in the channel network with rising discharge, RH rose in spring and summer as additional chemically-distinct water sources (i.e., snowmelt runoff and glacial ablation) contributed to surface flow within the flood plain. Most other physico-chemical variables measured during this study exhibited the same spatio-temporal heterogeneity as turbidity and specific conductance. Overall, the glacial flood plain shifted from a monotonous physico-chemical riverscape in winter to a complex mosaic in summer, this seasonal pattern being clearly driven by hydrological factors operating at the catchment scale rather than by autogenic processes within individual water bodies. Although RH exhibited a predictable annual pattern in response to the seasonal flow regime, we expect the channel network to undergo future modifications from stochastic factors associated with flood events and long-term changes reflecting movements of the glaciers. },

  abstract={ An explicitly spatial, large scale, high resolution model of fire driven landscape dynamics in the Great Victoria Desert is constructed and parameterized to simulate frequency distributions of fire size and shape obtained from previous analyses of satellite chronosequences. We conclude that probabilities of fire spread cannot be constant over time, and that realistic distributions of fire size and plausible rates of fire spread can be obtained by assuming that fire spread is conditional on observed durations of windy conditions. Landscapes subject to this form of disturbance show large scale correlation structure many times greater than the average dimensions of single fires, and exhibit low frequency quasi-periodic stochastically driven oscillations in proportions of the landscape at different successional states over spatial scales exceeding 100,000&nbsp;km2. Average fire return intervals are ∼30 yrs. Analysis of patch structure suggests that this landscape is composed of few large younger patches, embedded in a mature sea of surrounding habitat. Intermediate and late successional habitat must exist in more abundant patches somewhat smaller than young habitat. Numerous small patches of mature habitat are likely to be scattered throughout this younger habitat. The model predicts that fire size frequency distributions are relatively insensitive to changes of as much as ±50% of observed fire ignition frequency. },

This paper presents a study of the relationships between landscape structure and species diversity distribution (estimated in terms of richness of birds, amphibians, reptiles and butterflies) in the region of Madrid, Spain. The results show that the response of species richness to landscape heterogeneity varies depending on the group of species considered. For birds and lepidopterans, the most important factor affecting the distribution of richness of species is landscape heterogeneity, while other factors, such as the specific composition of land use, play a secondary role at this scale. On the other hand, richness of amphibians and reptiles is more closely related to the abundance of certain land-use types. The study highlights the importance of heterogeneity in Mediterranean landscapes as a criterion for landscape planning and for definition of management directives in order to maintain biodiversity. },

While all penguins left the colony in an easterly direction and traveled clockwise back to the island, three penguins foraged in the northern parts of the general foraging area and stayed north of 56°S. The remaining 20 penguins ventured south and most crossed 59°S before returning to the island. The total foraging area was estimated to be 156,000 km2 with 36,500 km2 being most important (where penguins spent &gt;150 hr in total). North-foraging penguins reached on average 331 ± 24 km from the colony compared to 530 ± 76 km for the south-foraging penguins. The latter traveled an average total distance of 1313 ± 176 km, while the northern foragers averaged 963 ± 166 km. Not only did the penguins spend the majority of their foraging time within the boundaries of the proposed MPA, they also foraged chiefly within the boundaries of a highly protected zone. Thus, the MPA is likely to encompass the foraging zone of king penguins, at least during incubation. },

  abstract={ This paper presents a nearest neighbor method for the spatial analysis of data collected from discrete field sampling sites. The method was applied to point counts of birds at permanent survey sites in the Nicolet National Forest of northeastern Wisconsin. The spatial analysis method we developed uses a Monte Carlo randomization approach to test for non-randomness not only of the mean nearest neighbor distance between n points but also the mean second nearest, third nearest,..., to (n−1)th nearest distances to reveal spatial information at multiple scales. Because the bird survey sites are not randomly distributed throughout the forest, the survey sites at which a given species was recorded were compared with random samples drawn from the total survey sites rather than from all possible points within the forest. More refined analyses restricted the randomization by (a) habitat type, in order to separate the effects of non-randomly distributed habitat types on species' distributions; and (b) north-south regions of the forest, in order to account for regional gradients in distribution which were evident for some species. Spatial patterns among the sites at which the birds were detected reveal information about the scale at which the birds are distributed in their environment and provide a more complete picture of multi-scale bird population dynamics. },

Transient expression of uidA was improved when detached cotyledons were pre-cultured on half strength medium containing cytokinin for 7 days, wounded by vortexing and then vacuum-infiltrated in a solution of A. tumefaciens. The transformation protocol was applied both to cotyledons and also to the apical meristematic dome which was the portion of the embryo remaining after cotyledons were detached, and from which the apical shoot and axillary shoots regenerate. Molecular analysis of putatively transformed shoots regenerated either adventitiously from cotyledons or via axillary shoots from apical domes, indicated the presence of uidA and nptII genes by PCR in some of these shoots. Biochemical analysis of putatively transformed shoots using nptII ELISA indicated that they contained the nptII enzyme. However, Southern hybridisation indicated stable integration of nptII only in one shoot which was regenerated from an apical dome. Shoots regenerated from cotyledons appeared to exhibit chimeric expression and were not stably transformed. Based on a comparison of time for regeneration, technical difficulty, molecular and biochemical analysis, apical domes may be more suitable as explants for transformation and subsequent regeneration of transclones than detached cotyledons. },

  abstract={ Three non-specific methods for the extraction of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) from soil into organic solvent were compared. The techniques used for sample preparation were Soxhlet extraction, closed-vessel microwave-assisted extraction, and CEN shake extraction. The total concentrations of extracted compounds in the boiling point range of C10–C40 were determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The best recovery (99%) and repeatability (±3%) from standard oil mixtures were obtained with microwave-assisted extraction. However, the different extraction methods exhibited different behaviour when spiked soil samples were extracted. The best repeatability was obtained with CEN shake extraction (±6%) but the repeatability values for Soxhlet and microwave-assisted methods were quite high (&gt;20%). However, the larger uncertainties of the latter extraction methods does not necessarily limit the applicability of these methods to the determination of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil, as in the assessment of soil contamination the expanded uncertainty of the result is usually not limited by analytical uncertainty, but rather by the uncertainty of the primary sampling stage. However, distinctive variation found in the chromatographic profiles illustrates that discretion should be obeyed when chromatograms obtained after application of different extraction methods on petroleum contaminated samples are to be used in the fingerprinting or age dating studies. Otherwise, misleading conclusions concerning the age of spillage could be drawn. },

Of these measures, biotechnology applications probably hold the most promise in augmenting conventional agricultural productivity, because biotechnology applications give not only the need to increase production, but also protect the environment and conserving natural resources for future generations. Biotechnology applications will have the possibilities to increase productivity and food availability through better agronomic performance of new varieties, including resistance to pests; rapid multiplication of disease-free plants; ability to obtain natural plant products using tissue culture; diagnosis of diseases of plants and livestock; manipulation of reproduction methods increasing the efficiency of breeding; and the provision of incentives for greater participation by the private sector through investments. Insect resistance through the transfer of a gene for resistance fromBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is one of the most advanced biotechnology applications already being commercialized in many parts of the world.

The highest frequency (27.8%) of GUS expressing embryos was obtained from genotype E-Mc with mean number of 21.9 blue GUS spots per embryo. Expression of β-glucuronidase reporter gene was observed on cotyledons, hypocotyls, and radicles of transformed mature zygotic embryos, as well as on organogenic callus and regenerated shoots derived from co-cultivated mature zygotic embryos. Nineteen regenerated transgenic plants were obtained from GUS expression and kanamycin resistant calli. The presence and integration of the GUS gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis. These results suggested that an efficientAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation protocol for stable integration of foreign genes into loblolly pine has been developed and that this transformation system could be useful for the future studies on transferring economically important genes to loblolly pine. },

Our purpose was to categorize phytoplankton nutrient status in this under-represented region of North America and to improve our ability to predict the response of primary production to anticipated anthropogenically mediated increases in nutrient loading. Experiments were performed across several watersheds and included assays on terminal lakes and lakes occupying various positions in chains (lakes in series within a watershed and connected by streams). In total, 89% (48 of 54) of the bioassays showed significant stimulation of 14C primary production by some form of nutrient addition relative to unamended controls. A significant response was observed following enrichment with N and P, N alone and P alone in 83, 35 and 22% of the bioassays, respectively. In experiments where N and P proved stimulatory, the influence of N alone was significantly greater than the influence of P alone. Overall, the data point to a greater importance for N than P in regulating phytoplankton production in this region. The degree of response to N and P enrichment declined as the summer progressed and showed no relationship to irradiance or water temperature, suggesting secondary limitation by some micronutrient such as iron as the summer advanced. Phytoplankton nutrient status was often consistent across lakes within a watershed, suggesting that watershed characteristics influence nutrient availability. Lakes in this region will clearly show increased phytoplankton production in response to anthropogenic activities and anticipated changes in climate that will increase nutrient loading. },

The study was carried out on three soils with identical origin but covered with different forest species: pine, eucalyptus, and a typical Atlantic-humid riverside forest. Some other physical, chemical and biological properties and environmental parameters, mainly humidity and environmental temperature, were considered to analyze their influence on soil microbial activity. The study was performed using a microcalorimeter Thermal Analysis Monitor 2277 in which the experiments were carried out with 1 g soil samples treated with 1.25 mg glucose g–1 soil.

These results are dependent on the remaining physical, chemical and biological features analysed and because of this, pine forest soil, with a pH value 3.3 in spring, shows a small capacity to maintain a stable microbial population which is the lowest of the three (0.079·108 to 0.46·108 microorganisms g–1 soil) while riverside soil microbial population is in the range from 7.9·108 to 17·108 microorganisms g–1 soil. },

Recent studies have used increasingly complex neutral models that incorporate contagion and other constraints on random patterns, as well as using neutral landscapes as input to spatial simulation models. Here, I consider a common mathematical framework based on spectral transforms that represents all neutral landscape models in terms of sets of spectral basis functions. Fractal and multi-fractal models are considered, as well as models with multiple scaling regions and anisotropy. All of the models considered are shown to be variations on a basic theme: a scaling relation between frequency and amplitude of spectral components. Two example landscapes examined showed long-range correlations (distances up to 1000&nbsp;km) consistent with fractal scaling. },

  abstract={ Ecotones are inherent features of landscapes, transitional zones, and play more than one functional role in ecosystem dynamics. The delineation of ecotones and environmental boundaries is therefore an important step in land-use management planning. The delineation of ecotones depends on the phenomenon of interest and the statistical methods used as well as the associated spatial and temporal resolution of the data available. In the context of delineating wetland and riparian ecosystems, various data types (field data, remotely sensed data) can be used to delineate ecotones. Methodological issues related to their detection need to be addressed, however, so that their management and monitoring can yield useful information about their dynamics and functional roles in ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to review boundary detection methods. Because the most appropriate methods to detect and characterize boundaries depend of the spatial resolution and the measurement type of the data, a wide range of approaches are presented: GIS, remote sensing and statistical ones. },

A comparative analysis was carried out for the different filtered RTP aeromagnetic and gravity maps. Statistical trend analysis was applied for the magnetic and gravity data. The study revealed that the area has been affected by three significant tectonic trends, namely; NE-SW, NW-SE and E-W. The RTP aeromagnetic map and Bouguer anomaly maps provided detailed data for 2d modeling of the source. The magnetic and gravity cross section indicates possible sources of the observed anomalies. Only depth of the anomaly sources (mostly in the basement) were determined from magnetic and gravity data to reveal a tectonic zone and structure which leads to a fluid migration.

Ten plants in each of two tall larkspur populations in the mountains near Ferron and Salina, Utah, were marked, and single stalks were harvested periodically through the growing season for 4 yr. Toxic alkaloid concentration [alkaloids containing the N-(methylsuccimimido)-anthranilik ester group] was determined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Individual larkspur plants varied in alkaloid concentrations, especially in early growth (14–38 mg/g). As the concentration declined over the growing season, variation among plants also declined. There were yearly differences in alkaloid concentration among individual plants (P &lt; 0.01) and populations (P &lt; 0.001), even after accounting for differences in phenological growth between years. Variables such as precipitation, temperature, days since snow melt, growing degree days (sum of mean temperature each day from snow melt), and plant height and weight were all considered in a Mallows Cp multiple regression selection procedure to predict alkaloid concentration. The mixed model procedure in SAS adjusted the regression equation for locations and years. Growing degree days was the best single predictor of alkaloid levels: ln y = (3.581 − 0.00423 GDD), R 2 = 0.85. Internal validation of this equation within individual years and locations from which the equation was developed, produced correlations between observed versus predicted values ranging from r = 0.73 to 0.93. External validations on nine other larkspur populations produced correlations ranging from r = 0.76 to 0.99. This predictive equation can provide a tool for ranchers and land managers to make management decisions of when to graze cattle in larkspur areas. },

  abstract={ Strategies for protecting and restoring riparian and stream ecosystems commonly encounter uncertainties about natural processes and management practices that contribute to environmental disturbances. Improvements in management plans require landscape approaches that account for the explicit spatial distribution and variability of different land cover types that can contribute to unstable conditions. We use a spatially explicit procedure to determine erosion-risk indices and variable riparian buffer widths in watersheds. The indices are based on land cover types that can contribute to erosion either alone or collectively. Land cover information (e.g., unstable soils, immature forest stands, roads, critical slope for land failure and rain-on-snow areas) was used to estimate erosion-risk indices. Erosion-risk indices increase with greater co-occurrences of contributing land covers. The procedure was used to identify erosion-prone areas in tributary watersheds of the Beckler-Rapid River drainage (260&nbsp;km2), in the State of Washington, USA. A regression analysis of the relationship between mean sediment inputs to streams and erosion-risk indices of sixteen different watersheds indicated that erosion-risk indices explained 65% of the variation associated with sediment inputs to channels. Landscape maps of erosion-risk categories, based on ranges of erosion-risk indices, allowed spatially explicit definitions of stream reach lengths susceptible to different levels of erosion. Low to high-risk categories, and reach lengths vulnerable to erosion, also permitted the identification of the distribution of channels requiring protection by variable riparian buffers widths. The applicability of the procedure to other landscapes was demonstrated by estimating erosion risk-indices and variable riparian buffer widths for watersheds in the upper Cedar River drainage near Seattle, Washington. This approach allows watershed managers to use existing records and published information to address environmental problems within highly variable landscapes. },

The aim of this prospective study was to examine the effectiveness of antisecretory treatment, after successful H. pylori eradication, in preventing GERD, since no data exist so far. Eighty initially H. pylori(+) patients, without GERD at the time of H. pylori eradication [50 peptic ulcer (PU) and 30 nonulcer (NU), 55 men, 25 women, median age 38 years, range 19–57], after successful H. pylori eradication were randomized to recieve either omeprazole 20 mg daily (group A) or no treatment (group B) for one year. All patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 0, 6, and 12 months or when GERD symptoms occurred. There were 40 patients in each group, and there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of sex, age, body weight, ulcer/no ulcer ratio, and other demographic data. Seven patients from group A and five patients from group B were lost to follow-up, and therefore there were 33 and 35 patients in groups A and B, respectively, who completed the study. One of 33 patients in group A (3%) and 10/35 (28.5%) in group B developed GERD symptoms during follow-up (P = 0.0022). The respective values for esophagitis were 0/33(0%) and 6/35(17.1%) (P = 0.0083). In conclusion, antisecretory treatment in H. pylori(+) patients, after successful eradication, is effective in preventing GERD. },

  abstract={ The aim of this study was to analyze the main processes that determine changes in landscape patterns and vegetation cover from 1957-1994 to develop a model for land cover dynamics. Land cover and landscape patterns were assessed and compared using aerial photographs taken in 1957, 1985, and 1994. Over this period, tall grass steppe and arid garrigues increased by 6% and 4%, respectively, while crop fields decreased by 15% and tall arid brush remained the same. Over the same period, tall grass steppes and arid garrigues became less fragmented. Changes in land use were triggered by socioeconomic forces, which were constrained by the underlying structure of the physical landscape. The best preserved vegetation (tall arid brushes) was concentrated at higher elevations, with a pronounced slope, not oriented towards the sea, and in volcanic substrate. Communities tended to be better preserved further away from towns and at lower house densities. Tall grass steppe was present on more gradual sea-oriented slope and in calcareous substrate, and increased at higher elevations, although not far from the town but away from high anthropogenic influence. Previous studies have revealed that traditional land uses of this landscape, particularly grazing, favoured the transition from tall arid brush to tall grass steppe. In this study, we analyzed to what extent the underlying structure of the physical landscape imposes limitations to the vulnerability to human activity of the main vegetation types. According to the data on the probability of vegetation transition over the 37-year period, the shift from tall arid brush to tall grass steppe appeared to be favoured by gradual slopes. Tall arid brush recovered from either arid garrigues or tall grass steppes at steeper slopes. Thus, steep terrain had a favourable effect on the formation of brushwood and more gradual terrain favoured tall grass steppe. The prevalent trends were confirmed by a projection of a transition matrix over 100 years. },

  abstract={ Preserving biodiversity implies the development of indicators to evaluate management practices and to identify critical thresholds and dynamics that modify ecosystems. This study was conducted in the Camargue Delta (South of France). Mediterranean wetlands represent great potential for biodiversity, and their natural dynamics are strongly influenced by water control. We hypothesized that human influence can be estimated by taking into account spatial patterns of human artifacts. We defined two types of landscape indicators of human pressure: the spatial density and the connectivity of the hydrologic network. Co-inertia analysis was used to explore the correlation between these indicators and aquatic macrophyte communities sampled in marshes. Results suggested that human action may strongly influence marsh aquatic macrophyte communities and affect ecological dynamics. Particularly, alteration of wetland integrity by water control may promote the replacement of specialized species by generalist and exotie species. The canal network seems to facilitate dispersion of Ludwigia peploides between marshes. This result confirmed the negative role of corridors in facilitating dispersion of exotic species from one patch to another. We found positive correlations between landscape indicators and macrophyte composition, which is consistent with the tested hypothesis. The density of hydraulic structure was revealed to be a relevant landscape predictor of marsh biological state. },

  abstract={ The behavioral dependence of vegetation simulation models for spatially heterogeneous grasslands on simulation resolution was investigated. The dependence can be largely attributed to the non-linearity of the models. We showed that increasing scale or decreasing spatial resolution tended to overestimate the changing rate of an ecosystem using our landscape simulation model for alkaline grasslands in northeast China. A technique for scaling up simulation models with diffusive transportation was developed in this study by means of expanding the nonlinear driving functions in the model. The analysis showed that a simulation model for spatially heterogeneous landscapes might necessitate modification of both its mathematical structure and parameterization when applied to different scales. The scaling coefficients derived in this study were shown to be proportional to the variances or covariance of the spatially referenced variables, and can be estimated by running the model at a fine resolution for selected samples of the coarser grid cells. The technique was applied to a grassland landscape in northeast China and the results were compared with five-year observations on community succession. The comparison indicated that the proposed technique could effectively reduce overall scaling error of the model by as much as 80%, depending on the scaling difference between the fine and the coarse resolutions as well as the sampling scheme used. },

  abstract={ Satellite tracking of whales was the aim of the ARGOCET program in the western Mediterranean Sea. With the tracking technology and the development of telemetry, we can study large mammals under natural conditions. In 1991, a satellite tracking during 42 days on a fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) was obtained. The Argos system allowed us to know the location of this tagged fin whale 263 times. In this study, we can distinguish two kinds of movements: linear segments and tortuous segments with loops drawn in a clockwise direction. Such loops may be superficial oscillations of inertia due to the inertia of the water mass combined with earth's rotation. With this trial study, which is the best we have obtained, we can estimate the fractal dimension d of this trajectory at different observation scales. These d values seem to be scale-independent, so the fin whale path is fractal-like or scale-independent. Fractal dimension, which is a scale-independent measure, summarizes interactions between an organism and its ecosystem and depends on the heterogeneity of the whale's environment (exogeneous factors) and the whale's ability to perceive it (endogeneous factors). For the fin whale trajectory we calculated d = 1.03 +/−0.01 with the divider method. The aggregated distribution of available resources for the fin whale in the western Mediterranean Sea can explain this result close to 1. The heterogeneity of this food resources is not a `measured heterogeneity' but is a `functional heterogeneity'. The low fractal dimension also points to the low probability that the tagged fin whale and the zooplankton aggregates will meet in the western Mediterranean Sea so the fin whale must cover long straight lines from one patch of available zooplankton to another. },

  abstract={ There is increasing interest in large, infrequent, natural disturbances and how they affect ecosystems. Attributes of patches produced by some natural disturbances, such as blowdowns, have seldom been measured. We measured attributes of patches produced by a large blowdown (over 10&nbsp;000&nbsp;ha) in northern Colorado, USA in 1997. The blowdown produced 402, 655, or 756 patches, based on three different concepts of a blowdown patch. An inverse-J relationship shows that most patches are small in size (&lt;200 ha), while few are large. Most patches have a high percentage of blown-down trees (&gt;50% down). Blowdown patches are highly variable in their size, perimeter length, and distance to the nearest patch. The blowdown patches are larger and have more complex shapes than patches in the surrounding forest. Mean size of blowdown patches (25&nbsp;ha) may be smaller than those of crown fires in a nearby forest, but similar total areas may be affected. About 75% of the blowdown area is within 125&nbsp;m of a forest not blown down, so natural tree regeneration should not be a problem. About 16,400 ha of mature spruce-fir forest is susceptible to first-year attack by spruce beetles, as this forest is within the expected dispersal distance (1.2&nbsp;km) from blowdown patches where beetle reproduction is favored. Timber harvest patches differ from blowdown patches in size and distance to nearest patch. It also may be inappropriate to mimic forest blowdown patches using timber harvesting in this region, due to the rare occurrence of large blowdowns, their spatial restriction, and other factors. },

Western blotting disclosed that hamartin and tuberin are both abundant in the cerebral gray matter and that they have similar subcellular distributions and developmental patterns of expression. Immunohistochemical localizations of hamartin and tuberin were also similar, with high levels of expression being localized to the cerebral neurons and glial cells, renal uriniferous and collecting tubules, and cardiac muscles. In the cerebrum with TSC, both hamartin and tuberin were simultaneously reduced in the cortical tubers and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, and from the normal-appearing cortex. The renal angiomyolipomas and cardiac rhabdomyomas also showed a loss of both the proteins. These results provide evidence for the co-localization and interaction of hamartin and tuberin in vivo, and suggest that a mutation in one TSC gene may secondarily affect the expression of the other in some TSC lesions. },

It suppresses the accumulation of mutations in somatic cells and substantially decreases the probability of malignant diseases. The p53 gene acts highly selectively through multiple mechanisms. Under relatively favorable conditions, p53 helps to maintain intracellular homeostasis by balancing anabolic and catabolic processes and by timely elimination of reactive oxygen species. These functions of p53 facilitate maximal efficiency and survival of cells under conditions of physiological stresses. In the case of grave molecular damage caused by severe stress, a significant amount of highly active p53 is induced leading to irreversible growth arrest and programmed cell death. The induced functions of p53 secure the timely elimination from the organism of damaged and potentially dangerous cells. Collectively, the functions of p53 contribute to the prevention of malignant and other diseases and decelerate the aging process. },

Only the non-crystalline sample shows the normal mode relaxation together with the segmental (α-relaxation) and the Johari-Goldstein (β-relaxation) modes. The crystalline samples show also polarization contributions due to the existence of interfaces between the crystallites and the amorphous phase. The relaxation times of the (α and normal modes can be described by a VFT equation with the same value of T0. There is a slowing-down of the segmental mode due to the presence of crystallites. The temperature dependence of the α and β relaxations in the copolymers is very similar to that found in pure PPG, while there are significant differences in the case of the normal mode of the non-crystalline sample. The size of the cooperatively rearranging regions CRR, and the width of the glass transition region increase slightly with the degree of crystallinity. The temperature dependence of the size of CRRs is compatible with the prediction of fluctuation theory. No systematic effect of the degree of crystallinity on the β-relaxation has been found. Near T g the β-relaxation time is close to the primitive time of the coupling model. },

This paper examines the properties of lacunarity analysis and compares it with other methods of pattern analysis. Lacunarity analysis gives different results for complementary patterns, which may be an advantage depending on circumstances. The method, however, is not precise in determining the scale or the patch size in pattern with known properties. A modification that improves the interpretability of the results of the analysis is introduced but a weakness of this approach is that it does provide clear indications of the characteristics of cases that exhibit more than one scale of pattern. Because different methods react to different features in data, it is recommended that data be analysed by more than one method and the results compared for greater insight into their characteristics. },

  abstract={ The spatial integrity of a habitat or landscape is determined by the occurrence of habitat fragments and of perforations inside them. A landscape is said to have less spatial integrity with increasing numbers of fragments and perforations. The Euler number (ε) is a numerical measure of spatial integrity, based upon the difference |n f −n p | between the number of fragments (n f ) and the number of perforations (n p ). In this contribution, ε is evaluated, and an improvement is presented as a new index ε*, which is a combination of two metrics (ε i , ε d ) based on n f and n p . The term ε i quantifies the intensity of perforation and/or fragmentation. The term ε d measures the extent to which fragmentation predominates perforation, and vice versa. The intensity and dominance measures are combined into an Euclidean distance measure, generating the new ensemble value ε*, calculated as ε*= (n f +n p )−1√[1 +n f 2]. Use, sensitivity, and application of ε*, ε i , and ε d are illustrated using percolation maps. Application of the new metrics by environmental scientists is encouraged because (1) no negative values can be generated with ε*, ε i , and ε d ; (2) the range of ε*, ε i , and ε d is fixed; (3) process dominance and intensity are both assessed; (4) ε*, ε i , and ε d are easy to calculate and to interpret; and (5) ε* is not only based upon |n f −n p |, as ε is. Guidelines for practical use by means of a biplot of ε i and ε d are given. },

In thisstudy, we used long time series of fire perimeter data (fire atlases) and datafor topography, vegetation, and climate to evaluate relationships between large20thcentury fires and landscape characteristics in two contrastingareas: the 486,673-ha Gila/Aldo Leopold Wilderness Complex (GALWC)in New Mexico, USA, and the 785,090-ha Selway-BitterrootWilderness Complex (SBWC) in Idaho and Montana, USA. There were importantsimilarities and differences in gradients of topography, vegetation, andclimatefor areas with different fire frequencies, both within and between study areas.These unique and general relationships, when compared between study areas,highlight important characteristics of fire regimes in the Northern andSouthernRocky Mountains of the Western United States.Results suggest that amount and horizontal continuity of herbaceous fuels limitthe frequency and spread of surface fires in the GALWC, while the moisturestatus of large fuels and crown fuels limits the frequency of moderate-to-highseverity fires in the SBWC. These empirically described spatial and temporalrelationships between fire, landscape attributes, and climate increaseunderstanding of interactions among broad-scale ecosystem processes. Resultsalso provide a historical baseline for fire management planning over broadspatial and temporal scales in each wilderness complex. },

EBV was reactivated in the BLCLs Akata and Raji, and in a LCL OB-R33 cells after cross-linking surface immunoglobulin (sIg) with anti-Ig. After stimulation with anti-Ig, MAPK phosphorylation was strongly induced in all BLCLs and in a few LCLs, but not in other LCLs. MAPK was constitutively phosphorylated in most LCLs but not in BLCLs. Expression of EBNA2 and LMP1, and LMP2A was analyzed with both immunoblotting and RT-PCR. EBNA2 and LMP1 were expressed in most LCLs and in some BLCLs. LMP2A was expressed in all BLCLs and LCLs except Namalwa cells. To test the hypothesis that LMP1 induces constitutive MAPK phosphorylation, the LMP1 expression vector was transfected into Akata cells. MAPK phosphorylation was not induced in such transfected cells. Our results indicate that BLCLs and LCLs respectively have distinct MAPK phosphorylation patterns, and that induction of MAPK phosphorylation correlates with EBV reactivation in a few cell lines but not in most of the tested cell lines. },

The goal of thisstudy was to molecularly characterize thisnatural hybridization event, investigate themode of hybridization, and determine the malefertility of the hybrid individuals. Bothmorphological and RAPD marker data indicatethat the putative hybrid individuals are theprogeny of R. rosifolius and R.hawaiensis. All 39 hybrid individuals sampledhad the chloroplast DNA haplotype of R.rosifolius. Thus hybridization appears to beasymmetric, with R. rosifolius acting asthe maternal parent. All hybrid individualsassessed for pollen stainability were sterile,and there was no evidence of backcrossing toeither parent. This result suggests thathybrids are of the first filial generation andthat variation among hybrids reflectsdifferences within the parental populations.Sympatric populations of R. hawaiensisand R. rosifolius occur on four islandsand six additional alien species of Rubusare naturalized and sympatric with R. hawaiensisin Hawai`i. Further investigationis merited to assess whether hybridization maypose a threat to the long term viability ofR. hawaiensis.

Method: Twenty females hospitalized with AN completed intake and discharge assessments of BMI, depression and eating disorder severity, as well as personality pathology with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R). Clinical outcome for a subset of patients at 1-year post-hospitalization was determined. Results: The only factor that predicted better versus worse outcome at 1-year post-hospitalization was change in Low Self-Esteem (LSE) from the MMPI-2. Improved LSE from admission to discharge predicted remission at 1-year post-hospitalization, while worsening LSE predicted relapse. Regardless of outcome, NEO PI-R Neuroticism remained pathologically elevated in AN patients during hospitalization. Discussion: Pathological levels of neuroticism may represent a vulnerability factor for AN. In contrast, self-esteem appears to be a modifiable factor that predicts outcome following hospitalization, and may be an important target for treatment. },

  abstract={ Despite the widespread need to predict and assess the effects of landscape change on biodiversity, the array of tools available for this purpose is still limited. Species’ patterns and human activities such as land use respond to the environment on their own suite of scales in space and time so that their interactions are overlapping but complex. It is difficult, therefore, to relate biodiversity to patterns described solely by metric assessments of spatial heterogeneity. In this methodological paper, we therefore propose consideration of two measures of landscape organisation which focus on the relationships between different properties of the landscape system (e.g., soil type distribution, land use distribution), rather than on their description alone. Alpha organisation measures the degree to which the distribution of features such as land use deviate from a random distribution, measured here as fractal dimension from the semivariogram of a variable describing agricultural intensity. Beta organisation measures the degree of deviation by which the spatial distribution of one property (e.g., human land use) is independent of the distribution of another (e.g., soil type) and was derived from relative mutual information (= redundancy) between the ‘agricultural land use’ and ‘soil types’. These measures are illustrated in a rural landscape of the lower Seine valley, at two scales of observation, and at two dates (1963 and 1999) separated by substantial agricultural change due the European Common Agricultural Policy (= CAP). The results show that analysis of patterns of agricultural activity across a range of spatial scales (α organisation), or across the pattern of spatial variation in soil types (β organisation) reveal how the agricultural actors respond to environmental constraints at different scales. This organisation concept relates to the metastability of landscape systems, and suggest possible correlation between high values of landscape organisation and high levels in biodiversity. },

  abstract={ Genetic engineering of forest tree species is regarded as a strategy to reduce worldwide pressure on natural forests, to conserve genetic resources and ameliorate stress on global climate, and to meet growing demand for forest wood and timber products. Genetic engineering approaches toward the control or management of fungal pathogens, arthropod herbivores, bacterial and viral diseases, the use of pest resistance genes, and weed competitors are being studied. Although the production of transgenic trees is relatively recent and only a few species have been successfully genetically engineered in forest tree species, very useful and valuable information is available on the application of transgenic trees. Genes involved in important agricultural traits such as herbicide resistance, insect resistance, and wood quality have been isolated and have been used to genetically engineer trees. New technologies of plant molecular biology and genomics now make it possible high-efficient genetic improvement of forest trees. Genetic engineering promises to expand greatly the potential for genetic manipulation as new genes of commercial interest are discovered and utilized. Lignification is a process essential to the nature and evolution of vascular plants that is still poorly understood, even though it has been studied for more than a century. Recent studies on mutant and transgenic plants indicate that lignification may be far more flexible than previously realized. Rines with a mutation affecting the biosynthesis of the major lignin precursor, coniferyl alcohol, show a high level of an unusual subunit, dihydroconiferyl alcohol. It is also unusual as a plant polymer in that there are no plant enzymes for its degradation. These results have significant implications regarding the tradiational definition of lignin, and highlight the need for a better understanding of the lignin precursor biosynthetic pathway. In this review, we describe the progress made recently in genetic engineering of forest tree species. },

  abstract={  Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) plants are widely known for their contribution to the global and regional environment because of their ability to fix CO2. On the other hand, some scientists have doubts about CO2 fixation by kenaf and have misgivings about the effect of kenaf on the ecosystem. We have characterized the structural characteristics of cell walls of bast fibers, cores, roots, and leaves of kenaf during the maturation of plants and investigated the rate of photosynthesis. During maturation of the kenaf plant the cellulose (bast fiber 52–59%, core 44–46%) and lignin (bast fiber 9.3–13.2%, core 18.3–23.2%) contents increased significantly. The aromatic composition of the lignin of bast fiber was significantly different from that of the core lignin and of other plants. The lignin of bast fiber appears similar to pure syringyl lignin. Fixation of CO2 by kenaf plants and their contribution to the global environment are discussed. A significatly high rate of photosynthesis of kenaf plants was observed compared to that of woody plants in Japan, but the amount of CO2 fixation depends on the characteristics of the plantation. If the kenaf was planted in high density, about twice as much CO2 was fixed as was fixed by trees in a tropical rain forest. },

The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a shortenedfallow period on the Bragantina landscape dynamics and equilibrium. Dynamicswere characterized by landscape structural changes, particularly in the spatialdistribution of secondary forests, and by transition matrix. Equilibrium wasdefined by temporal and spatial parameters, and by the increment ofagriculturalareas from 1985 to 1996, analyzed with 6 LANDSAT-TM images. I worked with 6areas of 250 ha each, 3 with short fallow periods (2–4years)and 3 with long fallow periods (about 10 years). Results showed that shortfallow period areas did not present an equilibrium situation. In these areas,developed secondary vegetation tended to disappear and agricultural areas werebeing expanded at an average rate of 3% per year. Landscape structure changespointed out that a reduction in fallow period was occurring in already shortfallow period areas. Long fallow period areas presented a shifting mosaicsteady-state condition, where punctual changes due to agricultural uses werecompensated by field abandonment rate. Both agricultural uses and fieldabandonment rates were lower in long fallow period areas when compared withshort ones. Comparisons with indigenous traditional cropping-fallow cyclesindicate that sustainable conditions could be maintained with 11 years offallowfor each cropping year, while shorter cycles would break down the system ifagricultural improvements are not implemented. },

Best known among the latter is the sunflower. Bowl shaped flowers comparable to satellite disks focus the solar radiation effectively on their centre, resulting in a warming of the female organs at that point. Temperature differences above ambient can be as high as 10.7 K with a mean value of 6.0 K.

Three QTLs for relative root length (RRL) were detected on chromosome 1, 9, 12, respectively, and 1 QTL for root length under Al stress is identical on chromosome 1 after one week and two weeks stress. Comparison of QTLs on chromosome 1 from different studies indicated an identical interval between C86 and RZ801 with gene(s) for Al tolerance. This interval provides an important start point for isolating genes responsible for Al tolerance and understanding the genetic nature of Al tolerance in rice. Four Al induced ESTs located in this interval were screened by reverse Northern analysis and confirmed by Northern analysis. They would be candidate genes for the QTL. },

  abstract={ In southwestern North America, large-scale climate patterns appear to exert control on moisture availability, fire occurrence, and tree demography, raising the compelling possibility of regional synchronization of forest dynamics. Such regional signals may be obscured, however, by local, site-specific factors, such as disturbance history and land use. Contiguous sites with similar physical environments, lower and middle Rhyolite Canyon, Arizona, USA, shared nearly the same fire history from 1660-1801, but then diverged. For the next 50 years, fires continued to occur frequently in lower Rhyolite, but, probably as result of flood-induced debris deposition, largely ceased in middle Rhyolite. We related stand dynamics of Arizona pine (Pinus arizonica) to fire history and drought severity and compared the dynamics in the two sites before and after the divergence in fire frequency. Fires occurred during unusually dry years, and possibly following unusually moist years. Arizona pine exhibited three age structure peaks: two (1810–1830 and 1870–1900) shared by the two sites and one (1610–1640) only in middle Rhyolite. The latter two peaks occurred during periods of unusually low fire frequency, suggesting that fire-induced mortality shapes age structure. Evidence was mixed for the role of favorable moisture availability in age structure. As expected, moisture availability had a prominent positive effect on radial growth, but the effect of fire was largely neutral. The two sites differed only moderately in stand dynamics during the period of divergence, exhibiting subtle age structure contrasts and, in middle Rhyolite only, reduced growth during a 50-year fire hiatus followed by fire-induced release. These results suggest that, despite local differences in disturbance history, forest responses to regional fire and climate processes can persist. },

From the very beginning, in 1993, the microbial activity was the main bioindicator selected to analyse the ‘soil health state’. For this reason, a microcalorimetric technique was used lately to analyse the influence of different human activities such as reforestations, agricultural exploitation or pollution on the microbial activity in different soils. Microcalorimetry is the main scientific technique used in this research to follow the stimulation of the microbial activity by addition of glucose. The data obtained were complemented by a study of physical, chemical and biological parameters of soil and allowed to follow the microbial activity in soils of Galicia (Spain) along the year. The final results, still in revision, will be helpful in establishing a data basis for real maps of the ‘health state’ of different soils. Such maps could be used to design processes that help us to decide how we should exploit soils ensuring their sustainability. },

  abstract={ Kanamycin and geneticin are commonly used for the selection of neomycin phosphotransferase II (npt II) transformed plants. Since papaya tissue is sensitive to both antibiotics, it is difficult to explore their effects on the regeneration process solely based on using non-transformed tissues. Adventitious roots derived from npt II-transgenic and non-transgenic papaya shoots in vitro were used as explants in this investigation. The effects of kanamycin and geneticin on callus formation, embryogenesis, and conversion of somatic embryos to shoots were compared. Callus growth derived from npt II-transformed root explants was apparently enhanced on kanmycin within 50–200 mg l−1 or on geneticin within 12.5–50 mg l−1 as compared to those on antibiotic-free controls. The percentages of npt II-transformed somatic embryo-forming callus were not significantly different (16.3–18.3%) on geneticin less than 6.25 mg l−1 and only slightly reduced (11.2–15.7%) on geneticin within 12.5–50 mg l−1, whereas, formation of somatic embryos was strongly suppressed on kanamycin media. Conversion rates of npt II-transformed somatic embryos to shoots were not significantly different among all kanamycin or geneticin treatments. Percentages of the callus derived from non-transformed root explants were greatly reduced on the medium containing more than 25 mg l−1 kanamycin or geneticin, and no somatic embryos formed from untransformed callus on any kanamycin or geneticin media. Our results indicated that somatic embryogenesis of callus derived from npt II-transformed root explants of papaya was strongly inhibited by kanamycin. Thus, to regenerate npt II-transformed cells from papaya root tissue, we recommend using the lower concentration geneticin (12.5–25 mg l−1) to avoid the adverse effects of kanamycin on embryogenesis. },

Under light microscope, blue crystals were seen inside the embryogenic and suspensor cells, and also completely blue somatic embryos were obtained. The uidA gene was also detected by PCR analysis in genomic DNA isolated from transformed embryogenic tissues.

  abstract={ Concentrations of norditerpenoid alkaloids vary among larkspur (Delphinium) species, locations, and years, but environmental stresses seem to have little effect on alkaloid levels. There is a need for a functional hypothesis of alkaloid synthesis and metabolism to explain the observed trends in concentration and to predict the toxicity of larkspur populations. This study was replicated at two locations over two years in the mountains of central Utah. Ten tall larkspur (D. barbeyi) plants were marked at each location, and a single stalk was harvested from each plant at weekly intervals throughout the growing season. Concentrations of toxic and total alkaloids were measured by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and alkaloid pools were calculated by multiplying the alkaloid concentration by the dry weight of the plant to determine the amount of alkaloids in the stalk. Alkaloid pools in the stalks increased for the first three weeks, leveled off, and then declined to low levels as the plants began to senesce. Concentrations of alkaloids declined through the season, as the alkaloids were diluted in the increasing biomass as the plants grew. These patterns will be used to predict potential toxicity of larkspur populations. },

For the southside economic region of Virginia, we generated a surface (map) of urbanization pressure by interpolation of population from a ring of cities surrounding the region. The interpolated map showed a geographic gradient of urbanization pressure or demand for land that increased from northwest to southeast. Estimates of forest fragmentation were moderately correlated with the geographic gradient of urbanization pressure. The fragmentation-urbanization relationship was corroborated by examining land-cover change against the urbanization map. The geographic gradient in land-cover change was strongly correlated with the urbanization pressure gradient. The correspondence between geographic gradients in land-cover change and urbanization pressure suggests that forest fragmentation will occur at a greater rate in the eastern portion of the southside economic region in the future. },

  abstract={ Spatially-distributed estimates of biologically-driven CO2 flux are of interest in relation to understanding the global carbon cycle. Global coverage by satellite sensors offers an opportunity to assess terrestrial carbon (C) flux using a variety of approaches and corresponding spatial resolutions. An important consideration in evaluating the approaches concerns the scale of the spatial heterogeneity in land cover over the domain being studied. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, forests are highly fragmented with respect to stand age class and hence C flux. In this study, the effects of spatial resolution on estimates of total annual net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) for a 96&nbsp;km2 area in the central Cascades Mountains of western Oregon were examined. The scaling approach was a simple `measure and multiply' algorithm. At the highest spatial resolution (25&nbsp;m), a stand age map derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery provided the area for each of six forest age classes. The products of area for each age class and its respective NPP or NEP were summed for the area wide estimates. In order to evaluate potential errors at coarser resolutions, the stand age map was resampled to grain sizes of 100, 250, 500 and 1000&nbsp;m using a majority filter reclassification. Local variance in near-infrared (NIR) band digital number at successively coarser grain sizes was also examined to characterize the scale of the heterogeneity in the scene. For this managed forest landscape, proportional estimation error in land cover classification at the coarsest resolution varied from −1.0 to +0.6 depending on the initial representation and the spatial distribution of the age class. The overall accuracy of the 1000&nbsp;m resolution map was 42% with respect to the 25&nbsp;m map. Analysis of local variance in NIR digital number suggested a patch size on the order of 100–500&nbsp;m on a side. Total estimated NPP was 12% lower and total estimated NEP was 4% lower at 1000&nbsp;m compared to 25&nbsp;m. Carbon flux estimates based on quantifying differences in total biomass stored on the landscape at two points in time might be affected more strongly by a coarse resolution analysis because the differences among classes in biomass are more extreme than the differences in C flux and because the additional steps in the flux algorithm would contribute to error propagation. Scaling exercises involving reclassification of fine scale imagery over a range of grain sizes may be a useful screening tool for stratifying regions of the terrestrial surface relative to optimizing the spatial resolution for C flux estimation purposes. },

  abstract={ In order to investigate the implication of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in T signalling, we assessed their effects on the activation of two mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, i.e. extracellularly-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) in Jurkat T-cells. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) alone failed to induce MAP kinase (MAPK) enzyme activity. To elucidate whether DHA and EPA act via protein kinase C (PKC) dependent and independent pathways, we employed their respective activators, i.e. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and antiCD3 antibodies. We observed that U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase-ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), abolished the actions of these two agents on MAPK activation, suggesting that they act upstream of MEK1/2. Further EPA and DHA diminished both the PMA- and antiCD3 antibodies-induced enzyme activity of ERK1/ERK2 in Jurkat T-cells. Interestingly, okadaic acid (OA), a phosphatase inhibitor seems to act downstream of MEK1/2 as U0126 failed to inhibit the OA-induced MAPK activation. It is noteworthy that EPA and DHA not only failed to curtail the OA-induced MAPK activity but also these n-3 PUFAs at 20 μM potentiated the action of OA. Therefore, EPA and DHA seem to modulate MAPK activation upstream and downstream of MEK1/2. On the hand, arachidonic acid, an n-6 PUFA potentiated the MAPK enzyme activity. In conclusion, our study shows that EPA and DHA may regulate T-cells functions by modulating MAPK enzyme activity. },

  abstract={ Much has been written about the chinampas of central Mexico. One of the commonly repeated themes is that these wetland fields were self-irrigated from below in a process known as sub-irrigation. According to this model, water infiltrates the planting platforms from adjacent canals and then rises to the root zone by capillary action. Thus, chinampas are thought to have needed little supplemental irrigation, and produced dependable and high yields. Here I report the results of field and lab studies of soils of 10 chinampas in the region east of Xochimilco, in the Mexican Federal District. These interpretations are combined with discussion of maize rooting tendencies, regional rainfall patterns, and the presence of willow tree roots in chinampa soils. I also consider whether farmers strive to create and maintain optimum field morphologies for subirrigation when faced with both flood and drought risk, and when manual irrigation is aready option. I conclude that while sub-irrigation is possible under certain combinations of field morphology, crop type, and soil properties, it was a relatively minor factor in the overall decision-making process of past chinampa farmers, and should not be a major determinant of future planning for chinampa preservation or reconstruction. Furthermore, sub-irrigation must be modeled carefully in relation to soil properties, croptypes, and seasonality if it is to beconsidered a significant function of wetland fields in any context. },

  abstract={ The US Army Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC) uses a modified form of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate spatially explicit rates of soil erosion by water across military training facilities. One modification involves the RUSLE support practice factor (P factor), which is used to account for the effect of disturbance by human activities on erosion rates. Since disturbance from off-road military vehicular traffic moving through complex landscapes varies spatially, a spatially explicit nonlinear regression model (disturbance model) is used to predict the distribution of P factor values across a training facility. This research analyzes the uncertainty in this model's disturbance predictions for the Fort Hood training facility in order to determine both the spatial distribution of prediction uncertainty and the contribution of different error sources to that uncertainty. This analysis shows that a three-category vegetation map used by the disturbance model was the greatest source of prediction uncertainty, especially for the map categories shrub and tree. In areas mapped as grass, modeling error (uncertainty associated with the model parameter estimates) was the largest uncertainty source. These results indicate that the use of a high-quality vegetation map that is periodically updated to reflect current vegetation distributions, would produce the greatest reductions in disturbance prediction uncertainty. },

Antifeedant effects of the test compounds were structure- and species-dependent. The most active antifeedants to L. decemlineata were 1,14-diacetylcardiopetaline (9) and 18-hydroxy-14-O-methylgadesine (33), followed by 8-O-methylconsolarine (12), 14-O-acetyldelectinine (27), karakoline (7), cardiopetaline (8), 18-O-demethylpubescenine (13), 14-O-acetyldeltatsine (18), takaosamine (21), ajadine (24), and 8-O-methylcolumbianine (6) (EC50 &lt;1 μg/cm2). This insect showed a moderate response to atropine. S. littoralis had the strongest antifeedant response to 24, 18, 14-O-acetyldelcosine (19), and delphatine (29) (EC50 &lt;3 μg/cm2). None of the model substances affected the feeding behavior of this insect. The most toxic compound to L. decemlineata was aconitine (1), followed by cardiopetalidine (10) (% mortality &gt;60), 14-deacetylpubescenine (14), 18-O-benzoyl-18-O-demethyl-14-O-deacetylpubescenine (17), 14-O- acetyldelcosine (19), 14-deacetylajadine (25) and methyllycaconitine (30) (% mortality &gt;45). Orally injected S. littoralis larvae were negatively affected by 1, cardiopetaline (8), 10, 1,14-O-acetylcardiopetalidina (11), 12, 14, 1,18-O-diacetyl-19-oxo-gigactonine (41), olivimine (43), and eserine in varying degrees. Their antifeedant or insecticidal potencies did not parallel their reported nAChR binding activity, but did correlate with the agonist/antagonist insecticidal/antifeedant model proposed for nicotininc insecticides. A few compounds [14, tuguaconitine (38), 14-demethyldelboxine (40), 19, dehydrodelsoline (36), 18-O-demethylpubescenine (13), 41, 9, and delcosine (23)] had selective cytotoxic effects to ward insect-derived Sf9 cells. None were cytotoxic to mammalian CHO cells and none increased Trypanosoma cruzi mortality. The selective cytotoxic effects of some structures indicate that they can act on biological targets other than neuroreceptors. },

In a freshwater tidal wetland along the James River in Virginia, USA, redox potential, pH, water-table level, and soil temperature were monitored continuously at two depths (20 and 50 cm) at three sites during a 12-month period from September 1, 1997 to August 31, 1998. Redox potentials were at or below − 150 mV (methanogenic or sulfate reducing conditions) at the 50-cm depth during the entire monitoring period. At the 20-cm depth, redox potentials remained highly reducing 95% of the time. The soil is continuously wet throughout the year, with the water-table level above the 20-cm soil depth for 95% of the time. Water-table level or hydrology was the primary factor controlling fluctuations in the redox state. Soil pH values were generally between 6 and 8, and they dropped 1 pH unit upon an oxidation event, which was reversible. Soil temperature at the 50-cm depth never dropped below 5° C, indicating a year-round biological activity season. This wetland supports a large diversity of plant species. Permanently reduced sub-surfaces, year-round biological activity, and large organic matter accumulations are characteristic features of this freshwater tidal wetland. },

The telomerization of RnMa or RnMaAm in the presence of alkanethiol as a chain transfer agent gave telomer-type anionic surfactants (xRnMa, xRnMaAm; x is total average number of alkyl chains; x=2.8–3.3) having multialkyl chains and multicarboxylate groups. Their surface-active properties were investigated by several techniques such as surface tension, foaming property, and emulsification power measurements. Critical micelle concentrations (CMC) of xRnMa were 1/110–1/14 of those of RnMa with the same alkyl chain length. xRnMa and xRnMaAm gave higher efficiencies in lowering the surface tension than RnMa and RnMaAm in aqueous solutions. In particular, the surface tension of 3.2R12MaAm was 24.4 mN m−1 at the CMC. Foaming abilities and foam stabilities of xRnMa and xRnMaAm were higher than those of RnMa and RnMaAm. The addition of 300 ppm of Ca2+ to the aqueous solutions rendered the telomers less surface active. Shaking the aqueous solutions of telomers with toluene emulsified them. The highly stable oil-in-water type emulsion was formed by using 3.0R10MaAm and 3.2R12MaAm, and the degree of emulsification was kept at a level of about 80% after 60 min of standing. Thus, telomer-type surfactants showed excellent surface activities that were superior to the corresponding monomers as well as to conventional surfactants. The relationship between alkyl chain length of the telomers and the properties of surface tension, foaming, and emulsification was unclear. },

  abstract={ Size of a forest patch is a useful predictor of density and reproductive success of Neotropical migratory birds in much of eastern North America. Within these forested landscapes, large forest tracts appear to be sources – fragments in which surpluses of offspring are produced and can potentially colonize new fragments including woodlot sinks where reproduction fails to balance adult mortality. Within agricultural landscapes of the midwestern U.S., where forests are severely fragmented, high levels of brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and intense predation on nests generally result in low reproductive success for Neotropical migrants regardless of forest size. In some midwestern U.S. landscapes, however, the variation in reproductive success among forest fragments suggests that `source' habitat could still exist for Neotropical migrants. We used vegetation, fragment and landscape metrics to develop multivariate models that attempt to explain the variation in abundance and reproductive success of Neotropical migrants nesting in an agricultural landscape in northern Indiana, USA. We produced models that reasonably described the pattern of species richness of Neotropical migrants and the abundance of wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) and several other Neotropical migrant species within 14 forest fragments. In contrast, we were unable to produce useful models of the reproductive success of wood thrushes breeding in the same forest fragments. Our results suggest that (1) abundance patterns of Neotropical migrants are probably influenced by both landscape- and fragment-scale factors; (2) multivariate analyses of Neotropical migrant abundance are not useful in modeling the corresponding patterns of reproductive success; and (3) the location of any remaining `source' habitat for Neotropical migrants breeding within agricultural landscapes in North America will be difficult to predict with indirect measures such as vegetation composition or landscape context. As a result, the potential for developing conservation strategies for Neotropical migrants will be limited without labor-intensive, direct measurements of demographic parameters. },

The reported prevalence of chronic SCI pain is variable but averages 65% with around one third of these people rating their pain as severe. The mechanisms responsible for the presence of pain are poorly understood. However, evidence from clinical observations and the use of animal models of SCI pain suggests that a number of processes may be important. These include functional and structural plastic changes in the central nervous system following injury, with changes in receptor function and loss of normal inhibition resulting in an increased neuronal excitability. A number of specific types of SCI pain can be distinguished based on descriptors, location and response to treatment. Nociceptive pain can arise from musculoskeletal structures and viscera and neuropathic pain can arise from spinal cord and nerve damage. The role of psychological and environmental factors also needs to be considered. Accurate identification of these pain types will help in selecting appropriate treatment approaches. Current treatments employ a variety of pharmacological, surgical, physical and psychological approaches. However, evidence for many of the treatments in use is still limited. It is hoped that future research will identify effective treatment strategies that accurately target specific mechanisms. Spinal Cord (2001) 39, 63–73. },

As an initial genetic characterization of early embryo development in P. radiata, a cDNA library was constructed using mRNA from cultured tissue that was forming stage 1 embryos. This library was differentially screened against non-embryogenic tissues (roots, shoots and needles) and six gene families preferentially expressed during conifer embryogenesis were identified. These genes showed high mRNA transcript levels in embryogenic tissue and little or no expression in non-embryogenic (roots, shoots and needles) or callus tissue (needle and fibre culture callus). These gene families included four putative extracellular proteins (germin, β-expansin, 21 kDa protein precursor and cellulase), a cytochrome P450 enzyme and a gene with unknown function (PRE87).

  abstract={ The effect of confinement in the segmental relaxation of polymers is considered. On the basis of a thermodynamic model we discuss the emerging relevance of the fast degrees of freedom in stimulating the much slower segmental relaxation, as an effect of the constraints at the walls of the amorphous regions. In the case that confinement is due to the presence of crystalline domains, a quasi-Poissonian distribution of local constraining conditions is derived as a result of thermodynamic equilibrium. This implies that the average free-energy barrier $ \Delta$ F for conformational rearrangement is of the same order of the dispersion of the barrier heights, $ \delta$ ( $ \Delta$ F) , around $ \Delta$ F . As an example, we apply the results to the analysis of the $ \alpha$ -relaxation as observed by dielectric broad-band spectroscopy in semicrystalline poly(ethylene terephthalate) cold-crystallized from either an isotropic or an oriented glass. It is found that in the latter case the regions of cooperative rearrangement are significantly larger than in the former. },

  abstract={ As in many ecosystems, carbon (C) cycling in arctic and boreal regions is tightly linked to the cycling of nutrients: nutrients (particularly nitrogen) are mineralized through the process of organic matter decomposition (C mineralization), and nutrient availability strongly constrains ecosystem C gain through primary production. This link between C and nutrient cycles has implications for how northern systems will respond to future climate warming and whether feedbacks to rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 from these regions will be positive or negative. Warming is expected to cause a substantial release of C to the atmosphere because of increased decomposition of the large amounts of organic C present in high-latitude soils (a positive feedback to climate warming). However, increased nutrient mineralization associated with this decomposition is expected to stimulate primary production and ecosystem C gain, offsetting or even exceeding C lost through decomposition (a negative feedback to climate warming). Increased primary production with warming is consistent with results of numerous experiments showing increased plant growth with nutrient enrichment. Here we examine key assumptions behind this scenario: (1) temperature is a primary control of decomposition in northern regions, (2) increased decomposition and associated nutrient release are tightly coupled to plant nutrient uptake, and (3) short-term manipulations of temperature and nutrient availability accurately predict long-term responses to climate change. },

  abstract={ This paper uses a cellular automata simulation model of a hypothetical landscape to investigate the role of location as it relates to the efficacy of land retirement in achieving two environmental goals: hydrological improvement and habitat improvement. Statistical analysis of simulation results is used to show how absolute and relative location relate to achievement of these objectives. Linear and nonlinear compromise programming frameworks then combine these two environmental objectives and a cost minimization objective into a measure that allows decision-makers to rank the desirability of different retirement strategies. These frameworks are explored to determine what each implies about the tradeoffs that must be made among objectives and among the spatial land parcel characteristics that contribute to those objectives. },

  abstract={ Detection of discontinuities in landscape patterns is a crucial problem both in ecology and in environmental sciences since they may indicate substantial scale changes in generating and maintaining processes of landscape patches. This paper presents a statistical procedure for detecting distinct scales of pattern for irregular patch mosaics using fractal analysis. The method suggested is based on a piecewise regression model given by fitting different regression lines to different ranges of patches ordered according to patch size (area). Proper shift-points, where discontinuities occur, are then identified by means of an iterative procedure. Further statistical tests are applied in order to verify the statistical significance of the best models selected. Compared to the method proposed by Krummel et al. (1987), the procedure described here is not influenced by subjective choices of initial parameters. The procedure was applied to landscape pattern analysis of irregular patch mosaics (CORINE biotopes) of a watershed within the Map of the Italian Nature Project. Results for three different CORINE patch types are herein presented revealing different scaling properties with special pattern organizations linked to ecological traits of vegetation communities and human disturbance. },

  abstract={ This paper presents a statistical method for detecting distinct scales of pattern for mosaics of irregular patches, by means of perimeter–area relationships. Krummel et al. (1987) were the first to develop a method for detecting different scaling domains in a landscape of irregular patches, but this method requires investigator judgment and is not completely satisfying. Grossi et al. (2001) suggested a modification of Krummel's method in order to detect objectively the change points between different scaling domains. Their procedure is based on the selection of the best piecewise linear regression model using a set of statistical tests. Even though the change points were estimated, the null distributions used for testing purposes were those appropriate for known change points. The present paper investigates the effect that estimating the change points has on the underlying distribution theory. The procedure we suggest is based on the selection of the best piecewise linear regression model using a likelihood ratio (LR) test. Each segment of the piecewise linear model corresponds to a fractal domain. Breakpoints between different segments are unknown, so the piecewise linear models are non-linear. In this case, the frequency distribution of the LR statistic cannot be approximated by a chi-squared distribution. Instead, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain an empirical null distribution of the LR statistic. The suggested method is applied to three patch types (CORINE biotopes) located in the Val Baganza watershed of Italy. },

  abstract={ This paper examines some of the many problems and issues associated with integrating new and developing technologies into the education of future designers. As technology in general races ahead challenges arise for both commercial designers and educators on how best to keep track and utilise the advances. The challenge is particularly acute within tertiary education where the introduction of new cutting edge technology is often encouraged. Although this is generally achieved through the feedback of research activity, integrating new concepts at an appropriate level is a major task. Of particular concern is how focussed areas of applied technology can be made part of the multidisciplinary scope of design education. The paper describes the model used to introduce areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to undergraduate industrial design students. The successful interaction of research and education within a UK higher education establishment are discussed and project examples given. It is shown that, through selective tuition of research topics and appropriate technical support, innovative design solutions can result. In addition, it shows that by introducing leading edge and, in some cases, underdeveloped technology, specific key skills of independent learning, communication and research methods can be encouraged. },

Gaps had significantly less exchangeable base cations (K, Ca, and Mg) compared to forest plots in the upper mineral soil (0–25&nbsp;cm). Gaps also had significantly more dissolved organic N and extractable nitrate at depth (25–50&nbsp;cm), indicating increased nutrient leaching in gaps. In-situ N mineralization was significantly greater in gaps and edge plots compared to forest plots. We found significantly greater potential N mineralization (measured in the laboratory at 25°C and 40% water holding capacity) in forest compared to gap plots. Microbial biomass N was significantly greater (ca. two-fold) in the gap edge compared to both gaps and closed forest. Using principal component analyses we found that edge plots were positively correlated with all principal components, indicating increased in-situ and potential N mineralization, microbial biomass N, soil NO 3 − and NH 4 + , and soil organic matter. The gap edge may be a region of optimal microclimate and substrate to enhance microbial biomass and activity within these forest ecosystems. },

  abstract={ Xanthan samples prepared in different denaturation and renaturation conditions were studied by circular dichroism (CD) and size exclusion chromatography equipped with a multi-angle light scattering on-line detector (SEC-MALS). It turned out from CD that xanthan looses the double helical conformation in pure water at 80 °C and almost recovers locally the native conformation in the renaturation. On the other hand, SEC-MALS results indicated that the xanthan double helix dissociates into two single chains in the denaturation concentration cd ≤ 1 mg/cm3, but not at cd = 10 mg/cm3 due to the increase in the ionic strength by xanthan itself, stabilizing the xanthan dimer. Furthermore the xanthan single chain dissociated at cd ≤ 1 mg/cm3 reconstructs the intramolecular double helical structure with a hairpin loop in the renaturation, while the xanthan dimer denatured at cd = 10 mg/cm3 aggregates by mismatched pairing. The degree of aggregation is enhanced at higher added salt concentration at the renaturation. },

When the crystalline hPNB block was the major component in hPNB-b-hPMTF, the crystallization temperature of hPNB blocks at the maximum rate Tc* (i.e., the peak temperature of DSC exotherms during cooling at −5 °C/min) was found to be nearly the same to the glass transition temperature Tg of amorphous hPMTF blocks. For these copolymers, the excess upturn scattering at low angles was transiently observed during the melting of hPNB blocks, which depended significantly on the composition and the thermal history applied to hPNB-b-hPMTF before heating. The crystallized lamellar morphology (i.e., an alternating structure consisting of hPNB lamellar crystals and amorphous hPNB + hPMTF layers), which had been gradually transformed from the molten microdomain structure by the crystallization of hPNB blocks, was responsible for the emergence of this scattering, because the excess X-ray intensity was proportional to the volume fraction of the crystallized lamellar morphology existing in the system. We discussed the possible origin of this excess scattering by considering the morphological change during melting. },

His impact stretches across diverse areas ranging from gas injection and flash smelting in nonferrous pyrometallurgy, on the one hand, to the continuous casting of steel, microstructural engineering, and rotary kilns on the other. Among his formidable research accomplishments, his contribution to steel processing stands out. It was an area which challenged him and from which he gained enormous intellectual satisfaction. In this article, Dr. Brimacombe’s remarkable contributions to steel research are reviewed to reveal his ingenuity and innovation, which were hallmarks of his efforts. These qualities had a profound impact, not only on the quality of his research discoveries, but also on the people he mentored, the discipline of materials process engineering he fostered, and on institutions spanning universities, industry, professional societies, and government. How did he accomplish so much in such a short time? What can we learn from his example? We learn that it is not time, but creativity and dedication to the goal, that matters. We learn while Dr. Brimacombe possessed remarkable creative genius, it can be taught and fostered in individuals in our universities, in industry, and in society. We learn that breaking down barriers between artificial disciplinary boundaries, between institutions, and, most importantly, between people is critical in fostering ingenuity and innovation. We learn that enhancing communication through discourse and debate, recognizing and rewarding excellence, and creating the right culture in an organization is paramount. Above all, we learn that people are our most valuable resource. The importance of these lessons for universities, industry, and professional societies, at this time of immense technological and social transformation, will be explored in this article.

Soil disturbances resulting from land use changes were shown to modify the turnover of C and the formation of soil organic matter. A native semiarid shrub-steppe ecosystem recently converted into an irrigated agricultural development in the Columbia Basin of Washington State was evaluated for several abiotic indicators that might signal changes in an ecosystem during the initial stages of conversion and disturbance. Soil samples were collected in March of 2003 and 2004 from nine sites that included native shrub-steppe and agricultural fields converted in 2001 and 2002. Disturbance from conversion to irrigated crop production influenced total organic C and nitrogen (N) storage, C and N mineralization, and C turnover. Cultivated fields had greater concentrations of total organic C and N and higher cumulative C and N mineralization than native sites after 3&nbsp;years of cultivation. Soil organic C was divided into three pools: an active pool (C a) consisting of labile C (simple sugars, organic acids, the microbial biomass, and metabolic compounds of incorporated plant residues) with a mean residence time of days, an intermediate or slow pool (C s) consisting of structural plant residues and physically stabilized C, and a resistant fraction (C r) consisting of lignin and chemically stabilized C. Extended laboratory incubations of soil with measurements of CO2 were used to differentiate the size and turnover of the C a and C s functional C pools. The active pools were determined to be 4.5 and 6.5% and slow pools averaged 44 and 47% of the total C in native and cultivated fields, respectively. Cultivation, crop residue incorporation, and dairy manure compost amendments contributed to the increase in total soil C. },

We illustrate this approach by comparing burn patterns produced by a relatively simple fire spread algorithm with those generated by a more detailed fire behavior model from which the simpler algorithm was derived. Equivalence testing allows objective comparisons of the output of simple and complex models, to determine if the results are significantly similar. Neutral landscape models represent a range of landscape conditions that the model may encounter, allowing evaluation of the sensitivity and behavior of the model to different landscape compositions and configurations. We first tested the model for universal applicability, then narrowed the testing to assess the practical domain of applicability. As a whole, the calibrated simple model passed the test for significant equivalence using the 25% threshold. When applied to a range of landscape conditions different from the calibration scenarios, the model failed the tests for equivalence. Although our particular model failed the tests, the neutral landscape models were helpful in determining an appropriate domain of applicability and in assessing the model sensitivity to landscape changes. Equivalence testing provides an effective method for model comparison, and coupled with neutral landscapes, our approach provides an objective way to assess the domain of applicability of a spatial model. },

  abstract={ Powder injection molding (PIM) is an important net-shape manufacturing process. Thermal debinding is a common methodology for the final removal of residual polymer from a PIM compact prior to sintering. This process is an intricate combination of evaporation, liquid and gas migration, pyrolysis of polymer, and heat transfer in porous media. A better understanding of thermal debinding could lead to optimization of the process to prevent the formation of defects. Simulation of the process based on an integrated mathematical model for mass and heat transfer in porous media is proposed. The mechanisms of mass transport, i.e., liquid flow, gas flow, vapor diffusion, and convection, as well as the phase transitions of polymer, and their interactions, are included in the model. The macroscopic partial differential equations are formulated by volume averaging of the microscopic conservation laws. The basic equations consist of mass conservation and energy conservation and are solved numerically. Polymer residue, pressure, and temperature distributions are predicted. The importance of the various mass transfer mechanisms is evaluated. The effects of key mass transfer parameters on thermal debinding are discussed. It is revealed from the results that the assumed binder front, which is supposed to recede into the powder compact as removal progresses, does not exist. The mass flux of polymer liquid is of the same order of the mass flux of polymer vapor in the gas phase, and the polymer vapor diffusion in the liquid phase is negligible. },

  abstract={ Mathematical talent is an asset in modern society both at an individual and a societal level. Environmental factors such as quality of mathematics education undoubtedly affect an individual's performance, and there is some evidence that genetic factors also may play a role. The current study was performed to investigate the feasibility of undertaking genetics studies on mathematical ability. Because the etiology of low ability in mathematics is likely to be multifactorial and heterogeneous, we evaluated families ascertained through a proband with high mathematical performance in grade 7 on the SAT to eliminate, to some degree, adverse environmental factors. Families of sex-matched probands, selected for high verbal performance on the SAT, served as the comparison group. We evaluated a number of proxy measures for their usefulness in the study of clustering of mathematical talent. Given the difficulty of testing mathematics performance across developmental ages, especially with the added complexity of decreasing exposure to formal mathematics concepts post schooling, we also devised a semiquantitative scale that incorporated educational, occupational, and avocational information as a surrogate for an academic mathematics measure. Whereas several proxy measures showed no evidence of a genetic basis, we found that the semiquantitative scale of mathematical talent showed strong evidence of a genetic basis, with a differential response as a function of the performance measure used to select the proband. This observation suggests that there may be a genetic basis to specific mathematical talent, and that specific, as opposed to proxy, investigative measures that are designed to measure such talent in family members could be of benefit for this purpose. },

The dips in theT 1 dispersion allowed for the determination of the14N quadrupole coupling tensor. The fact that only one set of14N nuclear quadrupole resonance lines, has been found shows that all N-H groups in nylon-6 are H-bonded. A striking difference in the main line width transition and the low-frequency molecular dynamics has been observed between a slowly cooled “bulk” polyamide-6 sample and a rapidly cooled and highly drawn “fiber” sample by wide line proton nuclear magnetic resonance line shape and spin-lattice relaxation time measurements. This result is consistent with the picture that shearing melt processing procedures, such as spinning, plant stable and long-lived crystallization nuclei into the amorphous phase which impose additional motional constraints on the surroundings and inhibit the self-diffusion process. },

  abstract={ Traditional instructional methodology in the Information System Design (ISD) environment lacks explicit strategies for promoting the cognitive skills of prospective system designers. This contributes to the fragmented knowledge and low motivational and creative involvement of learners in system design tasks. In addition, present ISD methodologies, including web design methodologies, do not focus sufficiently on technological problem solving and design. Engagement in system design tasks demands critical thinking [Shelly, Cashman &amp; Rosenblatt, 2001, Systems Analysis and Design, 4th edn. Course Technology, Boston] and abstraction skills [Harris, 1999, Systems Analysis and Design for the Small Enterprise, The Dryden Press, Harcourt Brace College Publishers, Fort Worth]. The aim of this paper is to explain a synergy between the technological process and web design methodology and its influence on the development of the cognitive skills of learners in the ISD context. In this research, the Team Structure Software Process (TSSP) methodology was integrated with the stages of the technological process. An interface approach between Information Systems and Technology Education was adopted during the implementation of an Instructional Web Design Program (IWDP), which served as a framework for building a software product. This research was based on a qualitative, action-research approach where individual interviews, focus group interviews, observation and document sources were used to gather data. Seventeen students at an institution of higher education were observed and their experiences were investigated through a focus group interview, journals and an essay. In addition, an interview with the teacher was conducted to investigate her thoughts and feelings during the implementation of the IWDP. During the implementation of the IWDP, multi-method learning was promoted, enlarging learners' insight into the design process and a climate for enhancing intellectual processes and skills created [Jakovljevic, 2002, An Instructional Model for Teaching Complex Thinking through Web Page Design, DEd thesis, Rand Afrikaan University, Johannesburg] },

  abstract={ of magma erupted, ∼95% of which was deposited as fall layers. During most of the deposition of P1, eruptive intensity (mass flux) was almost constant at 4–8×107 kg s−1, producing a Plinian column 25–30 km in height. Size grading at the top of P1 indicates, however, that mass flux waned dramatically, and possibly that there was a brief pause in the eruption. During the post-P1 phase of the eruption, a much smaller volume of magma erupted, although mass flux varied by more than an order of magnitude. We suggest that caldera collapse began at the end of the P1 phase of the eruption, because along with the large differences in mass flux behavior between P1 and post-P1 layers, there were also dramatic changes in lithic content (P1 contains ∼8% lithics; post-P1 layers contain 30–60%) and magma composition (P1 is 98% rhyodacite; post-P1 layers are 60–90% rhyodacite). However, the total volume of magma erupted during the Jala pumice event is close to that estimated for the caldera. These observations appear to conflict with models which envision that, after an eruption is initiated by overpressure in the magma chamber, caldera collapse begins when the reservoir becomes underpressurized as a result of the removal of magma. The conflict arises because firstly, the P1 layer makes up too large a proportion (∼75%) of the total volume erupted to correspond to an overpressurized phase, and secondly, the caldera volume exceeds the post-P1 volume of magma by at least a factor of three. The mismatches between model and observations could be reconciled if collapse began near the beginning of the eruption, but no record of such early collapse is evident in the tephra sequence. The apparent inability to place the Jala pumice eruptive sequence into existing models of caldera collapse, which were constructed to explain the formation of calderas much greater in volume than that at Ceboruco, may indicate that differences in caldera mechanics exist that depend on size or that a more general model for caldera formation is needed. },

Evaluation of all compounds for the interactions with the parameters of lowest binding energy levels, capability of hydrogen bond formations and superimposibility on enzyme active site by docking studies, it can be assumed that 3-(substituted- benzylidene)-1, 3-dihydro-indolin-2-one and thione derivatives have better interaction with enzyme active site then 2, 2′-dithiobis 3-(substituted- benzylidene)-1, 3-dihydro indole derivatives.

  abstract={ The D-type and E-type cyclins control the G1 to S phase transition during normal cell cycle progression and are critical components of steroid- and growth factor-induced mitogenesis in breast epithelial cells. Mammary epithelial cell-specific overexpression of these genes leads to mammary carcinoma, while in cyclin D1-deficient mice mammary gland development is arrested prior to lobuloalveolar development. Cyclin D1 null mice are resistant to mammary carcinoma induced by the neu and ras oncogenes, indicating an essential role for cyclin D1 in the development of some mammary cancers. Cyclin D1 and E1 are commonly overexpressed in primary breast cancer, with some evidence of an association with an adverse patient outcome. This observation may result in part from their ability to confer resistance to endocrine therapies. The functional consequences of cyclin E overexpression in breast cancer are likely related to its role in cell cycle progression, whereas that of cyclin D1 may also be a consequence of a more recently defined role in transcriptional regulation. },

  abstract={ The two LOV domains, LOV1 and LOV2, from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were investigated by light-induced FT-IR difference spectroscopy and compared to the LOV domain of Bacillus subtilis (YtvA-LOV). It is shown that the two S–H conformations of the reactive LOV1 cysteine C57(1) are exposed to environments of different hydrogen bonding strength. Thus, the two rotamer configurations of C57 might be related to the fact that the triplet state decays bi-exponentially into the LOV1-390 photoproduct. Exchange of the two other cysteines of LOV1 (C32S and C83S) does not alter the S–H stretching band providing evidence that this band feature arises solely from C57. The reactive cysteine of LOV2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C250) and of YtvA-LOV (C62) exhibit both a homogenous S–H stretching vibrational band which suggests a single conformer of the amino acid side chain. Finally, the FT-IR difference spectrum of YtvA from Bacillus subtilis comprising the light absorbing LOV domain and the putative signaling STAS (sulfate transporter/antisigma-factor antagonist) domain, reveals conformational changes in the latter after blue-light excitation. },

  abstract={ YtvA is a bacterial flavo-protein related to plant phototropin. The photochemistry of YtvA and of its isolated LOV domain (YtvA-LOV) has been characterized by optical, mass spectrometric and photocalorimetric methods. The energy content (E390) of the FMN-C4a-thiol photoadduct (YtvA390 and YtvA-LOV390) and its structural volume change (ΔV390), with respect to the parent state, have been determined by means of Laser Induced Optoacoustic Spectroscopy (LIOAS). The high value of E390, 136 and 115 kJ mol−1, respectively, ensures a large driving force for the dark recovery to the unphotolyzed state and points to a strained conformation of the protein or/and the chromophore in the photoadduct. The value of ΔV390 is significantly different for the two proteins, ΔV390 = −12.5 ml mol−1 in YtvA and −17.2 ml mol−1 in YtvA-LOV. The kinetics of the dark recovery reaction for YtvA-LOV is slower than for full-length YtvA, with τrec = 3900 and 2600 s at 25 °C, respectively, and shows a different temperature dependence. A similarly slow kinetics can be induced in YtvA by high ionic strength. Minor differences are observed in the fluorescence and photoadduct formation quantum yield. The overall stability is higher for YtvA than for YtvA-LOV. The data as a whole are indicative of an interaction between the two domains of YtvA, most probably mediated by electrostatic interactions that renders the full-length protein a compact and more rigid unit. The results reported here support the idea that the formation of the photoadduct changes the dynamics of the protein, depending on the conformational flexibility of the parent state. Flashing of the photoadduct induces a negligible ΔV, with 96% of the excitation energy dissipated as heat in &lt;20 ns, indicating that the photoadduct does not undergo a photocycle on the LIOAS time scale, or that the photoinduced reactions occur with very low yield. },

Some investigations of its role in mammary development have demonstrated reduced cyclin D1 expression and consequent lack of lobuloalveolar development, but others have found increased cyclin E–Cdk2 activity and increased proliferation balanced by increased apoptosis. It is unclear at present why these apparently divergent results have been obtained. Mice with reduced p27 gene dosage alone do not develop mammary carcinomas but do display substantially shorter tumor latency upon overexpression of erbB2, consistent with a role for p27 as a mammary tumor suppressor gene. In this review we summarize these and other data addressing the role of p27 in normal mammary epithelium and experimental models of mammary carcinogenesis. },

  abstract={ Edge effect is an inherent problem when using trapping grids to estimate density of small mammals, resulting in a sampling area larger than the area of the grid. Distances between captures of individuals are used to estimateA(W), the effective sampling area of a trapping grid, but grid size sets a limit for the largest detectable distance. The spool-and-line technique is proposed here as a new method to estimateA(W). Movement distances based on the spool-and-line technique were compared to similar movement distances based on capture-recapture of three species of marsupials of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Distances based on the two methods were uncorrelated, and only ln-transformed distances based on the spool-and-line were normally distributed. The maximum distance moved (MaxD) estimated by the spool-and-line was chosen as the more accurate and practical distance to estimate edge effect. Estimates of the effective sampling area and densities for the common opossumDidelphis aurita (Wied-Neuwied, 1826), were compared using MaxD based on spool-and-line (MaxDs p o o l ) , capture-recapture (MaxDcap), and also the distance between traps (DT). MaxDspool reflected more accurately density variation between seasons. Movement distances of small mammals based on the spool-and-line technique permit more accurate estimates of density and its dynamics. },

  abstract={ Muscarinic receptor-mediated changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation were examined in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment of differentiated cells with 1 mM carbachol caused rapid increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Cas, and paxillin. The src family kinase-selective inhibitor PP1 reduced carbachol-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, Cas, and paxillin by 50 to 75%. In contrast, carbachol-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 was unaffected by PP1. Src family kinase activation by carbachol was further demonstrated by increased carbachol-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the src-substrate, p120, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the src family kinase activation-associated autophosphorylation site. Site-specific FAK phosphotyrosine antibodies were used to determine that the carbachol-stimulated increase in the autophosphorylation of FAK was unaffected by pretreatment with PP1, whereas the carbachol-stimulated increase in the src family kinase-mediated phosphotyrosine of FAK was completely blocked by pretreatment with PP1. In SH-SY5Y cell lines stably overexpressing Fyn, the phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity of FAK was 625% that of control cells. Thus, muscarinic receptors activate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in differentiated cells, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, Cas, and paxillin, but not ERK1/2, is mediated by a src family tyrosine kinase activated in response to stimulation of muscarinic receptors. },

Dedicated types have evolved, which can be classified in six families: rhodopsins, phytochromes, xanthopsins, cryptochromes, phototropins and BLUF-proteins. The photochemistry of the first three families is based on cis/trans isomerization of an ethylene bond. Surprisingly, the latter three all use flavin as their chromophore, but each with very different photochemistry. In this contribution we will discuss the molecular basis of signal generation in a xanthopsin (Photoactive Yellow Protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila), a photoreceptor for negative phototaxis, and in a BLUF protein (AppA from Rhodobacter sphaeroides), a transcriptional anti-repressor. PYP is activated through trans/cis isomerization of the 7,8-vinyl bond of its 4-hydroxycinnamic acid chromophore. This initiates a photocycle with multiple intermediates, like pB, which is formed after intramolecular proton transfer. The negative charge thus formed in the interior of the protein triggers formation of a partially unfolded signaling state. For AppA much less is known about the underlying photochemistry. Available evidence suggests that it is based on a light-induced change in the hydrogen-bonding of its flavin chromophore and/or a change in hydrophobic stacking between the flavin and/or nearby aromatic amino acids like Y21. A signaling state is formed within microseconds, which recovers with a rate of ~10-3 s-1. The change in conformation between receptor- and signaling-state in AppA, however, appear to be minute as compared to those in PYP. Here we review the underlying chemistry in the various steps of the photocycle of these two photoreceptor proteins and provide new data on their mechanism and function. },

  abstract={ To characterize the molecular mechanisms by which progesterone withdrawal initiates milk secretion, we examined global gene expression during pregnancy and lactation in mice, focusing on the period around parturition. Trajectory clustering was used to profile the expression of 1358 genes that changed significantly between pregnancy day 12 and lactation day 9. Predominantly downward trajectories included stromal and proteasomal genes and genes for the enzymes of fatty acid degradation. Milk protein gene expression increased throughout pregnancy, whereas the expression of genes for lipid synthesis increased sharply at the onset of lactation. Examination of regulatory genes with profiles similar or complementary to those of lipid synthesis genes led to a model in which progesterone stimulates synthesis of TGF-β, Wnt 5b, and IGFBP-5 during pregnancy. These factors are suggested to repress secretion by interfering with PRL and IGF-1 signaling. With progesterone withdrawal, PRL and IGF-1 signaling are activated, in turn activating Akt/PKB and the SREBPs, leading to increased lipid synthesis. },

  abstract={ Near-threshold ultraviolet-laser (355 nm) ablation of 125-μm thick Kapton films was investigated in detail using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Different from the irradiation at higher fluences, the contents of the oxygen, amide group, and C–O group on the ablated surface increased with an increase in the pulse number, whereas the carbon contents decreased, although the contents of the nitrogen and the carbonyl group (C = O) decreased slightly. This implied that there was no carbon-rich residue on the ablated surface. Near the ablation threshold, only photolysis of the C–N bond in the imide rings and the diaryl ether group (C–O) took place due to a low surface temperature rise, and the amide structure and many unstable free radical groups were created. Sequentially, the oxidation reaction occurred to stabilize the free radical groups. The decomposition and oxidation mechanism could explain the intriguing changes of the chemical composition and characteristics of the ablated surface. In addition, the content of the C–O group depended on the opposite factors: the thermally induced decomposition of the ether groups and the pyrolysis of the Caryl–C bond. Upon further irradiation, the cumulative heating may induce the breakage of the Caryl–C bond and enhance the oxidation reaction, resulting in an increase of the content of the C–O group. },

In contrast to previously reported designed photoswitchable proteins where DNA binding affinity is enhanced upon irradiation, GCN4(S)Δ25PYP dissociates from DNA when irradiated with blue light.

  abstract={ The purple photosynthetic bacteria contain a large variety of sensory and regulatory proteins, and those responding to light are among the most interesting. These currently include bacteriophytochrome (Bph), sensory rhodopsin (SR), and photoactive yellow protein (PYP), which all appear to function as light sensors. We herein interpret new findings within the context of current knowledge. For greater detail, the reader is referred to comprehensive reviews on these topics. Of the three proteins, only PYP has been well-characterized in terms of structure and physical-chemical properties in the purple bacteria, although none have well-defined functions. New findings include a cluster of six genes in the Thermochromatium tepidum genome that encodes presumed sensory rhodopsin and phototaxis proteins. T. tepidum also has a gene for PYP fused to bacteriophytochrome and diguanylate cyclase domains. The genes for PYP and its biosynthetic enzymes are associated with those for gas vesicle formation in Rhodobacter species, suggesting that one function of PYP is to regulate cell buoyancy. The association of bacteriophytochrome genes with those for reaction centers and light-harvesting proteins in Rhodopseudomonas palustris suggests that the photosynthetic antenna as well as the reaction center are regulated by Bphs. Furthermore, Rc. centenum PPR is reversibly photobleached at 702 nm rather than red-shifted as in other phytochromes, suggesting that PPR senses the intensity of white light rather than light quality. PYP from Halorhodospira (aka Ectothiorhodospira) halophila is of special interest because it has become the structural prototype for the PAS domain, a motif that is found throughout the phylogenetic tree and which plays important roles in many signaling pathways. Thus, the structural and photochemical characterization of PYP, utilizing site-directed mutagenesis, provides insights into the mechanism of signal transduction. },

  abstract={ The humor response has long been considered mysterious, and it is given relatively little attention in modern experimental psychology, in spite of the fact that numerous studies suggest that it has substantial benefits for mood and health. Existing theories of humor fail to account for some of the most basic humor phenomena. On most occasions when a humor response occurs, certain verbal or visual stimuli (the “setup” stimuli, which function as an establishing operation) must precede a critical stimulus (such as a “punch line” or the final panel or critical feature of a cartoon), which then occasions a sudden “revelation” or “understanding”; this revelation is often accompanied by the humor response. We suggest that the setup stimuli increase the strength of the revelatory response to a point just below the threshold of awareness and that the critical stimulus, properly designed and timed, edges the revelatory response to a point just above threshold. We also suggest that it is this threshold phenomenon that produces most instances of the humor response. We discuss these issues in the context of some notable humor of Carl Rogers and B. F. Skinner. },

  abstract={ Prenylated Ras GTPases transduce signals from the T cell receptor, CD28 costimulatory receptor and IL-2 receptor. Since signals from these receptors mediate T cell activation, proliferation and survival, we hypothesized that the prenylation inhibitor L-778,123 would impart immunomodulation. The effect of L-778,123 on T cell activation (CD71 or CD25 surface expression) was determined by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in the presence of L-778,123 and/or cyclosporine (CsA) was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The ability of L-778,123 to inhibit IL-2 receptor signaling was investigated by measuring IL-2 induced proliferation in CTLL-2 cells and IL-2 prevention of apoptosis in activated human PBMC. L-778,123 inhibited lectin induced expression of CD71 and CD25 with IC50's of 6.48 ± 1.31 μM and 84.1 ± 50.0 μM, respectively. PBMC proliferation was inhibited by L-778,123 with an IC50 of 0.92 ± 0.23 μM, and addition of CsA did not increase the potency. L-778,123 did not inhibit IL-2 and IFN-γ production by T cells. L-778,123 abrogated IL-2 induced proliferation of CTLL-2 cells with an IC50 of 0.81 ± 0.44 μM. However, L-778,123 minimally reversed the prosurvival effect of IL-2 in activated lymphocytes. IL-2 ligand and receptor production during T cell activation are relatively unaffected by L-778,123. However, the activation and proliferative effects of IL-2 on T cells are potently blocked by L-778,123. These results reveal a selective blockade of the IL-2 cytokine axis distal to the IL-2 receptor by the L-778,123 and warrant evaluation of prenylation inhibitors in treating transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases. },

Gene ablation and transgenic expression studies strongly support the concept that β-catenin together with Lef/Tcf factors act as a switch to determine cell fate and promote cell survival and proliferation at several stages during mammary gland development. Mice expressing the negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (K14-Dkk) fail to form mammary buds, and those lacking Lef-1 show an early arrest in this process at stage E13.5. Stabilized ΔN89β-catenin initiates precocious alveologenesis during pubertal development, and negative regulators of endogenous β-catenin signaling suppress normal alveologenesis during pregnancy. Stabilized β-catenin induces hyperplasia and mammary tumors in mice. Each of the β-catenin-induced phenotypes is accompanied by upregulation of the target genes cyclin D1 and c-myc. Cyclin D1, however, is dispensable for tumor formation and the initiation of alveologenesis but is essential for later alveolar expansion. },

Polarizing light microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectra were used to study, in situ record the evolution of morphological change in the thin-film polymerization process, and confirm the occurrence of polymerization. Experimental results indicated that monomer structure and composition as well as temperature influence the formation of the liquid crystalline (LC) phase greatly and revealed that 2,5-thiophene structure is a viable mesogenic core unit. It is more effective than isophthalic acid (IA) in assisting in the LC formation as polymers containing TDA have a better developed LC phase and lower critical ABA content than those with IA. Stripe texture was observed in the ANA/DABP/TDA system, possibly due to the structural characteristics and matching of the monomers. The decrease of isotropic round areas in the LC phase and the annihilation between two pairs of defects with reaction time were also studied. },

  abstract={ The steroid hormone, progesterone (P), is a central coordinator of all aspects of female reproductive activity and plays a key role in pregnancy-associated mammary gland morphogenesis and mammary tumorigenesis. The effects of P on the mammary gland are mediated by two structurally and functionally distinct nuclear receptors PR-A and PR-B that arise from a single gene. Null mutation of both receptors in PR knockout (PRKO) mice has demonstrated a critical role for PRs in mediating pregnancy-associated mammary ductal branching and lobuloalveolar differentiation and in initiation of mammary tumors in response to carcinogen. Analysis of the molecular genetic pathways disrupted in PRKO mice has recently yielded important insights into the molecular mechanisms of regulation of mammary gland morphogenesis by PRs. In addition to its essential role in regulating proliferative and differentiative responses of the adult mammary gland during pregnancy, P plays a critical role in the protection against mammary tumorigenesis afforded by early parity. Thus, the effects of P on postnatal developmental plasticity of the mammary gland differ between young and adult glands. This review will summarize recent advances in our understanding of 1) the molecular mechanisms by which PRs mediate pregnancy-associated mammary gland morphogenesis, 2) the role of PRs in mediating tumorigenic responses of the adult mammary gland to carcinogen, and 3) the role of P in long-term protection of the juvenile mammary gland against tumorigenesis. In addition, we will summarize recent insights into the isoform selective contributions to some of these activities of PRs obtained from comparative analysis of P-dependent mammary gland development in PR isoform specific knockout mice lacking either the PR-A (PRAKO) or PR-B (PRBKO). },

  abstract={ Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, can lead to the development of hamartomas in various organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, skin and brain. The management of subependymal giant cell tumors (SGCTs) is still controversial, and peri- and/or intraventricular neoplasms may lead to life-threatening hydrocephalus. In the last years, many progresses have been made in research into the tumorigenesis and behaviors of SGCTs. This review aims to clarify the specific role of neurosurgeons in the multidisciplinary management of SGCTs in children with TSC. Based on the recent scientific literature and personal experience, we reviewed the up-to-date data and discussed the trends in the management of SGCTs in children with TSC. The data were collected after a bibliography made using PubMed/Medline with these terms: subependymal, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, subependymal giant cell tumor, and tuberous sclerosis complex. SGCTs are shown to be generated from a glioneuronal lineage, but their filiation with subependymal nodules (SENs) is still under debate. While SENs may develop anywhere in the ventricular walls, SGCTs arise almost exclusively around the Monro foramina. In children with TSC, precise clinical and/or imaging criteria are mandatory to differentiate SENs that are always asymptomatic and riskless from SGCTs that have the potential to grow and therefore to obstruct cerebrospinal fluid pathways leading to hydrocephalus. An earlier diagnosis of SGCT in neurologically asymptomatic children with TSC may allow a precocious surgical removal of the tumor before the installation of increased intracranial pressure signs, an attitude that is being progressively adopted to lessen the morbimortality rate. },

  abstract={ The diabetic patient is at high risk for coronary artery disease. Incidence as well as severity of the disease is highly increased in comparison to non–diabetic patients. The revascularization of the diabetic patient is a great challenge, since the longterm results are disappointing when compared to non–diabetic patients. The success of coronary artery bypass grafting is limited by increased perioperative mortality and a faster occlusion of especially venous bypass grafts. In percutaneous interventions the excessive high restenosis rates worsen longterm results. Several clinical trials investigated the outcome of the two revascularization strategies and could demonstrate at least a tendency towards better results when the operative approach was chosen. Particularily, the BARI trial showed reduced mortality for surgery when compared to percutaneous coronary interventions. However, in this trial, in 87% of patients undergoing bypass surgery all stenoses were succesfully treated, whereas in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention only 76% of all stenoses were primarily succesfully treated. In addition, no stents were used in this trial. Furthermore, the enrollment of the previous trials dates one decade ago. These trials do therefore not necessarily represent the current standard therapy, especially for percutaneous coronary interventions. The restenosis rate could be decreased in recent years by means of drug–eluting stents and an aggressive antiplatelet therapy from more than 50% to less than 10% leading to considerably improved long–term results. Therefore, percutaneous coronary interventions have developed to be a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery. Different clinical trials are currently underway (BARI 2D, CarDIA, FREEDOM) comparing the outcome of the two approaches. },

Each of these knowledge-related themes emerged in collaborative discussions that transcended national, occupational, and cultural boundaries. The paper takes the position that dialogue regarding the nature and usefulness of knowledge paradoxically takes an inward view as it develops outwardly to the case of others and the world. In a collaborative process of this nature, an important dimension of shared human meaning making becomes briefly revealed. },

  abstract={ Grundlagen: Die Behandlung des Bauchtraumas im Wachstumsalter hat sich zunehmend in Richtung nicht-operative Therapie entwickelt, wobei Abdomen-Ultraschall-Untersuchungen die am häufigsten verwendete bildgebende Untersuchung darstellen. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, die Vor- und Nachteile dieser Behandlungsstrategie aufzuzeigen. Methodik: In einer Übersicht werden die Grundzüge der Versorgung des stumpfen Bauchtraumas im Wachstumsalter dargestellt. Ergebnisse: Innerhalb eines Jahres wurden an der Universitätsklinik für Kinderchirurgie 180 Kinder und Jugendliche wegen des Verdachts auf ein stumpfes Bauchtraumas vorgestellt. 23 Kinder wiesen intraabdominelle Organverletzungen auf, darunter 4 mehrfachverletzte Kinder. Ein strukturierter Teameinsatz sowie eine standardisierte Ultraschalluntersuchung des Abdomens und der Pleura in Kombination mit Nierenduplex-Sonographie haben sich bewährt. Die Mehrzahl von stumpfen Bauchtraumen in dieser Altersgruppe läßt sich nicht-operativ behandeln. Die Hauptproblematik ergibt sich aus dem mitunter sehr schwierigen Ausschluß operationsbedürftiger (Begleit-)Verletzungen, wobei gedeckte Hohlorganverletzungen, Verletzungen der Mesenterica superior-Gefäße und Zwerchfellrupturen besonders bei mehrfachverletzten und bewußtseinsgetrübten Kindern schwierig zu diagnostizieren sind. Schlußfolgerungen: Das stumpfe Bauchtrauma im Wachstumsalter ist eine Domäne der konservativen Therapie, die Hauptproblematik liegt dabei im Ausschluß operationsbedürftiger (Zusatz-)Verletzungen. },

  abstract={ Lovis Corinth erlitt in seinem 54. Lebensjahr einen rechtshemisphärischen Schlaganfall, den er um 14 Jahre überlebte. Die immense Zahl seiner Werke nach diesem einschneidenden Lebensereignis lässt eine ausführliche Analyse und einen Vergleich zum Werk vor Dezember 1911 zu. Mit den Augen des Neurologen erschließt sich dabei eine erstaunliche Vielfalt von teilweise subtilen Auswirkungen des Schlaganfalls, die eindeutig über rein psychologische Prozesse hinausgehen und im Wesentlichen mit einem linksseitigen Neglect zu erklären sind. Corinth ist darüber hinaus aber auch ein motivierendes Beispiel für Patienten, indem er nach seinem Schlaganfall großartige Kunst produzierte. Lovis Corinth kämpfte dabei weniger gegen seine motorische Behinderung, die sein Wirken nicht relevant beeinträchtigte als viel eher mit seinem neuropsychologischen Defizit, welches deutliche Auswirkungen für seine künstlerische Produktion hatte. Corinth hinterließ der Nachwelt sein Credo „Die wahre Kunst ist Unwirklichkeit üben“. Für dieses Zitat, wie auch für den von ihm oft zitierten Ausspruch „Zeichnen heißt weglassen“, ergibt sich eine schlüssige Interpretationsmöglichkeit, die sich aus dem Verständnis der rechtshemisphärischen Läsion mit der Folge des linksseitigen Neglects ableitet. },

  abstract={ In the past 15&nbsp;years, numerous reforms and initiatives in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have aimed to change education and promote new learning to prepare the new generation for the future. Unfortunately, despite good intentions and huge investments of resources, many of these reforms have been found to be ineffective and unsustainable—if they succeed at all. Reflecting on the trends and waves of educational reform in the Asia-Pacific region, this paper introduces an international lesson on the emerging syndrome of educational reform across the region and illustrates its negative impacts on teacher ecology and teacher management. Then, the paper outlines the implications of this lesson and of a study of the world’s best-performing educational systems, using them to develop a holistic approach to managing teachers and planning for their sustainable professional development. Finally, it highlights the paradigm shifts in teacher management, reviewing the three waves of educational reform in the last two decades, and draws further implications for formulating teacher management policies in ongoing and future educational reforms to support students’ new learning and sustainable development. },

Therefore planning processes that are suitable for generating successful strategies are gaining importance under the condition of a highly dynamic environment. This paper offers a framework of basic dimensions of planning processes which are seen in the itensity, the rationality and the openness of the planning process. To test the impact on success for all three dimensions empirically, data were collected in 220 german manufacturing firms and analyzed using moderated regression analysis. A high rationality was found to be generally superior. The impact of the intensity and the openness of the planning process on the success depends however on the dynamism of the environment. Under dynamic conditions a high intensity of planning and an open planning process are promising. },

  abstract={ Because of the importance of Confucian doctrines in shaping ethical business practices under Chinese leadership, revealing the roles of other Chinese ethical doctrines in modern Chinese leadership is informative. A thorough understanding of the ethical foundations of Chinese leadership is necessary for fruitful interaction with Chinese leaders, according to cultural fit theory. The present study illustrates the philosophical foundations of business management, based on dialogues with five eminent corporate executive officers (CEOs). It reveals that the CEOs practice a style of Chinese leadership synthesizing Confucian, Daoist, Mohist, and Legalist doctrines. The Confucian doctrines advocate benevolence, harmony, learning, loyalty, righteousness, and humility. They are the most prevalent tenets that support paternalism and collectivism. The Daoist doctrines emphasize flexibility and reversion (e.g., the principle that the weak can defeat the strong). They bolster the leader’s forbearance. The Mohist doctrines underpin thrift and working with the masses whereas the Legalist doctrines inculcate self-control and innovativeness. Hence, contemporary Chinese leadership does not rely exclusively on Confucian ethics and this reflects evolution over 1000s of years. },

Data were collected from teachers, children and designers through interviews, classroom observations and dialogue, photographs and design documents. This paper focuses on the ‘school situated design’ evidence from the study – the teacher and student data – and refers only briefly to designer data to compare school activities to ‘workplace design.’ We call professional designers' designerly thinking and behaviours workplace design.

Dem Patienten kann sein Ausgangszustand bildlich dargestellt werden — was für den Menschen als visuell ausgerichtetem Individuum von viel höherer Aussagekraft ist als jede mündliche Beschreibung. Methodik: Die Bilddokumentation wird mittels standardisierter Aufnahmefolge mit Kleinbild- oder Digitalequipment ausgeführt, die Videodokumentation erfolgt durch fix montierte und mit Weitwinkelobjektiv ausgestattete Camcorder. Ergebnisse: Die Dokumentation des Heilungsverlaufes mittel klinischer Bilder erlaubt oft eine bessere Aussage als eine Röntgenbildserie. Vorhandenes Bildmaterial kann bei viel später geforderter Information (z. B. bei Versicherungs- oder Gerichtsverfahren) sowohl dem behandelnden Arzt als auch dem Patienten Details in Erinnerung bringen, auf welche sonst nicht mehr zurückgegriffen werden könnte. Bei regelmäßiger Bild- und Videodokumentation und nachfolgender Analyse können eine Verbesserung im Schockraummanagement erzielt und Fehler aufgedeckt werden. Schlußfolgerungen: Auf Bilddokumentation im Schockraum sollte bei Mehrfachverletzten, besonders aber beim Intubierten nicht verzichtet werden. Die Videoaufzeichnung und Analyse verbessert das Schockraummanagement und die Versorgungsqualität. Niemals aber darf es durch diese Art der Dokumentation zu einem Schaden des Patienten kommen, sei es durch Zeitverzögerung oder aber auch unsachgemäßes Verwenden des Bildmaterials bezogen auf den Datenschutz. },

  abstract={ One of the principle reasons responsible for the fact that nurturing the gifted and talented in Germany has (once again) advanced to a pedagogic concern in the 1990’s lies in the dichotomy of equality and excellence. Are these two pedagogic goals actually incompatible, as often maintained in open discussions? After a long period of oscillation between these two poles, in the age of information a new emphasis has increasingly been placed on excellence. “It becomes more and more important for bright students to be using their abilities to stimulate this new era with economic and political productivity. But this will not happen if the current ‘laissez faire’ approach to gifted students continues into the next decade”(Gallagher, 2000, p. 691). Following a short definition of giftedness and related conceptions, arguments for gifted education stemming from the areas of learning psychology and instructional psychology will be discussed. The central problems concerning identification and programming will then be addressed in greater detail. Hypotheses will be developed, on the basis of the ATI model that gifted students need creative, stimulating learning environments. Various approaches will be presented here and discussed in the context of TIMSS and PISA. The second part of the article will deal with guidance and counseling issues with respect to the special needs of gifted children and adolescents and their social contact persons (peers, parents, teachers). In conclusion, German program evaluation, studies in the fields of gifted education, counseling and nurturing giftedness and talent will be presented. The outcomes of these studies and their consequences for improvements for the quality of gifted and talented education and counseling in Germany will be discussed. Excellence is one of the most important educational-psychological challenges of the new century. },

Dry matter concentration, assessed as under-water weight, was reduced by chloride in both cultivars at the two locations. Fry colour of French fries was improved by chloride. Applying 400 kg ha−1 Cl− to both soil types decreased net tuber yield &gt;35 mm of cv. Bintje but not of cv. Marijke.

This paper reports on a study conducted with both primary and secondary technology initial teacher education students in a number of different countries who were given the same teacher-knowledge graphical framework as a tool to support reflection on their own professional knowledge. We wanted to investigate if, despite the different country contexts, student teachers of technology could take advantage of their experience with graphic visualisation to help them articulate abstract notions such as aspects of their developing teacher knowledge. We discovered that the graphical tool acted as a framework that enabled them to set out their subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and `school' knowledge and was useful in helping them become more self-aware. In this paper, the framework itself is introduced, the way it was presented to the novice teachers is outlined and the relative impact of such `self awareness' on their understandings, enabled by the framework, is then discussed. },

  abstract={ Surgical education is evolving under the dual pressures of an enlarging body of knowledge required during residency and mounting work-hour restrictions. Changes in surgical residency training need to be based on available educational models and research to ensure successful training of surgeons. Experiential learning theory, developed by David Kolb, demonstrates the importance of individual learning styles in improving learning. This study helps elucidate the way in which medical students, surgical residents, and surgical faculty learn. The Kolb Learning Style Inventory, which divides individual learning styles into Accommodating, Diverging, Converging, and Assimilating categories, was administered to the second year undergraduate medical students, general surgery resident body, and general surgery faculty at the University of Alberta. A total of 241 faculty, residents, and students were surveyed with an overall response rate of 73%. The predominant learning style of the medical students was assimilating and this was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.03) from the converging learning style found in the residents and faculty. The predominant learning styles of the residents and faculty were convergent and accommodative, with no statistically significant differences between the residents and the faculty. We conclude that medical students have a significantly different learning style from general surgical trainees and general surgeons. This has important implications in the education of general surgery residents. },

The continuous loss of fertile soil obliged the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to declare soil as an item to be protected as a support of the world society welfare. The procedure here described is in accordance with the premises necessary for a rational and sustainable development of soil and the resources it contains and can be used to study any soil all over the world. The study was carried out using soil microbial population as a bioindicator of soil health. Microbial activity was followed using the microcalorimetric technique. The microcalorimetric study can be complemented through a deep analysis of soil physical, chemical and biological properties together with a study of the environmental properties that have a strong influence on the afore mentioned properties and, thus on the microbial activity in soil.

  abstract={ The productivity of plantation forests is essential to meet the future world demand for wood and wood products in a sustainable fashion and in a manner that preserves natural stands and biodiversity. Plantation forestry has enormously benefited from development and implementation of improved silvicultural and forest management practices during the past century. A second wave of improvements has been brought about by the introduction of new germplasm developed through genetics and breeding efforts for both hardwood and conifer tree species. Coupled with the genetic gains achieved through tree breeding, the emergence of new biotechnological approaches that span the fields of plant developmental biology, genetic transformation, and discovery of genes associated with complex multigenic traits have added a new dimension to forest tree improvement programs. Significant progress has been made during the past five years in the area of plant regeneration via organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis (SE) for economically important tree species. These advances have not only helped the development of efficient gene transfer techniques, but also have opened up avenues for deployment of new high-performance clonally replicated planting stocks in forest plantations. One of the greatest challenges today is the ability to extend this technology to the most elite germplasm, such that it becomes an, economically feasible means for large-scale production and delivery of improved planting stock. Another challenge will be the ability of the forestry research community to capitalize rapidly on current and future genomics-based elucidation of the underlying mechanisms for important but complex phenotypes. Advancements in gene cloning and genomics technology in forest trees have enabled the discovery and introduction of value-added traits for wood quality and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses into improved genotypes. With these technical advancements, it will be necessary for reliable regulatory infrastructures and processes to be in place worldwide for testing and release of trees improved through biotechnology. Commercialization of planting stocks, as new varieties generated through clonal propagation and advanced breeding programs or as transgenic trees with high-value traits, is expected in the near future, and these trees will enhance the quality and productivity of our plantation forests. },

While there was little evidence to show improvements in content knowledge, results indicate that the case acted as a boundary object for brokering between individual experiences and those found in the science teaching community by scaffolding for multiple points of entry, bridging the theory practice gap and offering beginning teachers more immediate access to the community of already practicing teachers. },

  abstract={ The effect of shear or time of shearing – as exerted by different screw configurations – upon the nano hydroxyapatite (n-HA) dispersion, during the twin screw extrusion processing for the preparation of PA6-66/n-HA composites, was investigated. Three different screw configurations, designated as medium, high and very high shear, were used. A noticeable improvement in the n-HA dispersion, attributed to the increasing shear exerted upon the melt during mixing in the TSE, was observed. Crystallization and thermal behavior of n-HA reinforced PA6-66 composites were studied by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An increase in the crystallization temperature, accompanied by a decrease in percent crystallinity with the addition of n-HA to the PA6-66 matrix was observed. That is, n-HA acted as a nucleating agent and enhanced the crystallization rate. In addition, it was observed that the n-HA promoted the occurrence of the Brill transition. The decomposition temperature increased with the addition of n-HA. The PA6-66/ n-HA nanocomposite was thereafter, immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) and the generation of a new calcium phosphate layer on the nanocomposite surface was monitored by SEM, FTIR and Atomic Absorption. The Ca/P ratio in the forming apatite layer started at a low value, ca. 1.3, which corresponds to octacalcic phosphate, but increased with the immersion time to 1.6, which corresponds to carbonated apatite. },

Embryogenic tissue of P. roxburghii Sarg. was cryopreserved for 24 h, 10 d, and 8 wk using sorbitol and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as cryoprotectants. Results indicate that 0.2M sorbitol and 5% DMSO had the best cryoprotecting effect. The recovered tissue showed luxuriant growth on maintenance medium (II). Partial desiccation of thawed embryogenic tissue for 24 h prior to transfer to maturation medium enhanced the maturation of somatic embryos. Maturation frequency increased from 1.3 to 18.3% after 12 h desiccation treatment, and from 18.3 to 61.8% after 24 h of desiccation. However, non-desiccated embryogenic tissue produced the least number of somatic embryos (1.3%) on the maturation medium with the same abscisic acid and Gellan gum concentration. All the three embryogenic lines produced plantlets and had the same appearance and normal growth as compared to unfrozen controls. },

Six transclones were recovered from a total of 215 bombardments. Expression of the β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) was confirmed by histochemical analysis, and expression of npt II was verified by quantification of NPTII protein by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both genes were still expressed in the embryogenic tissue after 5 yr of in vitro culture and in mature somatic embryos and plants produced from these cultures. The integration of npt II was confirmed by Southern hybridization in embryogenic tissue after 5 yr of culture. After 5 yr of growth, uidA was still expressed in needles from the transformed trees. },

Tench fish-farms are a particularly good tool for educating children in the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems. The ‘Vegas del Guadiana’ fish farm (Badajoz, Spain) Environmental Education Programme, is included in the Transborder Environmental Education Programme and in INTERREG II, an European Community Initiative whose objective is to promote cross-border, international and interregional co-operation to encourage balanced development in Europe. Preliminary results have been evaluated and presented in the present work. The analysis of the efficiency of the programme was measured in children from ages 6 to 12. The results showed no significant differences among sex (t-Student=0.07, p=0.9470) nor social surroundings (t-Student=0.87, p=0.3910) but there were significant differences when comparing different ages (ANOVA, p=0.0437). In all cases, a significant increase in the knowledge and concern about the freshwater environment was found in children (Paired t-Student=−10.55, p=0.0001). },

  abstract={ Over the past 20 years, DNA-based biotechnologies have been applied to agricultural production and many crops with new and useful attributes have been cultivated in various countries. The adoption of this new technology by farmers has been swift, and benefits in terms of increased production per unit land and environmental benefits are becoming obvious. In forestry, the application of biotechnology is somewhat lagging behind and to date there are no commercial plantations with genetically modified trees. However, most tree species used in plantation forestry have been genetically transformed, and results demonstrate the successful and correct expression of new genes in these plants. At the same time, this new technology is being viewed with concern, very similar to the concerns voiced over the use of genetic engineering in agriculture. This paper discusses some of the issues involved for world forestry, with particular focus on future demand for timber and timber products and how modern biotechnology can contribute to meet the growing demand. Tree genetic engineering techniques will be outlined, and results reviewed for a number of species. Concerns over the use of this new technology will be described and analyzed in relation to scientific considerations. },

  abstract={ Traditional breeding has been widely used in forestry. However, this technique is inefficient because trees have a long and complex life cycle that is not amenable to strict control by man. Fortunately, the development of genetic engineering is offering new ways of breeding and allowing the incorporation of new traits in plant species through the introduction of foreign genes (transgenes). The introduction of selected traits can be used to increase the productivity and commercial value of trees and other plants. For example, some species have been endowed with resistance to herbicide and pathogens such as insects and fungi. Also, it has been possible to introduce genes that modify development and wood quality, and induce sexual sterility. The development of transgenic trees has required the implementation of in vitro regeneration techniques such as organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. Release of transgenic species into the agricultural market requires a standardized biosafety regulatory frame and effective communication between the scientific community and society to dissipate the suspicions associated with transgenic products. },

  abstract={ The new argumentative and communicative approach to environmental planning is replacing the traditional approach of planning derived from cybernetic models and based on the linear control of systems' dynamics. The traditional absolute monologic rationality of planning is today challenged by more complex, multilogic, multivalue and weak rationality, explicitly contextualized to different social and physical environments. Not achieving targets, but rather building discourses and visions related to evolving situations are the new grounds of planning processes, where different stakeholders can intentionally locate behaviours, meanwhile learning about themselves and their realities. In this context, traditional cybernetic planning seem unable to face the probabilistic and chaotic environmental phenomena, so making it extremely hard to point out elements, to schedule times, to respect consistencies. However, practical cases of experimentation of the argumentative approach to environmental planning are particularly rare. Given this starting conceptual condition, the present paper will try to contribute to the research field, dealing with the potentials using an ICT-based argumentative and communicative approach to environmental planning. In particular, a proposed process will be discussed, with reference to Future studies and to the Strategic choice approach, hybridized by information technologies. The context of such experimentation is a 5-year EU-financed project to build sustainable development futures in the Mediterranean region, ended in 2003. },

Measures of emotional expressiveness included both behavioral assessments of emotional encoding/expressiveness and self-report instruments. There were 34 effect sizes for the Extraversion-expressiveness relationship and 26 effect sizes for Neuroticism-expressiveness. The results revealed that self-report measures of emotional expressiveness yield Extraversion and Neuroticism effects that are not the same as effects provided by behavioral assessments of emotional expressiveness/encoding. However, there was a significant overall positive relationship between Extraversion and emotional expressiveness, regardless of type of expressiveness measure. Overall, Neuroticism was significantly negatively related to behavioral measures of emotional expressiveness, but unrelated to self-report measures. These results suggest that emotional expressiveness and extraversion are linked, but that self-report and behavioral measures of emotional expressiveness are not interchangeable. Nonverbal communication researchers should pay attention to both the type and scope of the instrument when selecting and using measures of emotional expressiveness. },

Combining transformative, critical mathematics and ethnomathematical perspectives we develop a critical cultural perspective on the need for a culturally contextualized mathematics education that enables Nepalese students to develop (rather than abandon) their cultural capital. We illustrate this perspective by means of an ethnodrama which portrays a pre-service teacher’s point of view of the universalist pedagogy of Dr. Euclid, a semi-fictive professor of undergraduate mathematics. We deconstruct the naivety of this conventional Western mathematics pedagogy arguing that it fails to incorporate salient aspects of Nepali culture. Subsequently we employ metaphorical imagining to envision a culturally inclusive mathematics education for enabling Nepalese teachers to (i) excavate multiple mathematical knowledge systems embedded in the daily practices of rural and remote villages across the country, and (ii) develop contextualized pedagogical perspectives to serve the diverse interests and aspirations of Nepali school children. },

  abstract={ The paper commences with an attempt to define multicultural education (also referred to as intercultural education) with reference to its historical development and current uses of the term. The rise of international schools is then addressed as a necessary preamble to a definition of international education from an historical perspective; a comparison with multicultural education sharpens the definition. The author goes on to propose that intercultural understanding is a principal, common objective of multicultural and international education and should serve to bring together scholars and practitioners in both fields whereas the literature and practice shows them, by and large, operating independently with little reference, one to the other. Greater collaboration can only be of mutual benefit in achieving common objectives and improving practice. The paper concludes with some suggestions for collaborative research across both fields. },

First, the review looks at a model of map and text learning and the factors such as prior knowledge and individual differences that affect the model. Second, the review examines how the location of features on a map has a significant effect on what is learned from the map; namely, that features located on the edge of a map are learned and remembered more often and at higher rates than those features located in the interior of the map. Next, the review looks at several ways maps can be used effectively in classrooms. The order of presentation, situated cognition, and the use of technology to improve map learning in classrooms are all discussed. Finally, the review looks at the future of learning from maps and texts. },

  abstract={ There are many forms of outdoor learning. In the UK outdoor adventures, residential centres, field studies, Forest School and play in the outdoors are all available to some extent for the three to eleven age group. Each type has distinct aims and purposes but there are however some commonalities which may point to what the special nature of the outdoors has to offer. In this paper we use a typology of values in nature to investigate some possible dimensions within this. The interplay between these characteristics and the pedagogies employed in two forms of outdoor provision is explored. We will firstly clarify our definitions of the concepts of the outdoors, outdoor learning, and pedagogy. We review literature relating to outdoor education and pedagogy. A critical discussion is informed by our recent research in Forest School and a residential outdoor education centre and will help to determine whether outdoor learning may make a unique contribution to the education of children and the methods employed by practitioners. This will help to identify areas for potential research into outdoor learning in the early years which has been thus far overlooked. },

However, many approaches are based on inappropriate assumptions about transfer, the ways in which meaning is represented by individuals and relationships among different kinds of experiences. It is advanced that the development of technology knowledge in school should aim at developing a rich inter-connectedness among the ways in which technological meanings can be understood by learners, so that learners experience transformations in relation to themselves, technological practice and their knowledge. Cultural-historical activity theory is suggested as a useful basis for designing instruction aimed at the various purposes of technology education. },

Core foundational underpinnings of the subject are explored, including its hands-on nature, its open-endedness, and its encouragement of generative cognitive processes. Issues relating to the teaching of problem solving are discussed. Examples of curricular approaches to the subject are set forth and their merits as bases for encouraging creative thinking are examined. Research on creativity in the subject is reflected upon briefly. The paper concludes by offering problem solving; and analogical, metaphorical, combination, and divergent thinking, as possible bases for pedagogy in technology education, and calls attention to the subject as a possible fruitful area of research based on creativity in the school curriculum. },

The results indicate that the effect sizes far synchronous instructor-directed DE were consistent and not significantly different from zero; in asynchronous DE, media only supporting independent learning was generally less effective than media supporting collaborative discussion among students, although both subsets were significantly heterogeneous. Follow-up analysis of asynchronous DE findings was framed in terms of three patterns of interaction—student-content, student-instructor and student-student. },

In a 2-day stay at a research institution three groups of graduating high school students from different schools, together with their chemistry teacher, were confronted hands-on with molecular modeling in industry and in university. Each of these volunteer students had agreed to write an essay on “School Chemistry Vs. Chemistry in Research.” These essays were evaluated together by the students, the teacher, and the researcher in a meeting at their school. The opinion of the students show that school chemistry does not convey today's chemistry in research and in industry. At the computer screen the students demonstrated their skill in performing molecular modeling experiments. Moreover, at the computer screen, chemistry was fun and easier to understand. Now we begin to see the solution: our students are also our teachers. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to examine students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning, epistemological beliefs, across domains that vary according to Biglan's classification of academic disciplines (hard vs. soft disciplines and pure vs. applied disciplines). One hundred and fifty-two university students completed three questionnaires that assessed their epistemological beliefs about mathematics (hard-pure), the social sciences (also pure), and business (neither hard nor pure). Correlations indicated that students' epistemological beliefs were similar for mathematics and social sciences, as well as for mathematics and business. When the amount of academic experience was taken into account, some evidence of domain specificity was found. These results support Sternberg's caveat that the dichotomy of domain generality/specificity is an assumption that should be questioned. We propose that future researchers should investigate the breadth of applicability of epistemological beliefs. },

This article traces the nature of students' conceptions for the solution process of table salt. The findings of this study indicate that a hypermedia environment can be used to explore, negotiate, and assess students' conceptions of the submicroscopic aspects of solution chemistry. Further, this article discusses the successes and difficulties pertaining to the learning of solution chemistry in a hypermedia environment, and presents an account of an improved version for future study. },

This discussion is based on the almost 10 years of experience delivering Integrative Science to students at Cape Breton University. Integrative Science is the interface between Indigenous Sciences (at Cape Breton University guided by eastern Canadian Mi’kmaq traditions) and Western Sciences where one does not have to relinquish either position but can come to understand elements of both. Western scientists seek to understand how the Universe works. The basic premise of Indigenous Sciences is participating within nature’s relationships, not necessarily deciphering how they work. The Two-Eyed Seeing approach used in Integrative Science seeks to avoid knowledge domination and assimilation by recognizing the best from both worlds. Integrative Science in the classroom relies on a holistic transdisciplinary curriculum firmly based in place. Crucial elements include a colearning philosophy, connection with culture and community, a psychologically safe classroom, and Aboriginal pedagogy. },

  abstract={ Globalization has increased economic competition within and between countries and the world’s regions. Economic competitiveness is commonly seen as a valid index for judging a country’s level of economic prosperity. Many recent large-scale education reforms have been justified by the urgent need to increase labor productivity and promote economic development and growth through expanded and improved education. It is generally assumed that to increase economic competitiveness, citizens must acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for civic success and the knowledge-based economy. This article argues that what schools are expected to do in order to promote economic competitiveness often contradicts commonly accepted global education reform thinking. Experience in many countries indicates that increased standardization of teaching and learning, for example, may be counterproductive to the expectations of enhanced economic competitiveness. The conclusion is that rather than competition between education systems, schools and students, what is needed is networking, deeper co-operation and open sharing of ideas at all levels if the role of education in economic competitiveness is to be strengthened. The key features of education reform policies that are compatible with competitiveness are those that encourage flexibility in education systems, creativity in schools and risk-taking without fear on the part of individuals. },

We suggest that trivialized versions of constructivism continue to be promulgated due, in large part,to misunderstandings of some of the vocabulary adopted by its advocates. This situation has been the source of considerable frustration in our ongoing efforts to communicate the insights and implications of radical and social constructivist theories to preservice and practicing teachers. We discuss some of the specifics of these frustrations along with strategies intended to flag and circumvent them in our work with teachers. The writing is structured around a set of recursively elaborated interpretations of a classroom episode. Developed around varied understandings of the terms ‘structure’ and ‘construct’, these interpretations are intended to show how we have worked with teachers to foster a deep appreciation of how learning might be reframed as dependent on, rather than determined by, teaching. },

  abstract={ Within a European context, facilitating the increased participation of marginalized groups within society has become a cornerstone of social policy. In higher education in Ireland this has generally involved the targeting for support of individuals representing groups traditionally excluded on the grounds of socio-economic status. More recently, people with disability have been included in this consideration. This approach has tended to focus on physical access issues and some technical supports. However, access is multi-faceted and must include a review of pedagogic practices, assistive provision (technological and personal), student’s engagement with their workload (e.g. recording) and evaluation procedures: achieving accreditation levels commensurate with ability. This small-scale Irish study examined the experiences of two groups of young people with physical disabilities and with dyslexia in two higher education institutions. It was apparent that for students with physical disabilities and with dyslexia, assessment practices were fraught with additional limitations. Assessment practices were mediated for these students through the physical environment, the backwash effect of assessment on curriculum, the availability and use of assistive technology, and through the attitudes of staff and students. It can be concluded that access issues within higher education have been inadequately conceptualized and as a result failed to address fundamental issues around assessment for students with physical disabilities and with dyslexia. },

The major thrust of the paper is the consideration of what has caused me to remain so involved in teacher research, how can teachers generate knowledge of value and how can teachers disseminate this knowledge. The motivation for the initial preparation of this paper was to present my thinking about these issues at the conference of the American Educational Research Association. As a classroom teacher invited to speak on an international stage it is tempting to view the paper as something of a culmination, but in fact it is equally a launching pad for further enhancement and development of what has become an exciting and engaging project. },

How teachers measure student progress and define mastery rarely receive attention.

One such discovery, performance standards, has demonstrated that students can retain skills over significant amounts of time, perform at high rates with little performance decrement, and apply “element” skills to more sophisticated “compound” skills. Performance standards discovered by Precision Teachers allow a behavioral determination of fluency, or mastery. The recognition of Precision Teaching methods and results in regard to measuring behavior and determining mastery contributes to one of the most significant social issues in American society, education.

  abstract={ The phenomenal growth of information technology and globalization promises a future where education about diversity and difference will be very significant. In this information age where existing knowledge and technology are constantly being replaced in an ever changing interdependent global environment, the fundamentals of education are also changing. Education will focus on building new knowledge rather than passing on existing knowledge. The increasing interconnectedness between cultures and their concomitant intermixing as a result of globalization requires that pedagogies about cultural diversity also focus on creating new knowledge and meanings about cultures as they change. In this article, we discuss sociocultural theory as an alternative educational pedagogy that situates the teaching and learning of cultural diversity within rapidly changing local and global conditions. We argue that features of this theory are especially relevant to providing a guiding pedagogy for valuing difference in inclusive environments. We engage the literature on cross-cultural communication and collaboration between culturally diverse professionals and parents of children with disabilities to illustrate sociocultural perspectives on conceptualizing cultural differences and their interaction, and the possibilities for creating culturally inclusive partnerships and communities. },

We discuss data from a 5&nbsp;year longitudinal study and critique our own assumptions as we develop portraits of schools that are both situated and complex. We do this to explore the question: In what ways does educational reform actually change educational practice? We develop a framework that articulates a critique of bureaucracy from the standpoint of caring, locate the culture of each school within the theoretical framework, and analyze how the culture of schools affects the implementation of educational reform. We conclude that reform is deeply cultural and that ethnographic methods are essential to understanding educational reform efforts. },

The theoretical framework was derived from consideration of informal learning, and more specifically experiential learning, drawing on prior research undertaken in the context of school gardening. The research approach is characterised by the use of concept maps to uncover the characteristically different ways in which children discerned school gardening and to help to provide insight into their understanding of this activity. It was supported by contextual observation, interviews and children’s drawings to aid the interpretation and understanding. The study showed a positive impact on learning and on the perceptions of children towards school gardening in all three countries. It also highlighted the different perceptions, interpretations and understanding of school gardening in the different cultures and environments, as well as the various aspects of it which the children themselves highlighted. },

This study documents the affects of various policies that were implemented to create equity and equality in urban, multi-racial and socio-economically diverse classrooms. These reforms were created due to a court desegregation order that demanded the district take multiple steps to raise the academic achievement levels of students of color in the district. Using the lens of Critical Race Theory to examine issues of interest-convergence and the effects of court-ordered desegregation initiatives, the researcher documents how teachers have come to terms with two major curricular changes that work in conjunction with other curricular reforms. Research that considers the affects of large-scale policy initiatives on classroom practices is necessary to further current conversations on successful reform implementation. },

  abstract={ The core purpose of this paper is to describe a new educational paradigm as well as possible directions and tasks for education reform in the 21st century. The present-day education system has failed to nurture the kind of creative people who can play leading roles in development or to produce citizens of a good character and democratic tendencies. We need to look at education from the standpoint of expanding the totality of possibilities for national development. The current educational system of Korea can be characterized as one of “manpower-centered education. ” In this system, education functions to produce the human resources needed by the nation, and there is a strong belief in the classification and selection of high-quality human capital via the school system. We can think of an educational model that is parallel to the current system of manpower classification and selection and call it “competency-based education. ” In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be the most important, and the key task of education is self-actualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities. What educational values should be pursued within a new competency-based paradigm? First, we can reduce the relative weight of subject-centered education and introduce a competency-based curriculum in order to teach key competences for life. Second, new intelligence theories must be introduced into education in order to foster the development of students' talents, aptitudes, and potentials. Third, we can make use of positive psychology, which is a newly emerging field, the core concept of which is the belief that happiness in life depends on one's ability to develop and maintain positive feelings and emotions. },

  abstract={ This article argues that there are distinct spheres of justice within education and examines a range of justice norms and distribution rules that characterize the daily life of schools and classrooms. Moving from the macro to micro level, we identify the following five areas: the right to education, the allocation of (or selection into) learning places, teaching–learning practices, teachers’ treatment of students, and student evaluations of grade distribution. We discuss the literature on the beliefs by students and teachers about the just distribution of educational goods in these five domains, and on the practices used in the actual allocation of these goods. In line with normative ‘spheres of justice’ arguments in social theory, we conclude that the ideals of social justice within schools vary strongly according to the particular resource to be distributed. Moreover, these ideals often do not correspond with the practices that actually guide resource distribution in education, which may go some way toward explaining explicit or latent conflicts in this sphere. },

For this purpose a sample of 12 schools in Mumbai was used. Ten children from Grade IV were identified from each school, five with learning problems (teacher identified) and five without problems (randomly selected from the attendance register). Observations through videotaping the teacher’s interactions with children especially with those the teacher identified as having learning problems were done. The learning problems were also checked with the help of Behavioral Checklist for Screening Learning Disabilities and Diagnostic Test for Learning Disabilities and interview of teachers. Results indicated that that both the tests as well as teachers emerged as fair predictors of the problem. The implications of the findings for teacher training needs with reference to handling learning problems in the classroom have been drawn. },

The paper begins by considering the imperative for schools and individuals to be enterprising. It then moves on to examine more closely the impact of this discursive shift on teachers, students and school communities as they engage in enterprising practices. We draw on our research of over 50 state and private schools mainly in south-east Queensland to demonstrate how the newly emergent corporate ‘curriculum’ is producing a changing set of imperatives, responsibilities and outcomes for leadership in ‘enterprising’ schools. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to investigate whether participation in sensorimotor activities by preschool children involving their own bodily balance while walking on a beam over the floor has an effect on their understanding of the mechanical equilibrium of a balance beam. The balance beam consisted of a horizontal stick balancing around its center of mass (middle point), while carrying equal-weight objects on either side of it. The study utilized a two-group design, and was conducted in three phases (pre-test, treatment and post-test). The results of the study provide evidence that there was such an effect, since the children (who participated in the sensorimotor activities) could select out of a number of objects those two with the same weight regardless of their shape, size or colour, in order to balance the stick. This effect also can be seen when a comparison is made with a second group of children, which had previously participated in a hands-on activity regarding the equilibrium of a similar balance beam, and which (children), therefore, had a definite advantage over the other children who had participated in the sensorimotor activity. A Chi Square Test showed no significant differences between the two groups on both an immediate and a delayed post-test, while the McNemar Test for the Significance of Change showed a statistically significant difference (that is, a negative change in performance between the first and the second post-test) only within the hands-on group. This difference represents evidence that the children from the sensorimotor group remembered better the rule they were applying (i.e., selecting equal-weight objects) in order to balance the beam. },

Initially, 20 teachers were surveyed about their planning and usage of different representational modes. These teachers tended to focus on resources and students’ learning styles rather than modal variation, sometimes confusing modes and resources. Few teachers expected students to be able to represent the same concept in different modes as part of understanding science. In this article we report in detail the beliefs and practices of two elementary teachers in the survey who focused on the value of representational diversity in learning science. In analyzing their beliefs and practices we identified some key implementation issues in pursuing this multimodal focus. },

For most students, school science is like being chained inside Plato's cave, only able to experience and interpret the world of science from flickering, shadowy images. This can be particularly problematic for students in elementary schools, who may not be developmentally ready for abstract topics inherent to nature of science discussions and whose teachers tend to have low science self-efficacy beliefs. In the mainly qualitative ethnographic study of a 3-year, large-scale collaborative action research project reported here, a significant additional factor limiting students' access to more contemporary views about and realistic experiences with science, however, was government curriculum policy—which promotes highly idealized portrayals of and regulated experiences with science. Data and arguments for these claims are provided. },

  abstract={ Modern personalized information systems have been proven to support the user with information at the appropriate level and in the appropriate form. In specific environments like museums and exhibitions, focusing on the control of such a system is contradictory to establishing a relationship with the artifacts and exhibits. Preferably, the technology becomes invisible to the user and the physical reality becomes the interface to an additional virtual layer: by naturally moving in the space and/or manipulating physical objects in our surroundings the user will access information and operate the virtual layer. The LISTEN project is an attempt to make use of the inherent “everyday” integration of aural and visual perception, developing a tailored, immersive audio-augmented environment for the visitors of art exhibitions. The challenge of the LISTEN project is to provide a personalized immersive augmented environment, an aim which goes beyond the guiding purpose. The visitors of the museum implicitly interact with the system because the audio presentation is adapted to the users’ contexts (e.g. interests, preferences, motion, etc.), providing an intelligent audio-based environment. This article describes the realization and user evaluation of the LISTEN system focusing on the personalization component. As this system has been installed at the Kunstmuseum Bonn in the context of an exhibition comprising artworks of the painter August Macke, a detailed evaluation could be conducted. },

  abstract={ Despite the huge investments in the last two decades in the introduction of ICT to education and the grandiose expectations accompanying them, ICT has not been widely integrated into educational systems throughout the post-industrial world; furthermore, there is no clear evidence that ICT leads to the improvement of students' outcomes, enhances desired modes of learning or teaching of desired social values. Indeed, on the basis of the outcomes realized to date, one could characterize the rapid and costly response of Western educational systems to the ICT revolution as “much ado about nothing”. This paper focuses on the two questions stemming from awareness of this state of affairs: • Why have so few outcomes resulted from the huge investments in ICT? • What must happen in order for educational systems to successfully adapt to the ICT revolution? In contrast to some recent writers on this issue who have criticized the rush to computerization of education, this paper argues that educational systems cannot abstain from joining the ICT race. Abstention is not really an option since the ICT revolution is an important aspect of a deeper and broader cultural revolution that is changing Western culture from modern (or, industrial) to postmodern (or post-industrial) and schools, if they want to survive, have no option but to adapt themselves to the era in which they function. However, successful adaptation requires: 1. a radical breaking of the organizational “glass ceiling” (i.e. school's modern organizational structure) now preventing the true adaptation of education to postmodernity, 2. the accompaniment of this radical restructuring by a well-formed strategy based on a clear understanding of the new emerging culture and explicit values and educational aims. The paper argues that currently, computerization processes in post-industrial societies suffer acutely from total ignorance of the need for such radical organizational restructuring and for its accompaniment by a cultural-ideological strategy – hence the explanation to the above “much a do about nothing” phenomenon. },

After outlining the life phase of mating games – their emergence, rise, maturation, and possible eventual decline – we go on to argue that participation in these games (in each phase) does make sense from an adaptationist point of view. The strong version of our theory which proposes that all cultural practices are, or once were, mating games, allows us to derive a set of testable predictions for the fields of archaeology, economics, and psychology. },

I use a combination of techniques from human performance technology and Sensemaking® to gather and analyze data from potential users. The resultant tag set is simple enough that researchers may envision a performance support system where users may quickly and easily tag and add objects to the system. This opens the door to the creation of systems designed for groups with homogenous information needs, with unique metatags, populated largely with objects and information brought into the system by the users. },

Learning experiences were designed for students to invoke the Recognition, Strategic, and Affective neural networks for learning identified in the CAST research. Instruction was based on the Science Education content standard that all students should develop an understanding of the characteristics, life cycles, and environments of living organisms. Teachers designed interdisciplinary projects for students with the metamorphosis of the butterfly as the theme the unit. Participants from nine states and four countries learned about UDL to transform teaching and to collaborate through a blog that supported their learning. They shared new technology applications for use in their projects. The learning that occurred and the excitement to use technology for learning clearly demonstrate the power of the UDL framework for increasing engagement and understanding by all learners. },

Various sources of data—including quantitative pre- and postmeasures of spatial visualization and spatial orientation tests and achievement scores on six measures and qualitative unstructured observations, interviews, and field trip notes—were utilized to document the abilities and learning of 27 university students. Results indicated that (a) some students had initial difficulty with certain visual concepts, such as 3D crystal models, symmetry elements, mirror symmetry, rotation, inversion, and combination of symmetry elements while they were learning about mineralogy; (b) learning about mineralogy and spatial ability are two interrelated components; while the mineralogy course improved students’ spatial ability, their existing spatial abilities had a strong influence on facilitating mineralogy learning; and (c) spatial visualization skill is a better predictor of mineralogy achievement than spatial orientation skill. While the discussions highlighted the role of visuospatial thinking in learning about mineralogy, it is argued that researchers and curriculum developers should focus on the productive role of visuospatial thinking in learning about science. },

  abstract={ Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known method for imparting thinking competencies and creating flexible learning environments. Advancing low-achieving pupils is an on-going challenge for educational systems. Routing low-achievers into low-learning tracks creates a vicious circle. In order to extract pupils and their teachers from the on-going cycle of failure, and to promote pupils cognitively and emotionally, four steps were taken: defining significant goals for the pupils as well as for the teachers, changing the learning environment, carrying out original projects taking advantage of the pupils' special skills and abilities, and changing assessment methods for project-based learning activities in a computerized environment. This paper presents a continuous field research that has used qualitative and quantitative tools for exploring pupils' progress in the affective and the cognitive domains. The research tools were: Analysis of pupils' portfolios, observations of class activities, interviews with pupils, teachers and school management, achievements in the matriculation examinations, and assessment of pupils' projects. The findings indicate that scientific-technological PBL elevated pupils' motivation and self-image at all levels and achieved significant affective learning. The activities over three years are summarized and show an increase in the number of students achieving the college admittance requirements. Most of the low-achieving pupils succeeded with distinction in the same matriculation exams that the high-achievers did in the same school. },

  abstract={ A framework, termed the RSP, is proposed. It is mainly for analyzing and explaining how learning occurs. This framework is grounded in the social-cultural perspective, in particular, in the thinking of both Vygotsky and Popper. Although the thinking of Popper is generally not referred to as having a social-cultural orientation, mostly due to misunderstanding, he and Vygotsky are defensibly complementary. In a nutshell, Vygotsky’s social-cultural (inter-psychological) plane is enriched by Popper’s distinction between physical and conceptual-abstract worlds, while Popper’s mental world is enhanced by Vygotskian and post-Vygotskian work emphasizing personality, that is, the whole self. Integrating and expanding on both Vygotsky and Popper, the RSP framework further unpacks how learning occurs as dialectical interactions between the Worlds of reifications (R), selves (S), and phenomena (P). The World of Reifications (R) extends Popper’s World 3 by emphasizing the developmental nature of conjectures to theories. The World of Selves (S) now extends Popper’s World 2 from cognitive dimensions to the whole individual. And the World of Phenomena (P) extends Popper’s World 1 to include the relationships between objects forming phenomena, including the physical, social, and spiritual dimensions. The interactions among the three Worlds result in five learning outcomes: cognition, metacognition, action, reflective action, and epistemic cognition. It is contended that these five outcomes are necessary criteria for holistic learning. The framework is then applied to analyzing various issues such as resolving lethal mutations, identity, and learning as becoming. },

  abstract={ The call for reforms in science education has been ongoing for a century, with new movements and approaches continuously reshaping the identity and values of the discipline. The HPS movement has an equally long history and taken part in the debates defining its purpose and revising curriculum. Its limited success, however, is due not only to competition with alternative visions and paradigms (e.g. STS, multi-culturalism, constructivism, traditionalism) which deadlock implementation, and which have led to conflicting meanings of scientific literacy, but the inability to rise above the debate. At issue is a fundamental problem plaguing science education at the school level, one it shares with education in general. It is my contention that it requires a guiding “metatheory” of education that can appropriately distance itself from the dual dependencies of metatheories in psychology and the demands of socialization—especially as articulated in most common conceptions of scientific literacy tied to citizenship. I offer as a suggestion Egan’s cultural-linguistic theory as a metatheory to help resolve the impasse. I hope to make reformers familiar with his important ideas in general and more specifically, to show how they can complement HPS rationales and reinforce the work of those researchers who have emphasized the value of narrative in learning science. This will be elaborated in Part II of a supplemental paper to the present one. As a prerequisite to presenting Egan’s metatheory I first raise the issue of the need for a conceptual shift back to philosophy of education within the discipline, and thereto, on developing and demarcating true educational theories (essentially neglected since Hirst). In the same vein it is suggested a new research field should be opened with the express purpose of developing a discipline-specific “philosophy of science education” (largely neglected since Dewey) which could in addition serve to reinforce science education’s growing sense of academic autonomy and independence from socio-economic demands. },

The first phase of the project was a study conducted with both primary and secondary technology pre-service teacher education students in a number of different countries who were given the same teacher-knowledge graphical framework as a tool to support reflection on their professional knowledge. We discovered that, despite the different country contexts, student teachers of technology could articulate aspects of their developing teacher knowledge using the same framework for teacher professional development. As previously reported in this journal (Banks et&nbsp;al. International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 14, 141–157, 2004), the common graphical tool enabled them to set out their subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and ‘school’ knowledge and was useful in helping them become more self-aware. In this second phase of the project we have developed this line of research in two ways. First, we extended the range of participants to include experienced teachers involved in in-service work connected to curriculum development. Second, we looked at the inter-relationship for pre-service teachers between their developing professional knowledge and their own ‘personal subject construct’. In this article, the theoretical framework for the subsequent papers is described and set in the context of recent debates surrounding the nature and importance of teacher knowledge; and the way such professional knowledge can be articulated by teachers. },

The research reported is based on the developing relationship between principals and teacher leaders as they collaboratively engage in a process of whole school improvement. Both case study schools used the IDEAS school improvement program which originates from the Leadership Research Institute, University of Southern Queensland. The cases trace the facilitation of the IDEAS process in each school and highlights the centrality of teacher leadership in bringing about change in school-wide pedagogy and a process of school re-culturing. It underlines the fact that principals need to support the enabling of leadership among teachers by giving them the space, time and responsibility to make decisions about curriculum work and ensuring that these are aligned with new organizational structures and processes. The paper discusses how the schools were different and yet similar in many ways between the two countries, Singapore and Australia, with regard to the nature of the enabling processes for organizational revitalization and school capacity building. It draws out some implications for school leadership and school improvement. },

  abstract={ After a presentation of the French school system, we describe how the three principal practices—acceleration, enrichment, and special classes—for the education of the gifted are functioning in France. Then, we deal with the counselling of the gifted through 1) the presentation of the professional involved in these tasks, 2) the role played by the parent associations of gifted children, and 3) the identification practices. For the talented, there are many practices, from primary education onwards, which allow schooling to be reconciled with sports studies or artistic tuition. The concept of “dual project” is introduced: the need for sportsmen/women to elaborate their career plan at the same time as their sporting project. The conclusion stresses that in France, measures for the gifted are not clearly laid out; whereas, provisions benefiting from clear and explicit information have been made for the talented and are encouraged by various institutions. },

  abstract={ In 1983, after over 10&nbsp;years of working on mathematics education reform in the Philippines, I wrote a paper for a Tokyo conference arguing that education reform in developing countries such as the Philippines should begin by working on macro-problems, namely the social, political, and economic environment of the schools, as a context for the micro-problems, the usual concerns of curriculum, teacher training, textbooks, and so forth. This article recounts how we carried out this approach to education reform in three large-scale initiatives: the Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP), the Synergeia Foundation, and the Ateneo Center for Educational Development. The TEEP is an education project for the 23 poorest provinces in the Philippines, which began in the mid-1990s and was carried out fully from 2000 to 2006. The Synergeia Foundation, Inc. and the Ateneo Center for Educational Development are organizations which have been working with elementary schools on the scale of whole towns, cities, and provinces. They are also now beginning their work with high schools. What these initiatives have in common is that they begin by engaging the community, the school superintendents and supervisors, principals, teachers, parents, and political and civic leaders. A process is followed to have them focus on the realities of their schools, develop consensus on strategic plans and priorities, and participate in the process of achieving goals. Implementation then focuses on what we call targeted interventions, such as teacher training, educational materials, and physical facilities, which address the agreed-on priorities. The evaluation of the Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP) at its end in 2006 shows that the approach leads to major improvement on a large scale. We are seeing the same kind of results in the work of Synergeia Foundation, Inc. and the Ateneo Center for Educational Development. },

  abstract={ Future elementary school teachers often lack self-efficacy for teaching science and technology. They are particularly anxious about encouraging children to carry-out student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry and/or technological design projects. Moreover, because this often also is the case with practising elementary school teachers, it is difficult for student–teachers to gain practical experience facilitating student-led project work during practicum sessions. To provide student–teachers with expertise and motivation for promoting student-directed, open-ended project work, therefore, a group of future elementary teachers were taken through a constructivism-informed ‘apprenticeship’ during their university-based teaching methods course and then invited to make project work the subject of the action research that they were required to complete during their practicum. In this paper, successes that one student–teacher (out of 78 studied) experienced in promoting student-directed, open-ended technological design projects are reported. Although she judged children’s designs to be modestly successful, data indicate that her self-efficacy for promoting project work increased significantly. Analyses of qualitative data collected during the methods course and practicum also indicate that aspects of the curriculum, teachers, students and milieu appeared to contribute to this success. Such findings suggest that teacher educators should focus on helping future elementary teachers to develop expertise and motivation that would enable and encourage children to conduct technological design projects before conducting scientific inquiries. Such a tack may be the most pragmatic—and, arguably, epistemologically-sound—approach for helping ‘science- and technology-phobic’ student–teachers to move from the periphery to the core of practices in science and technology education. },

Two hundreds and fifty four 8th graders were involved in experimental group, this group of students experienced inquiry instruction. Two hundreds and thirty two 8th graders were involved in control group, they were taught by traditional science teaching. Students' motivation toward science learning questionnaire (SMTSL) (Tuan, Chin &amp; Shieh, 2005) were implemented in both groups in the beginning and at the end of the study. Students in the experimental group filled out learning preference questionnaire (Lumsdaine &amp; Lumsdaine, 1995) in the beginning of the study. Forty students which represent different learning styles were chosen from five experimental classes to conduct post-test interview. Paired t-test, MANOVA, analytic inductive methods were used for analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data. Findings indicated that after inquiry instruction students' motivation increased significantly (p&lt;.001) than students who enrolled in traditional teaching. Four different learning styles of students increased significantly (p&lt;.005) in SMTSL scales: self-efficacy, active learning strategies, science learning value, performance goal and achievement goal. No significant difference was found among four learning styles of students' motivation after inquiry teaching. Interview data supported that most of students with different learning styles were willing to participate in the inquiry learning activities, while they hold different reasons for their engagement. Findings confirm inquiry-based science teaching can motivate students with different learning styles in science learning. },

  abstract={ The objective of this research project is to develop, test, validate, and demonstrate an analytical framework for assessing regional-scale forest disturbance in the mid-Atlantic region by linking forest disturbance and forest nitrogen export to surface waters at multiple spatial scales. It is hypothesized that excessive nitrogen (N) leakage (export) from forested watersheds is a potentially useful, integrative "indicator" of a negative change in forest function which occurs in synchrony with changes in forest structure and species composition. Our research focuses mainly on forest disturbance associated with recent defoliations by the gypsy moth larva (Lymantria dispar) at spatial scales ranging from small watersheds to the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. An approach for assessing the magnitude of forest disturbance and its impact on surface water quality will be based on an empirical model relating forest N leakage and gypsy moth defoliation that will be calibrated using data from 25 intensively-monitored forested watersheds in the region and tested using data from more than 60 other forested watersheds in Virginia. Ultimately, the model will be extended to the region using spatially-extensive data describing: 1) the spatial distribution of dominant forest types in the mid-Atlantic region based on both remote sensing imagery and plot-scale vegetation data; 2) the spatial pattern of gypsy moth defoliation of forested areas from aerial mapping; and 3) measurements of dissolved N concentrations in streams from synoptic water quality surveys. },

First, we elaborate on the core elements of the process of reculturing, referring to a complex learning process of finding a new balance between cognitions and emotions both individually and collectively. We then review the literature for issues related to school leaders’ roles and actions during reculturing. We argue that the role of leadership power largely has been left out of the picture so far while at the same time leadership power is so crucial for teachers’ roles and actions in educational innovation processes. To illustrate our line of thinking, we analyse the stories of three school leaders about their roles and actions during successful processes of reculturing and retrospectively analyse the role of leadership power during these processes, building on a framework of Hetebrij (2006) for judging the quality of power use. },

  abstract={ In this paper I discuss issues concerning pedagogical practice and inquiry in Outdoor Education raised by recognition that the human body inhabits a ‘technological lifeworld’. The intent is to challenge certain assumptions regarding interpretations of ‘experience’, the ‘environment’ and ‘the body’ in Outdoor Education practice. The theory and practice of Outdoor Education recognises that knowing becomes embodied through action. This process is often aided by pre-action focussing and post-action reflection. I argue that the stated educational goals of many Outdoor Education programs are made vulnerable due to the ‘hidden work’ of technologies encountered and inattention to the significance of technology in experience. The approach employed in this paper is to relate a brief overview of philosophical inquiry into technology and the body to the discussion of two exhibits (a spoon and a three-legged stool), both objects crafted by secondary school students as a part of their outdoor and environmental education. I conclude that human and environmental well being cannot be separated in the ‘technological lifeworld’ that humans are destined to inhabit, and that Outdoor Education must sustain a broad range of technologically mediated experiences of the environment through, with and in the body. },

Differentiation among learners can be undertaken in a growing number of ways and the range of approaches to teaching is expanding. The act of matching cannot have a simple rationale because learners in any one class may be sufficiently diverse that it requires awareness and subtlety to meet their many and various needs. Nor can there be an easy approach to the alignment of curricular goals to learning outcomes: Any one approach to teaching can meet a range of goals and generate numerous outcomes. The need is for an orchestrated approach, which involves knowing and understanding particular groups of learners and appreciating the spectrum of congruent approaches to supporting their learning. The metaphor of the orchestrating learning and teaching is explored for its range of convenience. },

  abstract={ Drawing on Charles Peirce’s descriptions of his correspondence course on the “Art of Reasoning,” I argue that Peirce believed that the study of logic stands at the center of a liberal arts education. However, Peirce’s notion of logic included much more than the traditional accounts of deduction and syllogistic reasoning. He believed that the art of reasoning required a study of both abductive and inductive inference as well the practice of observation and imagination. Employing these other features of logic, his course foreshadowed a number of developments in twentieth century educational theory: the belief that non-traditional students should be educated, the claim that the art of reasoning (or critical reasoning) was important to all theoretical practices, and that the art of reasoning was important to the overall growth of a person. The upshot is that Peirce’s course in the art of reasoning should make us reconsider making logic courses, under Peirce’s broad conception of logic, required courses in high school and higher education. },

Children who tended to think fast and to examine details of objects had significantly higher scores. Also, the working mothers aimed to give opportunities to their children more often than non-working mothers. The mothers whose children received preschool education tended to give more opportunities to their children to think intuitionally and to make estimations. When incorrect intuitional answers or estimations were made by children, lower-educated mothers tended to scold their children much more than higher educated mothers.

  abstract={ Holistic education is a popular trend in the midst of various educational reforms, yet little systematic research has been done to consider its application in the teaching of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and English as a Second Language (ESL) for Asian Chinese learners. According to the New Zealand Ministry of Education, holistic education is defined as an approach to teaching to include the physical, social, emotional, cultural, and cognitive dimensions of a person’s growth. Education reform in Taiwan has adopted a Western constructivist approach. However, in Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC), open teacher–student and student–student interactions are not as common as they are in the social constructivist model found in the Anglo-Saxon culture. CHC values social harmony, teachers’ authority, and silence to avoid confrontation. Without understanding the affective and social environment in the Western context, holistic education is unlikely to be successfully implemented in Taiwan. The purpose of this research is to understand the contextualization of the holistic environment and pedagogical strategies that nurture student–teacher and student–student interactions in a holistic approach to EFL. This study utilized qualitative research methods of observation and in-depth interviews of New Zealand English teachers and observed the pedagogical practices in New Zealand English classes. This research provided effective pedagogical strategies for implementing the social and affective support of a holistic educational approach for Asian EFL students. },

Das Gardner-Fibrom ist bei Kindern und jungen Erwachsenen als Indikatorläsion für eine bislang nicht erkannte familiäre Adenomatosis Polyposis coli (FAP) bzw. ein Gardner-Syndrom, für familiäre Desmoidfibromatosen bei Fehlen weiterer APC-Zeichen oder als Hinweis auf eine neue APC-Mutation zu bewerten. Diese Diagnose sollte daher durch den Pathologen mit einem entsprechenden Hinweis an den klinisch tätigen Arzt weitergegeben werden. Als Konsequenz ist bei Nachweis einer APC-Mutation ein kontinuierliches Follow-up der jungen Patienten hinsichtlich der Entwicklung kolorektaler Tumoren und aggressiver Fibromatosen sowie eine Familienuntersuchung auf eine FAP anzuraten. },

  abstract={ Turkey is still far from realizing any of the six EFA goals. Since the Dakar Conference there have been many policy initiatives aiming at improving the quality of Turkish education. The impact and effectiveness of those policy initiatives are yet to be evaluated. The deficit of high quality analytical and empirical research constitutes a major weakness. So does the level of attention on monitoring and evaluation from policymakers. The recent introduction of strategic planning and performance-based budgeting could promote more emphasis on evaluation and monitoring in the coming years. In addition, a transparent, overarching education policy could foster policy dialogue among stakeholders. Overall, this article draws attention to the following critical factors for the EFA success in Turkey: political and economic support for education reform; the need to adopt strategy-oriented sector policies; increased capacity and emphasis on evaluation and accountability of educational policy-making; the need for a new national impetus to improve quality in education. },

  abstract={ Surviving the aftermaths of the Asian Financial Crisis and SARS in 2003, Hong Kong’s economy has re-gained its momentum and its economic growth has been quite remarkable too in recent few years. Nevertheless, as reflected by the Social Development Index (SDI), economic growth in Hong Kong does not seem to have benefited the people of the city at large as we see social qualities such as cohesion, security, equity, and empowerment are gradually eroded. This paper aims to summarize the current state of social development in Hong Kong based on the SDI-2008 and identify the major social, political and economic challenges that are confronted by Hong Kong. Based on the findings, a range of policy options proposed for promoting a more balanced approach to social and economic development are discussed. The article illustrates the utility of social indicators research such as the SDI in assessing quality of life and assisting related social planning initiatives in Asian communities such as Hong Kong. },

  abstract={ The present study hypothesizes that both organizational and classroom constraints mediate the chance of making instructional changes sustainable. Behind this hypothesis is an assumption that when people faces impending changes, the level of anxiety tends to increase and creates defenses which block the change. A survey of 1,876 teachers in 65 secondary schools in Hong Kong is conducted and path analysis is employed to look at how constraints in the organization and in the classroom hamper the sustainable implementation of new modes of pedagogy toward constructivism. Findings in the study suggest that both organizational constraints and behavioral problems in the classroom reduce the sustainability of new modes of individual-focused and whole class focused instructional practices, but learning problems in the classroom increase the sustainability of alternative modes of individual-focused instructional practices. The author suggests that the sufficient conditions for sustainable instructional changes within a school are an authentic professional learning community among the teachers, and whole school arrangements to provide a peaceful learning environment in the classrooms and an individualized education program for students in need. },

Inclusive teaching practice, if adopted across the sector, would ensure that the needs of students with disabilities are considered and provided for, before they even arrive on campus. This paper sets out the background and key findings from an institutional research project at a UK university that aimed to discover if academic staff’s attitudes would be problematic or conducive to the implementation of inclusive teaching practice. The paper concludes that there is little evidence of widespread “resistance” but rather, the research discovered a prevailing belief in the rights of students with disabilities to education, albeit a belief which is limited in its practical application in the classroom. The paper also reports on a number of recommendations made to the case study university as a result of this research. },

  abstract={ There is no generally accepted scientific theory for the etiology of idiopathic scoliosis, and treatment is pragmatic and unrelated to such knowledge. As part of its mission to widen understanding of scoliosis etiology, the International Federated Body on Scoliosis Etiology (IBSE) introduced the electronic focus group (EFG) as a means of increasing debate of extant knowledge on important topics. This has been designated as an on-line Delphi discussion, and has proven very successful. The text for this EFG was written by Professor Sevastik and drawn from the extensive research carried out by himself and his co-workers. The thoracospinal concept of etiopathogenesis applies only to girls with right thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (Rcx-T-AIS-F). According to this concept, increased longitudinal growth of the left periapical ribs triggers the thoracic curve simultaneously in the three cardinal planes. The concept does not deal with factors involved in curve progression. Sevastik advocates mini-invasive operations on the ribs as a treatment for early progressive thoracic curves. Areas of controversy include whether or not there is overgrowth of the left periapical ribs in Rcx-T-AIS-F, and the question of whether there should be a clinical trial of mini-invasive operations on the ribs. },

  abstract={ Background: All licensed medicines in the European Union must be provided with a Patient Information Leaflet that includes a list of all known side effects. Among patients who read the leaflet, the side effects section is the most often read. A UK government regulatory publication recommends providing medicine side effect risk information in a combined format, using verbal descriptors accompanied by numerical information. Objectives: This study, with users of an existing popular patient information website, investigates the effectiveness of presenting medicine side effect risk information in different forms. Design: Participants were randomly allocated to one of the three formats for representing risk information (verbal descriptors, e.g. ‘common’; absolute frequencies, e.g. ‘less than 1 in 10 people’; and a combination of verbal descriptors and frequency bands, e.g. ‘common (affects less than 1 in 10 people)’. Methods: Participants (n= 187) were recruited from users of the Cancer Research UK patient information website. They were asked to imagine that they had to take a cancer treatment (tamoxifen), estimate the risks of four side effects occurring, and complete Likert scales relating to their satisfaction with the information supplied and perceived likelihood of various outcomes. Results: Those in the absolute frequency format demonstrated greater accuracy in estimating the likelihood of having two of four side effects than the other two formats. They were also more accurate at estimating the likelihood of themselves or the average person having any side effect from taking tamoxifen. Participants in the absolute frequency format rated the risk to health from tamoxifen as lower than those in the other two formats, were more satisfied with the information they received than those in the verbal format, and felt there would be less impact of the information on tamoxifen use than those in the combined format. Conclusions: These findings fail to confirm that the recommended use of combined descriptors for medicine side effects is unequivocally superior to absolute frequency alone. They also add weight to the growing body of research highlighting the deficiencies in using verbal descriptors for conveying side effect risk, and the strength of using absolute frequency descriptors. },

  abstract={ There is much physician discontent regarding policies that limit time for patient visits and contribute to physician dissatisfaction with the medical profession as a whole. Yet little is known about how physician strategies for managing time limits correspond to job satisfaction. The goal of this study was to identify strategies physicians use for managing time with patients and the effects these strategies have on job satisfaction. In-depth interviews with primary care providers in various clinical settings (academic medical centers, community-based centers, solo practices, nonacademic group practices) were audiorecorded. Primary care physicians (n = 25). Transcribed audiorecordings of physician interviews were coded using a modified grounded theory approach. An open coding process was used to identify major themes, subthemes, and the interrelationships among them. Three main themes emerged. (1) Study physicians disregarded time limits despite the known financial consequences of doing so and justified their actions according to various ethical- and values-based frameworks. (2) Disregarding time limits had a positive impact on job satisfaction in the realm of direct patient care. (3) The existence of time limits had a negative impact on overall job satisfaction. For the study physicians, disregarding time limits on patient visits is an adaptive short-term strategy that enhances satisfaction with direct patient care. It is unlikely that such a strategy alone will help physicians cope with their broader—and growing—dissatisfaction with the profession. },

  abstract={ Ultradian rhythms, rhythms with a period of less than 24 hours, are a widespread and fundamental aspect of life. The mechanisms underlying the control of such rhythms remain only partially understood. Defecation in C. elegans is a very tightly controlled rhythmic process. Underlying the defecation motor programme is an oscillator which functions in the intestinal cells of the animal. This mechanism includes periodic calcium release and subsequent intercellular calcium waves which in turn regulate the muscle contractions that make up the defecation motor programme. Here we investigate the role of TRPM cation channels in this process. We use RNA interference (RNAi) to perturb TRPM channel gene expression. We show that combined knock down of two of the TRPM encoding genes, gon-2 and gtl-1, results in an increase in the variability of the cycle but no change in the mean, in normal culture conditions. By altering the mean using environmental (temperature) and genetic approaches we show that this increase in variability is separable from changes in the mean. We show that gon-2 and gtl-1 interact with components of the calcium signalling machinery (itr-1 the C. elegans inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor) and with plasma membrane ion channels (flr-1 and kqt-3) which are known to regulate the defecation oscillator. Interactions with these genes result in changes to the mean period and variability. We also show that knocking down a putative transcription factor can suppress the increased variability caused by reduction of gon-2 and gtl-1 function. We also identify a previously unrecognised tendency of the defecation cycle to compensate for cycles with aberrant length by adjusting the length of the following cycle. Thus TRPM channels regulate the variability of the defecation oscillator in C. elegans. We conclude that the mean and the variability of the defecation oscillator are separable. Our results support the notion that there is a strong underlying pacemaker which is able to function independently of the observable defecation rhythm and is not perturbed by increases in the variability of the cycle. The interaction of gon-2 and gtl-1 with other components of the oscillator shows that TRPM channels play an important role in the oscillator machinery. Such a role may be through either regulation of cation levels or membrane properties or both. Specifically our results support previous proposals that gon-2 and gtl-1 regulate IP3 signalling and that kqt-3 may act by altering calcium influx. Our results provide novel insights into the properties of the defecation oscillator and thus to our understanding of ultradian rhythms. },

  abstract={ Elevated β-catenin levels in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells lead to increased trans-activation of ‘protumorigenic’ β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) target genes such as cyclin D1. Therefore, possible targets for the anti-CRC activity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are β-catenin and catenin-related transcription (CRT). We tested the antiproliferative activity and the effects on levels of β-catenin and cyclin D1 protein, as well as CRT (measured using a synthetic β-catenin/TCF-reporter gene [TOPflash]), of a panel of NSAIDs (indomethacin, diclofenac, sulindac sulphide and sulphone, rofecoxib; range 10–600 μM) on SW480 human CRC cells in vitro. Following NSAID treatment, there was no consistent relationship between reduced cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and changes in β-catenin protein levels or CRT. All the NSAIDs, except rofecoxib, decreased nuclear β-catenin content and cyclin D1 protein levels in parallel with their antiproliferative activity. However, cyclin D1 downregulation occurred prior to a decrease in total β-catenin protein levels and there was no correlation with changes in CRT, suggesting the existence of CRT-independent effects of NSAIDs on cyclin D1 expression. In summary, NSAIDs have differential effects on β-catenin protein and CRT, which are unlikely to fully explain their effects on cyclin D1 and their antiproliferative activity on human CRC cells in vitro. },

  abstract={ Surface water samples were collected from Langtang Lirung glacier outlet point to the Narayani river system in central Nepal in order to investigate the role of elevation in the variation of chemistry along the drainage networks. The chemistry of Langtang–Narayani river system was dominated by sulfide oxidation coupled with carbonate dissolution and weathering of silicate minerals. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were relatively higher than other cations and the sum of both species strongly correlated with alkalinity, supporting the dissolution of carbonate and dolomite as the dominant source for these ions. Aluminosilicate minerals primarily as albite and anorthite appeared as dominant silicate minerals within the drainage basin. Bisiallitization was the dominant type of weathering within the entire drainage system. Hydrogen ion concentration was lower in the low elevation sites than in high elevation sites reflecting the more consumption of carbon dioxide in the low elevation sites due to enhanced chemical weathering rates. Furthermore, major solutes like sum of base cations, silicon as well as alkalinity increased in concentration in the lower elevation sites. All regulating factors appeared to be directly related to elevation and hence elevation appeared to be the prime factor for the variation in chemical species along the Langtang–Narayani river system. },

  abstract={ Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and blocking this process might be a valid tool for the control of cancer growth. We showed previously that tumor angiogenesis in integrin α1-null mice is reduced compared to that of wild type animals and that over-expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the α1-null and consequent generation of angiostatin (an inhibitor of endothelial cell growth) from circulating plasminogen was implicated in the mechanism of tumor inhibition. Our findings suggested that secretion of excess MMPs generates inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation, including but not necessarily limited to angiostatin, resulting ultimately in auto-inhibition of angiogenesis. Thus MMP inhibitors used as anti-tumor drugs might in fact cause a paradoxical increase in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In order to determine whether MMP-9 expression was directly involved in the regulation of tumor growth, we specifically inhibited or enhanced MMP-9 synthesis in vitro and in vivo, and subsequently analysed primary endothelial cell proliferation and angiostatin synthesis, as well as tumor vascularization and development. We provide evidence that reduction of plasma levels of MMP-9 in either normal or integrin α1-null mice leads to decreased synthesis of angiostatin and consequent increased tumor growth and vascularization. In contrast, specifically enhancing MMP-9 expression in vivo caused a reduction in tumor vascularization. These findings are the opposite to other studies suggesting a pro-tumorigenic role for MMP-9, and may account for some of the recently observed failures of anti MMP therapy in tumor treatment. },

The purpose of this paper is to introduce a probabilistic framework for evaluating the environmental acceptability of candidate secondary materials based on the risk of soil and groundwater contamination from leached metals and organics from the pavement. The proposed framework provides a structured guidance for selecting the appropriate model, incorporating uncertainty, variability, and expert opinion, and interpreting results for decision making.

The variability in organic matter and wastewater input within the Bagmati drainage basin appeared to control DOC and most of the trace metal concentration. The large input of organic matter and wastewater creates anoxic condition by consuming dissolved oxygen and releasing higher concentrations of DOC, trace elements such as nickel, arsenic, barium, cadmium, and copper with downstream distance. Concentrations of DOC and trace metals like barium and zinc showed strong relationships with human population density and suggest that human activities have strong control on these parameters along the drainage network. The DOC and most of the trace metal concentration increased with downstream distance and appeared to be directly associated with human activities. The variation trends of most of the trace metals appeared to be the same; however, concentration varied widely. Inputs of organic matter and wastewater due to human activities appeared directly to be associated for the variation of DOC and trace metals along the Bagmati drainage network within Kathmandu valley. },

  abstract={ Many problems and challenges of ecosystem management currently are driven by the rapid pace and spatial extent of landscape change. Parks and reserves within areas of high human population density are especially challenged to meet the recreational needs of local populations and to preserve valued environmental resources. The complex problem of managing multiple objectives and multiple resources requires an enormous quantity of information, and conceptual models have been proposed as tools for organizing and interpreting this information. Academics generally prefer a bottom-up approach to model construction that emphasizes ecologic theory and process, whereas managers often use a top-down approach that takes advantage of existing information to address more pragmatic objectives. The authors propose a formal process for developing, applying, and testing conceptual models to be used in landscape monitoring that reconciles these seemingly opposing perspectives. The four-step process embraces the role of hypothesis testing in the development of models and evaluation of their utility. An example application of the process to a network of national parks in and around Washington, DC illustrates the ability of the approach to systematically identify monitoring data that would both advance ecologic theory and inform management decisions. },

  abstract={ The resolution of satellite imagery must often be increased or decreased to fill data gaps or match preexisting project requirements. It is well known that a change in resolution introduces systematic errors of size, shape, location and amount of contiguous land cover types. Nevertheless, robust methods for rescaling landscape data are frequently required to assess patterns of landscape change through time and over large areas. We developed a new method for rescaling spatial data that allows map resolution (grain size) to be either increased or decreased while holding the total proportion of land cover types constant. The method uses a weighted sampling net of variable resolution to sample an existing map and then randomly selects from the frequency of cover types derived from this sample to assign the cover type for the corresponding location in the rescaled map. The properties of the sampling net had a variable effect on measures of landscape pattern with the characteristic patch size (S) the most robust metric and the number of clusters (A) the most variable. A comparison of up-scaled and down-scaled maps showed that this process is not symmetrical, producing different errors for increases versus decreases in grain size. Rescaling Landsat (30&nbsp;m) imagery to the 10&nbsp;m resolution of SPOT imagery for four National Park units within Maryland and Virginia resulted in errors due to rescaling that were small (1–2%) relative to the total error (∼11%) associated with these images. The new rescaling method is general because it provides a single method for increasing or decreasing resolution, can be applied to maps with multiple land cover types, allows grid geometry to be transformed (i.e., square to hexagonal grids), and provide a more consistent basis for landscape comparisons when maps must be derived from multiple sources of classified imagery. },

The concentrations in foliage were much lower and did not correlate with sediment concentration. Concentrations of low molecular weight PAH compounds detected in the foliage were not significantly lower in plants grown in control sediments, suggesting that the sediment is not the primary source of these PAHs.

  abstract={ During infection, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) takes over the actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells by injecting the EspFU protein into the host cytoplasm1,2. EspFU controls actin by activating members of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that EspFU binds to the autoinhibitory GTPase binding domain (GBD) in WASP proteins and displaces it from the activity-bearing VCA domain (for verprolin homology, central hydrophobic and acidic regions). This interaction potently activates WASP and neural (N)-WASP in vitro and induces localized actin assembly in cells. In the solution structure of the GBD–EspFU complex, EspFU forms an amphipathic helix that binds the GBD, mimicking interactions of the VCA domain in autoinhibited WASP. Thus, EspFU activates WASP by competing directly for the VCA binding site on the GBD. This mechanism is distinct from that used by the eukaryotic activators Cdc42 and SH2 domains, which globally destabilize the GBD fold to release the VCA6,7,8. Such diversity of mechanism in WASP proteins is distinct from other multimodular systems, and may result from the intrinsically unstructured nature of the isolated GBD and VCA elements. The structural incompatibility of the GBD complexes with EspFU and Cdc42/SH2, plus high-affinity EspFU binding, enable EHEC to hijack the eukaryotic cytoskeletal machinery effectively. },

  abstract={ Protein photosensors are versatile tools for studying ligand-regulated allostery and signaling. Fundamental to these processes is the amount of energy that can be provided by a photosensor to control downstream signaling events. Such regulation is exemplified by the phototropins—plant serine/threonine kinases that are activated by blue light via conserved LOV (light, oxygen and voltage) domains. The core photosensor of oat phototropin 1 is a LOV domain that interacts in a light-dependent fashion with an adjacent α-helix (Jα) to control kinase activity. We used solution NMR measurements to quantify the free energy of the LOV domain–Jα-helix binding equilibrium in the dark and lit states. These data indicate that light shifts this equilibrium by ∼3.8 kcal mol−1, thus quantifying the energy available through LOV-Jα for light-driven allosteric regulation. This study provides insight into the energetics of light sensing by phototropins and benchmark values for engineering photoswitchable systems based on the LOV-Jα interaction. },

  abstract={ Classical studies show that for many proteins, the information required for specifying the tertiary structure is contained in the amino acid sequence. Here, we attempt to define the sequence rules for specifying a protein fold by computationally creating artificial protein sequences using only statistical information encoded in a multiple sequence alignment and no tertiary structure information. Experimental testing of libraries of artificial WW domain sequences shows that a simple statistical energy function capturing coevolution between amino acid residues is necessary and sufficient to specify sequences that fold into native structures. The artificial proteins show thermodynamic stabilities similar to natural WW domains, and structure determination of one artificial protein shows excellent agreement with the WW fold at atomic resolution. The relative simplicity of the information used for creating sequences suggests a marked reduction to the potential complexity of the protein-folding problem. It is widely believed that a protein's amino acid sequence contains all the information needed to dictate its structure, but exactly what information is both necessary and sufficient for generating a folded, functional protein is not clear. Two papers by Rama Ranganathan and co-workers tackle this question using computational protein design to construct artificial WW domains, small proteins of approximately 40 amino acid residues that bind to proline-rich sequences. The synthetic proteins adopt the characteristic WW structure and recognize typical WW target sequences. Since the information used in designing these proteins was obtained from multiple sequence alignments only, with no prior knowledge of three-dimensional structure, it is clear that for some proteins, a relatively small quantity of sequence information is sufficient to specify the complex amino acid interactions that make up a functional protein. },

Although X-ray crystal structures of single-domain BLUF proteins have been determined, there have not been any reports of a structure of a BLUF protein that also contained a functional 'output' domain. For this reason, the mechanism(s) of light activation for this class of photoreceptors has remained enigmatic. Here, Thomas Barends and colleagues report the first biochemical, structural, and mechanistic characterization of a full-length, active photoreceptor. The protein is from the bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae, and it contains the BLUF sensor domain and a phosphodiesterase output domain that hydrolyses cyclic dimeric GMP. The structures of this protein co-complexed with its substrate and metal ions provide a detailed understanding of how light absorbed by the BLUF domain leads to activation of the phosphodiesterase output domain. Although structures of single-domain BLUF proteins—a photoreceptor protein domain that senses blue light—have been determined, there have been no reports of the structure of a BLUF protein containing a functional output domain; for this reason, the mechanism of light activation has remained enigmatic. The first biochemical, structural and mechanistic characterization of a full-length, active photoreceptor containing a BLUF sensor domain and a phosphodiesterase EAL output domain is now reported. The ability to respond to light is crucial for most organisms. BLUF is a recently identified photoreceptor protein domain that senses blue light using a FAD chromophore1. BLUF domains are present in various proteins from the Bacteria, Euglenozoa and Fungi. Although structures of single-domain BLUF proteins have been determined2,3,4, none are available for a BLUF protein containing a functional output domain; the mechanism of light activation in this new class of photoreceptors has thus remained poorly understood. Here we report the biochemical, structural and mechanistic characterization of a full-length, active photoreceptor, BlrP1 (also known as KPN_01598), from Klebsiella pneumoniae5. BlrP1 consists of a BLUF sensor domain and a phosphodiesterase EAL output domain which hydrolyses cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). This ubiquitous second messenger controls motility, biofilm formation, virulence and antibiotic resistance in the Bacteria6,7,8,9. Crystal structures of BlrP1 complexed with its substrate and metal ions involved in catalysis or in enzyme inhibition provide a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the EAL-domain c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases. These structures also sketch out a path of light activation of the phosphodiesterase output activity. Photon absorption by the BLUF domain of one subunit of the antiparallel BlrP1 homodimer activates the EAL domain of the second subunit through allosteric communication transmitted through conserved domain–domain interfaces. },

  abstract={ Fusion proteins containing blue-light-activable protein domains possess great potential as molecular switches in cell signalling. This has recently been impressively demonstrated by connecting the light oxygen voltage LOV2-Jα-protein domain of A. sativa (AsLOV2-Jα) with the Rac1-GTPase, responsible for regulating the morphology and motility of metazoan cells. However, a target-oriented development of fusion proteins in conjunction with this photosensor is still very challenging, because a detailed understanding of its signal transduction pathway on a molecular level is still lacking. Here, we show through molecular dynamics simulation that, after formation of the cysteinyl-flavin mononucleotide (FMN) adduct, the signalling pathway begins with a rotational reorientation of the residue glutamine 1029 adjacent to the FMN chromophore, transmitting stress through the Iβ strand towards the LOV2-Jα interface. This then results in the breakage of two H-bonds, namely, glutamic acid 1034–Gln995 and aspartic acid (Asp) 1056–Gln1013, at opposite sides of the interface between the Jα helix and the LOV2 domain, ultimately leading to a disruption of Jα helix from the LOV2 core. Fusion proteins containing blue-light-activated domains have been used as molecular switches to investigate cell signalling, but molecular understanding of the transduction pathway is lacking. Here, MD simulations are used to elucidate the transduction mechanism in a light oxygen voltage2-Ja photosensor. },

  abstract={ With evolving technologies, a way of learning is broaden with availability of open teaching and learning materials. Educators and learners often find relevant resources that can assist them in their respective teaching and learning activities; however, most of the time they are bombarded with redundant and/or low-quality information sources via search engines. In the context of personalised teaching and learning, this becomes even more challenging as the educators and learners are looking for specific resources, for specific concepts, and for specific domain of interest. To add to this complexity, the emergence of Big Data is making the situation even worse as new information is emerging on the web every day; hence, the need for a system assisting in this is becoming more prominent. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to identify suitable teaching and learning resources in order to promote individual learning process. As the text or web data for presenting teaching and learning preferences for educators and learners is imprecise, inconsistent, and non-consensual, the smart learning system has potential to be developed based on fuzzy ontology and fuzzy recommendation engine which can address the uncertain and subjective judgments in determining teaching and learning material and evaluating multiple intelligence.

We use support vector machines (SVM) to personalize and improve students' educational experiences by using the Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as our theoretical framework. In the very first step, we started with the collection of diverse student information, such as academic records, athletic prowess, and many intelligence profiles. To obtain this information, multiple skills of all the students were thoroughly analyzed using MI’s theory. By conducting thorough feature engineering and data preprocessing, we established the foundation for our analysis using SVM. In this phase, we score each student's performance in sports-related skills. From there, we created a profile for each student and preprocessed the data to build a useful dataset. This dataset trains an SVM model to forecast student engagement and performance using specific kernels and hyperparameters. Our proposed system places a big emphasis on personalized learning. We enable teachers to design a learning environment that fosters student potential by adapting teaching tactics to individual student's strengths and limitations in both sports skills and multiple intelligences. The effectiveness of the system is assessed by separating the students into two groups: one group received training using our suggested system, known as the experimental group, and the other group, known as the control group, received training using the conventional approach. The result shows that the score of the experimental group is 88.9, which is higher than the control group's 83.5. The result shows that after applying MI’s theory and SVM in physical education teaching in colleges and universities, the scores have been significantly improved, which can maximize the students' multiple intelligences. },

  abstract={ Nowadays within the global economy, organizations of all kinds require strategic information to ensure that their decision making is competitive in uncertain complex environments. This is a key factor for knowledge-intensive companies insofar as this has an impact on their capacity to anticipate, influence and collaborate. Specialized literature is beginning to connect two disciplines such as strategic intelligence and public relations from an enterprise management approach, proposing concepts such as “Public Relations Intelligence”. This paper aims to explore their research areas using bibliometric analysis to uncover how those disciplines evolve in order to propose future research fronts relating to technological observatories. Firstly, a systematic review was carried out to identify and systematize available scientific information between 2006 and 2016 in publications with international impact from common topics. Secondly, it employed bibliometric analysis based on patterns of co-citation and the co-occurrence of keywords to focus on assessing impact and maturity. The main findings suggest that there is an already potential emerging research field between strategic intelligence and public relations which is highlighting common topics such as strategy, issue management, reputation and the American countries-territories being the dominant literature. This work provides evidence to claim a need to foster the conditions for consolidation of this field as a topic of research and it might well be a valuable opportunity to enhance technological observatories in the networked society. },

In spite of claims that mathematical creativity is an ill-defined area of inquiry in mathematics education, the literature from psychology can serve as an illustration for steady progress on numerous fronts including well defined terminology, established links between constructs (e.g., creativity and intelligence; creativity and motivation), integrated perspectives that resolve dichotomies (e.g., process vs product), and theories that are verifiable through empirical research. Psychology can provide us with prospects to pursue well defined lines of inquiry, and absolve us from the pressure of re-inventing well known findings. Three postulates and corollaries are provided with caveats to provoke readers and to stimulate future progress. },

  abstract={ More intellectual modesty, but also conceptual clarity is urgently needed in AI, perhaps more than in many other disciplines. AI research has been coined by hypes and hubris since its early beginnings in the 1950s. For instance, the Nobel laureate Herbert Simon predicted after his participation in the Dartmouth workshop that “machines will be capable, within 20&nbsp;years, of doing any work that a man can do”. And expectations are in some circles still high to overblown today. This paper addresses the demand for conceptual clarity and introduces precise definitions of “strong AI”, “superintelligence”, the “technological singularity”, and “artificial general intelligence” which ground in the work by the computer scientist Judea Pearl and the psychologist Howard Gardner. These clarifications allow us to embed famous arguments from the philosophy of AI in a more analytic context. },

  abstract={ The Theory of multiple intelligences suggests that it is necessary to develop new methods to assess and conceptualise the human intellect. It is envisaged that serious games can offer an alternative form of evaluation, as game designers can create gameplay environments that incorporate the different intelligences into clues, puzzles and game challenges, so that players can not only acquire knowledge, social support and self-efficacy, but also easily evaluate their skills and abilities. This study aims to analyse the classificatory precision of cognitive profiles acquired from the use of a serious game based on multiple intelligences as well as examine the agreement between the serious game results and a self-report questionnaire. The sample consisted of 209 participants (22.5% men), aged between 19 and 59&nbsp;years (M = 22.83, SD = 6.36) from secondary to higher education. The results revealed that the serious game presented a different classification capacity compared to the self-report questionnaire. The possibility of identifying different cognitive profiles would have implications for educators and researchers. For educators, it would allow the incorporation of more individualised and inclusive education practices, by adapting teaching methods to each student’s learning style. For researchers, it would shed light on the various structures of multiple intelligences in different samples. },

  abstract={ Some prominent scientists and philosophers have stated openly that moral and political considerations should influence whether we accept or promulgate scientific theories. This widespread view has significantly influenced the development, and public perception, of intelligence research. Theories related to group differences in intelligence are often rejected a priori on explicitly moral grounds. Thus the idea, frequently expressed by commentators on science, that science is “self-correcting”—that hypotheses are simply abandoned when they are undermined by empirical evidence—may not be correct in all contexts. In this paper, documentation spanning from the early 1970s to the present is collected, which reveals the influence of scientists’ moral and political commitments on the study of intelligence. It is suggested that misrepresenting findings in science to achieve desirable social goals will ultimately harm both science and society. },

Correlational design with quantitative and qualitative research methods was employed in achieving the research objectives. Accordingly, questionnaires and semi-structured interview guides were used to collect data. The sample of the study was 230 Jimma College of Teachers Education students. Data were analyzed using mean and standard deviation, multiple linear regressions, and thematic analysis. The result showed that emotional and spiritual intelligence significantly accounted for marital decision-making at (b = .398, t (4.963), p = .000; b = .865, t (11.359), p = .000 respectively at (R2 = .628). The mean of college students on marital decision-making was found to be 55.6267 with a standard deviation of 8.9692. Qualitative data result indicated that college students made a relationship for temporary sexual life to support one another for economic interdependence and support on academic tasks than for permanent future marital life. In conclusion, emotional and spiritual intelligence were accounted for marital decision-making. Marriage and family counseling courses need to be launched by Oromia Education Bureau to minimize variation among college students on marital decision-making. },

  abstract={ The human race is one of the youngest species on earth and considers itself very intelligent compared to other species. Indeed, humanity has advanced in all spheres and enjoys a lifestyle of comfort and luxury compared with earlier generations. Nevertheless, this same intelligent humanity is causing various problems for itself and other species as well as non-living things. Today, professionals, students, and people in general are familiar with the theories on intelligence developed in the West. However, despite the importance and comprehensiveness of these theories, we seem to lack an understanding of the wisdom provided by ancient scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita regarding what intelligence is. This paper deals with interpreting and comprehending intelligence based on the Bhagavad Gita. It also addresses why emotional intelligence is essential, dives deeper into the understanding of the five parameters of emotional intelligence identified by Daniel Goleman, and helps comprehend them from the perspective of the Bhagavad Gita. According to the Bhagavad Gita, awareness and understanding of the comprehensive meaning of intelligence and emotional intelligence can inspire academicians, professionals, and students to strengthen and enhance their emotional intelligence rather than focus only on their intelligence quotient (IQ). Such an approach would provide a sustainable solution to various issues and help humans have sustainable and purposeful lives. },

In this paper, we analyze the inclusion of SD in AI research indexed by the IEEE Xplore database from 2000 to 2019. We address three critical questions: (1) To what extent is AI research addressing the sustainable development goals (SDGs)? (2) Which subject areas of AI show an emerging interest in SD? And (3) What patterns of collaboration between regions of the world are being stimulated by AI? Our scientometric analysis consists of (1) Identifying the number of AI papers that address SDGs in their titles, abstracts, and keywords. (2) Developing a composite indicator based on the number of documents produced, scientific impact, and inventive impact to distinguish areas with an emerging interest in SD; (3) Exploring co-authorship networks at three levels: region, income group, and country. The overall results show that a small share of papers is explicitly focused on SD. Our composite indicator allowed us to identify an emerging interest in SD from Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, Education, Consumer Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Electromagnetic Compatibility and Interference. Specifically, on AI subjects, we found emerging interests in Prediction Methods, Computation Theory, Machine Learning, Learning (artificial intelligence), and Biological Neural Networks. Inter-regional and inter-income group collaboration are limited, and network power is concentrated in a few countries. The results could be useful to improve the connection between technical knowledge, strategic planning for S&amp;T investment, and SD policies. },

  abstract={ Many educators who advocate the use of multiple intelligences theory are claiming its efficiency in teaching practice across various education settings and modes. Despite its claimed potential to enhance teaching and learning through increased attention to students’ learning styles and preferences, the use of this theory seems to be largely ignored in higher education settings. In providing an optimal learning environment for learners, educators need to understand students’ prior experiences and current perceptions, in order to make best use of digital technology affordances to improve student learning. This mixed-methods research focuses on the differences in students’ MI according to age and gender and students’ perceptions of the value of online videos and reports whether employing various types of videos within a learning module could increase and support learning needs and intelligences of students. The quantitative findings of the study revealed that students are higher on Intrapersonal intelligence and lower in Existential intelligence. Bodily-Kinesthetic and Verbal-Linguistic intelligences were also found as other highly developed intelligences of students. In addition, significant differences between the MI profiles of the students and their age and gender categories were found. The qualitative phase of the study revealed that videos could address students’ various intelligence types and abilities. Students also reported that video integration could improve their learning abilities and experience. },

This paper argues that the independent intelligences research program is degenerating, since it has not led to novel, empirically corroborated predictions. However, despite its flaws, the program provides an illustrative example of some of the philosophical problems that inhere in Lakatos’s so-called “methodology”. Indeed, Lakatos’s conceptions of the negative heuristic, the positive heuristic, and the relationship between scientific appraisal and advice are all vulnerable to objections. The upshot is that theories of independent intelligences indeed teach us more about philosophy of science than about the nature of human intelligence. },

Social chatbots’ appeal lies not only in their ability to respond to users’ diverse requests, but also in being able to establish an emotional connection with users. The latter is done by satisfying users’ need for communication, affection, as well as social belonging. To further the advancement and adoption of social chatbots, their design must focus on user engagement and take both intellectual quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) into account. Users should want to engage with a social chatbot; as such, we define the success metric for social chatbots as conversation-turns per session (CPS). Using XiaoIce as an illustrative example, we discuss key technologies in building social chatbots from core chat to visual awareness to skills. We also show how XiaoIce can dynamically recognize emotion and engage the user throughout long conversations with appropriate interpersonal responses. As we become the first generation of humans ever living with artificial intelligenc (AI), we have a responsibility to design social chatbots to be both useful and empathetic, so they will become ubiquitous and help society as a whole. },

Here, the failure to meticulously regulate environmental parameters may precipitate escalated production expenditures. Our research is primarily focused on the optimization of plant growth parameters, with the objective of maximizing production yield whilst concurrently minimizing associated costs, thereby constituting a multi-objective problem (MOP). Central to our investigation is the identification of optimal values for key growth parameters, encompassing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, light intensity (LI), duration of light exposure (DL), specific Centella Asiatica Urban (CAU) cultivars or strains (SC), and the balanced distribution of different light spectra within the growth environment (RL).To achieve our objectives, we have develop a new hybrid approach combining statistical methods and metaheuristics is proposed to solve the MOP. We integrate a D-optimal design, multiple regression, and an innovative artificial multiple intelligence system (AMIS). This study, makes a significant contribution to the theory and practice by introducing a comprehensive and species-specific cultivation model, using as an example CAU.Through rigorous comparative analysis, the advantage of the AMIS algorithm over genetic algorithms (GA) and differential evolution algorithms (DE) is evident, resulting in substantial yield improvements. Our findings demonstrate an enhancement of 14.27%, 5.24%, 4.41% and 5.11%concerning real experiments, design-expert prediction (DEP), DE, and GA, respectively. Additionally, the implementation of AMIS facilitates significant cost reductions, boasting savings of 8.63%, 5.28%, 4.23%, and 4.05% compared to the real experiment, DEP, DE, and GA, respectively. },

Eight intelligence boxes (IBs) have been newly designed to serve as AMIS improvement tools presented in this study. Furthermore, a novel formula has been developed to efficiently select the appropriate IB for various types of problems. The developed method will be incorporated into a vegetable land allocation decision support system. The decision-making of the planning about land allocation for crops, including what to grow and what is in demand during specific periods, was performed while considering important factors such as production yield, crop planting and harvesting time, vegetable price fluctuations, and plant incompatibility, leading to a sustainable production system and achieving the highest prices and annual income. Moreover, the developed vegetable crop land allocation models yield the similarity of the average profit per area, so farmers could plan their crops accordingly. To solve the problem, a mathematical model was proposed to solve a small-sized problem, while a novel metaheuristic called the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS) was applied to solve larger-sized problems. The computational results revealed that AMIS outperformed all other traditional methods used for comparison in this research. The solution of AMIS was higher in quality than traditional methods such as Differential Evolution (DE), Multi-Agent Simulated Quenching (MASQ), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) by 21.78, 16.38, and 22.79%, respectively. },

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between visual memory and spatial intelligence with students’ academic achievement in anatomy. The present study is a descriptive cross-sectional study. All medical and dental students who had chosen anatomy courses (Semester 3 medicine and 2 dentistry) were the target population (n=240). The study tools were Jean-Louis Sellier 's visual memory test to determine visual memory and ten questions from Gardner Spatial Intelligence Questionnaire were employed to assess spatial intelligence. The tests were performed at the beginning of the semester and its relationship with the academic achievement scores of the anatomy course was examined. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, independent t-test, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression. Data of 148 medical students and 85 dental students were analyzed. The mean score of visual memory in medical students (17.1±5.3) was significantly higher than dental students (14.3±4.6) (P-value &lt;0.001). But the mean score of spatial intelligence (31.5±5.9) was not significantly different between medical and dental students (31.9±4.9) (P-value=0.56). Pearson correlation coefficient showed that in medical students there was a direct relationship between visual memory score and spatial intelligence score with scores of anatomy courses (P-value&lt;0.05). Moreover, in dental students, there was a direct relationship between the score of anatomical sciences with the score of visual memory (P-value=0.01) and the score of spatial intelligence (P-value=0.003). The results of this study showed that there is a significant relationship between spatial intelligence and visual memory with learning anatomy and planning to enhance these characteristics can be fruitful in students. It is suggested that Visual memory and spatial intelligence should be considered for student admission, especially in the fields of medicine and dentistry. },

  abstract={ Studying computer programming requires not only an understanding of theories and concepts, but also coding pragmatism. Success in studying or conducting such a course is definitely a challenge. This paper proposes a model that transforms students’ attributes (including the cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, and traditional lagging measures of academic background) into a set of principal components (PCs). As opposed to traditional approaches, the proposed model optimally extracts the orthogonal PCs to form a basis for determining the studying performance of students in terms of declarative knowledge and procedural proficiency (or skill). The obtained relationship model yields two contributive values (1) an optimal set of determinants, in the form of students’ clusters, to determine study performance and (2) the fully preserved interpretability of the original attributes of students in each PC. The experiment was conducted using 115 complete datasets of IT major students who enrolled the Introduction to Computer Programming course. The Best Subset Selection and LASSO algorithms were deployed to find the optimal set of features. The effectiveness of the model was validated by multiple linear regression to predict the performance in terms of knowledge and skills with an accuracy of 76.52%, and 70.44%, respectively. Insights into the interpretability of student clusters are provided. },

  abstract={ A pluralistic approach to folk psychology must countenance the evaluative, regulatory, predictive, and explanatory roles played by attributions of intelligence in social practices across cultures. Building off of the work of the psychologist Robert Sternberg and the philosophers Gilbert Ryle and Daniel Dennett, I argue that a relativistic interpretivism best accounts for the many varieties of intelligence that emerge from folk discourse. To be intelligent (in the sense invoked in folk psychological practices) is to be comparatively good at solving intellectual problems that an interpreter deems worth solving. },

  abstract={ While universal literacy is one of the most pervasive targets of today’s educational systems, it is at the same time perhaps the narrowest of all goals. Standardised testing reduces language and literacy to tasks associated with reading and writing. As learning communities become increasingly diverse, teachers, administrators and policy makers are finding themselves in a position where in order to maximise student development they need to broaden their conceptualisations of literacy, merge curricular areas and implement inclusive practices. Addressing literacy instructors and policy makers in particular, the authors of this article present a WORLD view of literacy (Word, Orality, Re-vision, Literacies, Discourses) towards making sense of contemporary literacy research. The purpose of this paper is multi-layered in terms of theory and practice. On the philosophical and theoretical level, it is intended to extend our understanding of literacy in view of both historical conceptualisations and contemporary views of literacy. On the reflective and practical level, it offers a unique way to assess our literacy practice and re-vision what we do. Demonstrating the universality of this approach, this is illustrated by a few ideas from a poem, a children’s book, a dystopian novel for teenagers and a film. },

  abstract={ This study explores the transformative impact of the 2019 revision of the Nuri Curriculum on early childhood education in South Korea, which marks a paradigm shift towards a child-centered, play-based learning environment. This paper critically analyzes the reform’s three core components: the adoption of a child-play-centered approach, the elimination of age-specific divisions, and the empowerment of educators. The study places these changes within the context of international best practices and research in early childhood education, drawing connections to renowned theorists like Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, and proponents of the Reggio Emilia approach. It highlights the alignment of the Nuri Curriculum reform with established knowledge of the significance of play-based learning and the pivotal role of skilled educators in shaping young learners’ experiences. The paper discusses the theoretical and policy implications of the reform, emphasizing its contribution to a deeper understanding of child-centeredness and play in fostering well-rounded individuals. It underscores the importance of government policies aligning with global trends and investing in teacher training to effectively implement such reforms. The Nuri Curriculum reform not only represents a significant departure from traditional educational paradigms but also opens avenues for future research in longitudinal studies, teacher education, cultural adaptations, and community engagement. It sets the stage for a more responsive and culturally sensitive approach to early childhood education, preparing young learners for an ever-changing world. },

  abstract={ Intelligence testing has a long and revered history in psychological measurement in childhood. Yet, the years between infancy and early childhood have been understudied with respect to emergent intellectual and cognitive functioning. Factor analytic models of intelligence that have demonstrated applicability when testing older children and adults often appear inadequate in the preschool period. As more is learned about brain development in typically developing children during these crucial years the distinctive relationships between neural system development and intellectual functioning are being revealed more completely. The aim of this paper was to provide a brief historical background as a foundation for discussion of intelligence testing, review what is known about the dynamic course of brain development during the preschool years, acknowledge limitations specific to intelligence testing in young children, and provide support for maintaining a comprehensive neuropsychological perspective that considers the wider range of variables that influence intellectual functioning in the preschool period. },

  abstract={ The bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has a short LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain, which is not connected to an effector domain but has an α-helix extension at the N-terminus as well as a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motiv at the C-terminus. These extensions offer possibilities for interactions with effector enzymes or DNA. Whereas many LOV domains show a tendency to form dimers in the light state, RsLOV is unique in that it is a dimer in the dark state but dissociates into monomers after blue-light excitation We studied the kinetics of this dimerization process by a combination of FRET spectroscopy and stopped-flow experiments with a time resolution of ≈10 ms. Although excitation of the flavin chromophore in dye-labeled LOV domains leads to considerable FRET from flavin to the dye, the typical adduct formation between flavin and a nearby cysteine still occurs with considerable yield. We obtain a rate constant for LOV–LOV dimerization in the range (0.8–1.8) × 105 M−1 s−1, and an equilibrium constant of the dark-state dimer in the range (3.0–7.0) × 10−6 M. Dissociation of the dimers in the light state and reforming of dimers after return to the dark state was monitored using an anti-FRET effect caused by excitonic interaction between dye labels on different monomers. Reforming of the dark state dimers is slower than recovery of the flavin–cysteinyl adduct, indicating that light-induced conformational changes in the LOV domain persist for much longer time than the adduct lifetime },

  abstract={ Information technology (IT) is a competitive advantage to organizations. To achieve this, organizations require innovative IT projects. These, in turn, require the availability and performance of qualified, ethical and healthy professionals. When selecting professionals, the organization must draw attention to technical, behavior and health factors, since these factors influence professionals’ productivity. Decision-makers need support models for professionals’ selective processes when structuring teams, including multiple criteria. This study proposes a novel decision-making support model structured in methods of “verbal decision analysis (VDA)” and “measuring attractiveness by a category-based evaluation technique (MACBETH)” to solve a conflicted dilemma, seeking to assist this process. The model was tested to analyze the desired factors in professionals’ selection process for the composition of geographically distributed teams responsible for developing and implementing IT projects. For the input values, the study used personal and professional qualitative factors, such as interpersonal skills, psychological health, physiological, cultural and intellectual indicators. When tested, the model solved the dilemma through alternatives categorization and prioritization. The test run showed inconsistency’s absence, which would not happen if the methods (VDA and MACBETH) were run individually. The model was executed successfully and had low consumption time and accurate results. Psychological and physiological factors appear to be more defining to the decision making than intellectual level and technical qualifications. Big Data mining and exploration may be a professionals’ attribute obtention way to support the model. },

  abstract={ Accomplishment in various aspects of life is associated with the balanced intelligence of human beings. Intelligence can be classified into several types, each of them has an influence on one’s individual and activity-related outcomes. Depending on the previous literature on intelligent systems, this article intends to trace the evolution of diverging types of multifaceted and multiple computational intelligence in the context of multimedia information framework; right from cognitive intelligence to naturalistic intelligence. We have illustrated a systematic schema of how the multiple and mutually exclusive intelligence categories affect the structural information processing phenomena. We have depicted a set of contextual case studies over the multimedia information patterns, such as images, linguistics, and music to enhance the capability of learning and representation. Thereby, distinctive characteristics of intelligence suggestively influence the entire multimedia information fusion schema in terms of multimedia pattern analysis, information retrieval, and recommendations. We have incorporated three diverge and semantic case studies for demonstrating the multifaceted intelligent information fusion on the multimedia contents such as (a) facial recognition system for auto-generated response management, (b) speech recognition module for response management and interactive system demonstration, and (c) music processing schema for illustrating pervasive music teaching–learning framework. We have evaluated the performance metrics for each of the three demonstrated case studies. The appraised outcome shows that our projected multimedia module-based information processing paradigm provides efficient system manifestation and is effectively capable of signifying multifaceted intelligent computing systems. },

  abstract={ In this work we exploited time-resolved photoacoustics (PA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the function of a conserved phenylalanine residue in blue sensing (BL) LOV domains. The LOV photocycle involves reversible formation of a photoproduct (LOV390) where the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore is covalently bound to a cysteine. LOV390 thermally returns to the dark adapted state (LOV447) with a lifetime τrec (s-to-h). In the LOV domain of Bacillus subtilis BsYtvA, the conserved F46 is one of the few residues undergoing a pronounced light-driven conformational change. PA and spectro-scopic data show that in the YtvA variants F46A and F46Y light-induced structural changes are much smaller than those in the wild type (wt) protein, τrec is strongly accelerated and the energy content of LOV390 is lower for F46Y. MD simulations for each variant in the LOV447 and LOV390 states revealed an overall very stable structure of the BsYtvA-LOV domain. The largest variations emerged for the conserved HB network that includes FMN, Q123 (the “flipping” glutamine of LOV domains), and the conserved N104 and N94, with strong dependence on the presence of water. The lateral chain of Q123 in wt-LOV447 can adopt three alternative conformations, and movements act in concert with F46 flexibility. In LOV390, Q123 remains instead fixed in the orientation adopted in the crystal structure. Interestingly, in F46A, Q123 is locked in a LOV447-like conformation (pseudo-dark-adapted state), in both LOV447 and LOV390. In LOV447 of F46Y the tyrosine hydroxyl group fixes a water molecule, which induces a Q123 conformation similar to wt-LOV390, i.e. a pseudo-photoproduct state. These pseudo-dark-adapted and photoproduct-like conformations of the Q123 sidechain may account for the strong acceleration of the photocycle in the two variants. Given the importance of the “flipping” glutamine in light-to-signal propagation in LOV proteins, the results presented here underscore a crucial structural and functional role of the conserved F46. MD results also indicate that F46 is not directly engaged in permeability of the FMN pocket, but is involved in solvent ordering and the formation of water bridges. },

  abstract={ Phototropins are one of several classes of photoreceptors used by plants and algae to respond to light. These proteins contain flavin-binding LOV (Light-Oxygen-Voltage) domains that form covalent cysteine- flavin adducts upon exposure to blue light, leading to the enhancement of phototropin kinase activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that adduct formation in the phototropin LOV2 domains leads to the dissociation of an alpha helix (Jα) from these domains as part of the light-induced activation process. However, crystal structures of LOV domains both in the presence and absence of the Jα helix show very few differences between dark and illuminated states, and thus the precise mechanism through which adduct formation triggers helical dissociation remains poorly understood. Using Avena sativa phototropin 1 LOV2 as a model system, we have studied the interactions of the LOV domain core with the Jα helix through a series of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Here we show that conformational transitions of a conserved glutamine residue in the flavin binding pocket are coupled to altered dynamics of the Jα helix both through a shift in dynamics of the main β-sheet of the LOV domain core and through a secondary pathway involving the N-terminal A′α helix. },

Although several studies elucidate the benefits of social robots in the ASD community, few focus on evaluating and promoting physical interaction. Thus, this study presents the development and assessment of a social robotic platform based on soft actuation to promote physical interaction. A total of 35 children diagnosed with autism were involved in this study. The primary outcomes show that physical interaction does not significantly influence the patient’s performance in the activity. However, the clinicians remark that encouragement and motivation increase when the children were allowed to interact with the robot physically. Also, 52.9% of the control group children elucidate the intention of physically interact with the robot, suggesting this behavior is an essential way of communication. },

  abstract={ Social robots are designed to perform intelligent, emotional, and autonomous behavior in order to establish intimate relationships with humans, for instance, in the context of elderly care. However, the imitation of qualities usually assumed to be necessary for human reciprocal interaction may impact our understanding of social interaction. Against this background, we compare the technical operations based on which social robots imitate human-like behavior with the concepts of emotionality, intelligence, and autonomy as usually attached to humans. In doing so, we aim at making a conceptual contribution to the intuition that the technical imitation of emotional, intelligent, and autonomous behavior differs qualitatively from human forms of emotionality, intelligence, and autonomy. We conclude that the increasing tendency of social robots to imitate human characteristics and the thus increased human tendency of anthropomorphizing technical systems put forth new forms of human–machine interactions (HMI) that call for a critical examination. Thus, the emerging forms of interaction may lead, for instance, to false, reinforced, and perplexing assumptions regarding reciprocity. Therefore, studies are needed that critically examine the potential consequences and psychological effects that may be associated with the use of social robots, especially with regard to vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. },

We will examine the human aspects of living both on Earth and in the interior 0g environment, how technology interacts with astronauts, and how the design of the interior environments in outer space considers the interaction of technology and humanity from an astronaut’s perspective. These issues are explored with Marc Garneau, the first Canadian astronaut in outer space, and Travis Baldwin, 0g environment designer, who has worked with astronauts in the USA. Both discuss the complexity of living in space and how the ways that we live on Earth in terms of interior spatial environment characteristics might be interesting to consider. Within interior environments on Earth, function is always affected and mediated by social and dynamic human relationships and people’s experience and perceptions. When these experiences are transferred into the 0g environment, small, confined, and highly technological environments augment and intensify human relations. And yet these are rarely considered in the quest for secure, functional environments in space transport or on stations. These issues are discussed from both theoretical and practical perspectives in conversation with Garneau and Baldwin. In the interview with Marc Garneau, the author validates certain theoretical assumptions about the complex and dynamic interactions that occur in space, understanding the ways that astronauts cope in space and become creative in figuring out how to “mold” the environment to become their own, and what design factors are important to consider. Finally, examples of potential design ideas for integrating and humanizing the interior 0g space environment are explored and ideas about how to integrate human social elements are proposed. },

  abstract={ We report the construction of a single-component optogenetic Rac1 (opto-Rac1) to control actin polymerization by dynamic membrane recruitment. Opto-Rac1 is a fusion of wildtype human Rac1 small GTPase to the C-terminal region of BcLOV4, a LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) photoreceptor that rapidly binds the plasma membrane upon blue-light activation via a direct electrostatic interaction with anionic membrane phospholipids. Translocation of the fused wildtype Rac1 effector permits its activation by GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and consequent actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation, unlike in existing single-chain systems that operate by allosteric photo-switching of constitutively active Rac1 or the heterodimerization-based (i.e. two-component) membrane recruitment of a Rac1-activating GEF. Opto-Rac1 induction of lamellipodia formation was spatially restricted to the patterned illumination field and was efficient, requiring sparse stimulation duty ratios of ~1–2% (at the sensitivity threshold for flavin photocycling) to cause significant changes in cell morphology. This work exemplifies how the discovery of LOV proteins of distinct signal transmission modes can beget new classes of optogenetic tools for controlling cellular function. },

Two of the tools presented in this work were especially developed for multivariable calculus courses. The inclusion of these materials in pedagogical activities integrates the senses of touch and sight to the learning process, favoring the understanding of important mathematical concepts related to three-dimensional space. This allowed instructors to present to students a natural way of modeling real world phenomena with proper mathematical language, thus achieving a significant increase in mathematics learning. Tests with control and experimental groups were conducted over four years, and students’ final grades, failure rates and visualization-skills development were analyzed. Students and professors from several countries were interviewed and surveyed to assess perception and experience in the use of these tools. An analysis of variance with a sample of $$N=993$$ students and a significance level of $$\alpha =0.01$$ was performed, finding that the experimental group grades were seven points above those of the control group (on a 0–100 scale) and the failure rate dropped 14%. Moreover, from the spatial mathematical skills test with a sample of $$N=442$$ students, the experimental group obtained 15 points more than the control group, and the percentage of students achieving the minimum spatial skills level required to pass the course increased 36%. Our results reveal a positive impact in the use of these tools to develop spatial mathematical skills. },

While this perspective tracks when technology replaces capricious human judgements, it is ill-suited to contexts where standardized assessments already exist. In spaces like employment selection, the relevant question is how an ML model compares to a manually built test. In this paper, we explain that since the Civil Rights Act, industrial and organizational (I/O) psychologists have struggled to produce assessments without disparate impact. By examining the utility of ML for conducting exploratory analyses, coupled with the back-testing capability offered by advances in data science, we explain modern technology’s utility for hiring. We then empirically investigate a commercial hiring platform that applies several oft-cited benefits of ML to build custom job models for corporate employers. We focus on the disparate impact observed when models are deployed to evaluate real-world job candidates. Across a sample of 60 jobs built for 26 employers and used to evaluate approximately 400,00 candidates, minority-weighted impact ratios of 0.93 (Black–White), 0.97 (Hispanic–White), and 0.98 (Female–Male) are observed. We find similar results for candidates selecting disability-related accommodations within the platform versus unaccommodated users. We conclude by describing limitations, anticipating criticisms, and outlining further research. },

  abstract={ There is a growing body of research suggesting that schools need to respond to changing social and economic dynamics by prioritising “21st-century skills”. Proponents of this view, who have been termed “the 21st century skills movement”, have called for greater emphasis on cognitive and non-cognitive skills development, alongside the learning of subject content and technical skills. This paper explores the potential of International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) schools to respond to this mandate in China, one of the fastest-growing markets for International Baccalaureate® (IB) schools globally. The authors’ research team undertook a multi-site case study of five elite IBDP schools in China. Their findings revealed confidence among interviewees that the IB educational philosophy was conducive to 21st-century skills development, especially through the provision of the three IBDP “Core Requirements”, which are Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), Extended Essay (EE) and Theory of Knowledge (TOK). Despite this confidence, concerns remain about the implementation of the IB educational philosophy in the context of IBDP schools in China. },

The major aim of this research study is to design a ‘Student Model’ on the basis of the individual’s ‘bio-psychological potential’. In this work, the student’s cognitive and personality traits are identified through psychometric inventories such as Benziger thinking style assessment (BTSA) for brain dominance analysis, Kolb’s learning style inventory (LSI) for identifying the style of learning, Howard Gardner’s MI inventory for multiple intelligence identification and Paul Costa R. Robert McCrae’s Big Five personality identification. The proposed model using a fuzzy soft set-based hybrid optimization algorithm for reducing the parameters. The fuzzy softest phase follows fuzzification in which the linguistic variables are formed from the crisp input and generate fuzzy sets further fuzzy soft sets are formed from the formulated fuzzy sets. Finally, the hybrid fuzzy particle swarm-grey wolf optimizer (HFPSGWO) algorithm to accomplish parameter reduction and determine the indispensable parameters and final phase perform student rank analysis. The performance results reveal that the hybrid fuzzy GWO (FGWO) and fuzzy PSO (FPSO)are outperformed when analysing different performances such as fitness function, selection of features, accuracy, and computational time. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to review empirical research articles regarding game-based science learning (GBSL) published from 2000 to 2011. Thirty-one articles were identified through the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases. A qualitative content analysis technique was adopted to analyze the research purposes and designs, game design and implementation, theoretical backgrounds and learning foci of these reviewed studies. The theories and models employed by these studies were classified into four theoretical foundations including cognitivism, constructivism, the socio-cultural perspective, and enactivism. The results indicate that cognitivism and constructivism were the major theoretical foundations employed by the GBSL researchers and that the socio-cultural perspective and enactivism are two emerging theoretical paradigms that have started to draw attention from GBSL researchers in recent years. The analysis of the learning foci showed that most of the digital games were utilized to promote scientific knowledge/concept learning, while less than one-third were implemented to facilitate the students’ problem-solving skills. Only a few studies explored the GBSL outcomes from the aspects of scientific processes, affect, engagement, and socio-contextual learning. Suggestions are made to extend the current GBSL research to address the affective and socio-contextual aspects of science learning. The roles of digital games as tutor, tool, and tutee for science education are discussed, while the potentials of digital games to bridge science learning between real and virtual worlds, to promote collaborative problem-solving, to provide affective learning environments, and to facilitate science learning for younger students are also addressed. },

One of the significant inherent challenges that comes with the use of multiple and varied types of displays for visual analytics is the sharing and subsequent integration of information among different devices. Multiple devices enable analysts to employ and extend visual space for working with visualizations, but this requires users to switch intermittently between activities and foci of interest over different workspaces. We present a visual analytics system, VisPorter, developed for use in a multiple display and device environment, and a user study that explores the usage and benefits of this system. VisPorter enables seamless cross-device activity through lightweight touch interactions, and allows multiple displays and devices to be fluidly connected for sensemaking. },

  abstract={ Initially coined by Weizenbaum in 1976, ‘alien' thought refers to the radical difference with which ‘thinking machines’ approach the process of thinking. The contemporary paradox of over-determination and indeterminacy—caused largely by algorithmic decision-making in the civic realm—makes these differences both more entangled and more difficult to navigate. In this essay, I trace over-determination to Leibniz and Turing’s axiomatic procedures and to instrumental rationality, and I trace indeterminacy to the mid-twentieth century co-development of computers and neurosciences to advance the following proposition: understanding alien thought requires understanding incomputability, temporal swarming, and inscriptive-significational errance. Understanding these phenomena in turn requires understanding thinking by doing, distributed thinking, and ontological indeterminacy. All are present in machinic operations as well as in the twentieth century experimental artistic practices of artists such as Duchamp, Cage, and Xu. These practices rely on indeterminate procedures and function as diagrammatic machines. A diagrammatic machine is neither abstract nor particular; neither an idea that is determining in the supreme instance, nor an infrastructure that is determining in the last instance, but rather instantiates a real yet to come (Deleuze and Guattari in A thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia: Trans. Massumi B, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1987). In this essay, indeterminate artistic practices are used as an entry into alien thought and its correlates—infinity and complexity—by way of aesthetic analogy. },

The present research involved the design of a STEAM contest that focuses on having students use hand tools to produce three miniature models in the morning and then use these models to compete in relay races and tug-of-war contests in the afternoon. They were required to rely on their intelligence practice without the assistance of teachers or parents. Thus, this research aimed to explore the correlates between students’ object-free (bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, logical) and object-related (naturalistic) intelligences, and their hands-on making self-efficacy (HMSE) reflected in their attitude toward quality improvement (ATQI) when participating in a STEAM contest. Data were collected from 330 junior high school students on the day of the STEAM competition and were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the students’ 4 types of multiple intelligences were positively related to HMSE. Consequently, HMSE was positively related to ATQI. The results imply that ATQI was essential for students to win in the STEAM contest, which benefited those students with a high level of the 4 types of intelligence mediated by HMSE. },

In agreement with Hunt, it is accepted that, as any overarching theory in any science, it does involve postulates about the mind that must be scrutinized by further research. However, its main postulates are well supported by the findings of specifically designed experiments. In response to Olson, it is maintained that this theory, as an integration of the standard models of the human mind in cognitive, psychometric, and differential psychology, deals better than its competitors with educationally important questions about what, how, and when to teach important knowledge. In fact, the mechanisms of specified understanding are refined enough to explicate what meaning making is possible at different ages. In agreement with Anderson, it is noted that the theory may direct curriculum developers how to develop the curriculum in different subjects and teachers colleges how to educate teachers so that learning in the classroom may become deeper, more stable, and transferable, thereby increasing the understanding and learning autonomy of students. },

  abstract={ One of the water source areas of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is the Danjiangkou Reservoir (DJKR). To understand seasonal variation in phytoplankton composition, abundance and distribution in the DJKR area before water diversion, as well as to estimate potential risks of water quality after water diversion, we conducted an investigation on phytoplankton in the DJKR from August 2008 to May 2009. The investigation included 10 sampling sites, each with four depths of 0.5, 5, 10, and 20 m. In this study, 117 taxa belonging to 76 genera were identified, consisting of diatoms (39 taxa), green algae (47 taxa), blue-green algae (19 taxa), and others (12 taxa). Annual average phytoplankton abundance was 2.01 × 106 ind./L, and the highest value was 14.72 × 106 ind/L (at site 3 in August 2008). Phytoplankton abundance in front of the Danjiangkou Dam (DJKD) was higher than that of the Danjiang Reservoir Basin. Phytoplankton distribution showed a vertical declining trend from 0.5 m to 20 m at most sites in August 2008 (especially at sites of 1, 2, 4 and 10), but no distinct pattern in other sampling months. In December 2008 and March 2009, Stephanodiscus sp. was the most abundant species, amounting to 55.23% and 72.34%, respectively. We propose that high abundance of Stephanodiscus sp. may have contributed greatly to the frequent occurrence of Stephanodiscus sp. blooms in middle-low reaches of the Hanjiang River during the early spring of 2009. In comparison with previous studies conducted from 1992 to 2006, annual average phytoplankton density, green algae and blue-green algae species, as well as major nutrient concentrations increased, while phytoplankton diversity indices declined. This indicates a gradual decline in water quality. More research should be conducted and countermeasures taken to prevent further deterioration of water quality in the DJKR. },

The aim was to determine how well virtual assembly training transfers knowledge and skills to the trainee in order to improve their real-world assembly performance. To demonstrate this, a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the influence of VA training on the real assembly performance is presented. This influence is assessed in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency when performing the real assembly task after undergoing VA training. The study considers the use of three training modes and several assembly tasks with increasing complexity and number of parts. The results indicate a significant improvement (of up to 80&nbsp;%) in the real assembly performance of subjects who undertook VA training first when compared to those trained conventionally. Moreover, haptic-enabled VA training led to greater levels of effectiveness than without haptics. The results also revealed that the effectiveness of VA training depended on assembly task complexity, i.e. the greater the task complexity, the greater the effectiveness. Consequently, maximum VA training effectiveness was obtained with a combination of haptic-enabled VA training and high-complex assembly tasks. },

It is relevant for a human-centred systems engineering approach to cross-cultural interaction. Language learning is important as valid communication can help interactions and cultural understanding between countries, this also may benefit international stability. There are natural barriers between the English and Chinese language which are reflected in teaching approaches. The teaching of English in Chinese classrooms is removed from real-world English learning environments. The academic environments and approaches focus on the learning of grammar, spelling and writing with little real-life conversation and interaction with native English speakers. English language learning in China is from a more academic perspective rather than practical utilisation. Correct pronunciation and accent is therefore diminished. This study demonstrates that a musical intelligence e-Learning approach can benefit Chinese English language students. },

  abstract={ The ongoing revolution in molecular genetics has led many to speculate that one&nbsp;day we will be able to change the expression or phenotype of numerous complex traits to improve ourselves in many different ways. The prospect of genetic enhancements has generated heated controversy, with proponents advocating research and implementation, with caution advised for concerns about justice, and critics tending to see the prospect of genetic enhancements as an assault on human freedom and human nature. Both camps base their arguments on the unquestioned assumption that the science will realize either their dreams or nightmares. In this paper, I show that their beliefs are based upon two fundamental mistakes. First, they are based upon an unwarranted reliance in a genetic determinism that takes for granted that the traits that we might most want to enhance, like intelligence, aggression, shyness, and even athletic ability, can be causally directed by specific genes. In so doing, character descriptions are reified to be concrete and discrete entities, in this case, genes. Second, they have accepted on faith that there is, or will be, a science to translate their hopes or worries into reality when, in fact, that is unlikely to occur because of the irreducible complexity of phenotypic expression. },

The proposed method has been developed as a decision-making tool for solving mechanical sugarcane harvest operations which have been replacing the manual harvesting system with the sugarcane field burning. The mechanical sugarcane harvesting system is a fresh one with a high potential reduction of CO2 emission. Two resources which are fuel service staff teams and technician teams were considered to support the mechanical harvester operations in order to improve the harvesters’ productivity and stability of its sugarcane supply by minimizing the downtime or waiting time of harvesters. Based on this approach, not only the sugar production is efficient, but also the harvesting which is the inbound activity is fuel-efficient. This problem was formulated as the allocation and scheduling of multi-Heterogeneous Resources with consideration of transportation for both resources and service operations. Sugarcane harvesters which get services from the workforce are geographically scattered in each time period. There are various technicians and fuel service staff with different skills giving services to the harvesters. The workforce allocation (WFAllcn) and the sequences and routing (WFSeqRoute) sub-problems were modeled as the integrating problem with the objective function to maximize the sugarcane harvested by all harvesters. To solve the problem, the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS), which was developed with new intelligence box selection rules, is firstly developed. Using this approach, allocation and scheduling, and routing of technicians and fuel service staff in sugarcane mechanical harvest operations is very efficient. },

  abstract={ Established scholarship in arts education is invariably related to theories of development founded on notions of multiple intelligence and experiential learning. Yet when contemporary arts practice is retraced on a philosophical horizon, one begins to engage with other cases for learning. This state of affairs reveals art’s inherent paradox where the expectation of learning is substituted by forms of unlearning. This paper begins to approach unlearning through the tension between art and education, and more specifically through the dialectical relationship between education’s dialogic agonism and art’s negative antagonism. What is here being proposed as unlearning reflects a critique of the moral-pedagogical outlooks that are imposed on art where artworks are expected to tell stories of truth through their propensity towards the beautiful and the good. In re-reading experiential anticipation as a form of anamnesis (recollection) through a process of negation and contradiction, unlearning is also located in forms of mimetic scoping by which art’s assumed pedagogical trajectory turns into the opposite of recollection: as an act of willed forgetfulness. This peculiar ‘movement’ from a state of learning to that of unlearning constitutes the basis for a special kind of pedagogical aesthetics where the challenges of criticality and laterality articulate a special ‘world’ where learning may well work backwards. },

This paper presents the results of a mobile phone-based intervention conducted in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in 2012–13. The BridgeIT project provided a pool of audio-visual learning materials organised in accordance with a system of syllabi pacing charts. Teachers of Standard 5 and 6 English and Science classes were notified of the availability of new videos via text messages (SMS), which they downloaded onto their phones using an open-source application and showed, with suggested activities, to students on a TV screen using a TV-out cable. In their evaluation of this project, the authors of this paper found that the test scores of children who experienced the intervention improved by 0.36 standard deviations in English and 0.98 standard deviations in Science in Andhra Pradesh, relative to students in similar classrooms who did not experience the intervention. Differences between treatment and control schools in Tamil Nadu were less marked. The intervention was also cost-effective, relative to other computer-based interventions. Based on these results, the authors argue that is possible to use mobile phones to produce a strong positive and statistically significant effect in terms of teaching and learning quality across a large number of classrooms in India at a lower cost per student than past computer-based interventions. },

Currently, people are suffering from the summer heat, with ambient temperatures around or exceeding 40 °C. Phrases such as “killer hot days” are no longer exaggerated statements. Hot weather can not only frustrate people, but also make people sick or even endanger lives owing to heatstroke. Fortunately, scientists have come up with a great invention, which will provide us with some much-needed relief in hot summers—the optical metafabric. The magic of this innovation is that, although it feels just like a normal fabric and has all the necessary properties of a wearable fabric, a garment made with it can cool down one’s body by nearly 5 °C even under direct sunlight, making it ideal for summer clothing. In the last few years, a team led by Prof. Guangming Tao of Huazhong University of Science and Technology has achieved remarkable progress in the area of optical metafabrics, finding new applications for this material and making it more affordable. Now, please follow our Light Science Editor as he explores this amazing new material and finds how it has been used in the industry, society, and Winter Olympics. },

  abstract={ This study aimed to determine the level of spatial ability among STEM students. A universal multiple-choice test was prepared. The validity of the test and the effectiveness of its application were tested. The test is an extension of those currently in use. It contains tasks on spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental folding, rotation of spatial elements, and representation of spatial elements on a plane. The test consists of 16 tasks showing a cube with lines located on the walls. The student's task was to determine the development of the cube and mentally construct a cube based on the development. The results of the test determined the level of progress of the group (105 participants), and showed that a significant number of students have difficulties in perceiving and working with a three-dimensional object. On average 55% of the questions were answered correctly. For the group tested, reading a flat drawing and determining axonometry proved easier than other task. Students who attended technical high school or had design experience scored better. During the course, measures to improve teaching were introduced. Spatial model work was strengthened and initial tasks were adjusted according to the level of the group. Emphasis on teamwork and consultation was introduced for those with the lowest scores. The applied modifications in classroom management had a good effect. The average of the final grade was B. The test is a useful tool for academics and students to study spatial ability and improve teaching activities for STEM students. },

  abstract={ The 454 sequencing method was used to detect bacterial diversity and community structure in the East China Sea. Overall, 149 067 optimized reads with an average length of 454 nucleotides were obtained from 17 seawater samples and five sediment samples sourced in May 2011. A total of 22 phyla, 34 classes, 74 orders, 146 families, and 333 genera were identified in this study. Some of them were detected for the first time from the East China Sea. The estimated richness and diversity indices were both higher in the sediment samples compared with in the seawater samples. All the samples were divided by their diversity indices into four regions. Similarity analysis showed that the seawater samples could be classified into six groups. The groups differed from each other and had unique community structure characteristics. It was found that different water masses in the sampling areas may have had some influence on the bacterial community structure. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed that seawater samples in different areas and at different depths were affected by different environmental parameters. This study will lay the foundation for future research on microbiology in the East China Sea. },

Not surprisingly, marketing and consumer behavior scholars have devoted significant efforts to the study of creativity and have offered a relevant though fragmented corpus of contributions that needs a synthesis to guide further research on such a pervasive, yet crucial, concept. This article presents and discusses a structured review of studies on creativity published in eight major marketing and consumer behavior journals. We classify previous research upon a popular alliterative model—the 4Ps of creativity, person, process, product, and press—to present a comprehensive view of the state of research on creativity. The review is instrumental to the identification of eight research directions, two for each of the 4Ps areas, for future research that marketing and consumer behavior scholars can pursue to produce novel and meaningful contributions on one of the most elusive constructs in social sciences. },

  abstract={ The integration of AI in education, particularly in adaptive learning, emphasizes the critical need for automatic detection of individual learning styles. Traditional methods such as tests or questionnaires, though reliable, face challenges including student reluctance and limited self-awareness of learning preferences. This underscores a research gap in learning style detection within adaptive learning systems, necessitating further investigation into the effectiveness of algorithms/models for automatic detection within AI-driven systems in real-world educational settings. Additionally, the parameters for adaptation experiments, the role of machine learning techniques, and the comparative analysis of different methodologies remain underexplored areas. Addressing these gaps, this study conducts a systematic review of articles from 2014 to 2022, using Web of Science and Scopus. Forty selected papers are rigorously evaluated to understand automatic learning style detection’s current state, challenges, and future directions in diverse educational contexts. This study explores automatic learning style detection in diverse educational aspects, including techniques, approaches, models, and implementation. We find that AI techniques, especially data-driven approaches, enhance learning adaptation. The dominance of the Felder–Silverman model and the versatility of AI algorithms like Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks underscore their effectiveness across diverse contexts. Additionally, our analysis highlights the prevalence of Moodle in dataset mining and learning experiments, demonstrating its importance in research. Our research provides valuable insights into the design and implementation of AI-driven educational solutions, focusing on adapting course content according to learning styles. The aim is to enhance learning outcomes within educational environments. },

  abstract={ A current pandemic which has pushed much work online has revealed a lack of literacies in information security, surveillance capitalism, and the unresolved problems of algorithms and control (e.g., Zuboff, Berners-Lee). Yet there is a decades-old tradition of pedagogies that address the complex interactions of the interdisciplinary technoscientific world (Morin, G. Bateson, Rheingold, Dewey, Freire, Cooper) and the need for ethical approaches (Quéau, Markauskaite and Goodyear, Haidt, Gardner). Some of them emerged from the field of cybernetics (Morin, N. Bateson). Recent events show the need for further popularization of digital literacy, interdisciplinary approaches, intellectual and creative rigor, questions of service and liberty, and dialog on what constitutes ‘good’ professional praxis. This paper considers the always unfinished work of pedagogy to ‘rise up’ above names—here, of humanist technoscience—to consider what belonging together means. Through a largely hermeneutic approach, the problem of the technoscientific and its history in cybernetics is remembered in such a way as to remind us of features of our shared creative odyssey towards ‘something of greater significance’ (Dewey)&nbsp;and to show that uncritically downloading the latest app or giving up on the question of taking professional care is for the lotus-eaters. },

  abstract={ Education is a major force for economic and social wellbeing. Despite high aspirations, education at all levels can be expensive and ineffective. Three Grand Challenges are identified: (1) enable people to learn orders of magnitude more effectively, (2) enable people to learn at orders of magnitude less cost, and (3) demonstrate success by exemplary interdisciplinary education in complex systems science. A ten year ‘man-on-the-moon’ project is proposed in which FuturICT’s unique combination of Complexity, Social and Computing Sciences could provide an urgently needed transdisciplinary language for making sense of educational systems. In close dialogue with educational theory and practice, and grounded in the emerging data science and learning analytics paradigms, this will translate into practical tools (both analytical and computational) for researchers, practitioners and leaders; generative principles for resilient educational ecosystems; and innovation for radically scalable, yet personalised, learner engagement and assessment. The proposed Education Accelerator will serve as a ‘wind tunnel’ for testing these ideas in the context of real educational programmes, with an international virtual campus delivering complex systems education exploiting the new understanding of complex, social, computationally enhanced organisational structure developed within FuturICT. },

  abstract={ New problems accompany new technologies, and there is a rapid change in society as a result of mobile technology, broadband internet and sophisticated games, which of course bring many benefits. However some people selfishly exploit these new technologies for personal gain to the detriment of others. Applying ethical theories to these new and emerging technologies from a legal, ethical and social point of view can provide some interesting insights. This paper surmises some issues arising from the games development industry, and applies theories from an ethical, societal, legal and moral point of view. Data was gathered from 42 computing students across various disciplines and their views/opinions on ethical issues of computer games are presented. The majority of these students were undeterred by the violent content in computer games, and considered aspects such as the graphics, mechanics and storyline as the most appealing aspects of computer games. However, many of them believed that moral and ethical standards should be taken into account by games developers, and by parents when purchasing games for their children. },

  abstract={ Coastal seas, located between continents and the open ocean, are an important active carbon pool. The sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) in these areas is a mixture of terrestrial and marine sources, and can be a powerful proxy for tracing natural processes and human activities. In this study, one fine-grained sediment core (DH5-1) from the inner shelf of the East China Sea was systematically analyzed for TOC and black carbon (BC) contents and TOC stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C). By combining these data with 210Pb dating, an improved carbon correction model and a two end-member mixing model, we reconstructed century-scale high-resolution sequences of corrected TOC, terrestrial TOC and marine TOC contents and identified two carbon depletion events in the DH5-1 record. The two events, shown as two minima in the TOC profiles, correspond temporally to 1985-1987 AD and 2003-2006 AD, which exactly matches the water impoundment of the Gezhouba Dam and Three Gorges Dam, respectively. In addition, the variations in TOC contents and δ13C values before, during or after the minima demonstrate a relationship between the depletion events and water impoundment of the dams on the Changjiang River. The TOC reductions may represent synchronous responses of sedimentary TOC and resultant ecological effects on the inner shelf of the East China Sea to the water impoundment of the dams. These new TOC records reflect the interaction between natural and anthropogenic processes and, accordingly, provide a deep insight and important references for assessing marine ecological effects resulting from water impoundment of largescale dams. },

The word ‘PROSPER’ communicates the purpose of the framework and is also an acronym that highlights the seven key elements that have been identified as contributing to wellbeing: Positivity, Relationships, Outcomes, Strengths, Purpose, Engagement, and Resilience. Confirmatory data on the usefulness of the PROSPER framework, obtained through surveys conducted with researchers from the Institute of Positive Psychology and Education (ACU) and fifty-four educators from four different schools, is presented and discussed. A rationale for the inclusion of the seven components is provided and the PROSPER framework is then further supported by reference to the evidence-informed school and classroom practices that contribute to student wellbeing and achievement and help to build schools as enabling institutions. },

  abstract={ Dance/movement therapy is an embodied healing practice which has been found to foster recovery from depression and boost quality of life. Although kinesthetic empathy holds great potential for addressing emotional dysregulation, it is an under-utilized dance/movement therapy intervention in health optimization, especially in adults living with treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to collect data from dance/movement therapist on how they use kinesthetic empathy to foster self-regulation in adults living with treatment-resistant depression. A survey design was used to obtain this data. Eight dance/movement therapists (practicing in India, Philippines, Barbados, and the United States of America) were recruited. The participant demographics of the survey challenges the centrality of master’s level trained dance/movement therapists primarily practicing in Eurocentric cultures. The survey included open answer questions, and responses received were grouped into four categories: (i) dance/movement therapists’ rationale for using kinesthetic empathy (ii) therapist-described client responses to kinesthetic empathy, (iii) changes in self-regulation patterns of clients, and (iv) potential links between employing kinesthetic empathy as an intervention and witnessing emotional regulation in clients. Overall, kinesthetic empathy was described as a core part of the participants’ dance/movement therapy practice with this population. The identified client responses to kinesthetic empathy were categorized based on deWitte’s et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2021) therapeutic factors of change. ‘Observable client responses’, such as, use of metaphors, verbalization of body sensations and engaging in mirroring were categorized under specific therapeutic factors of dance/movement therapy. Alternatively, ‘emotionally felt client responses’ such as, increase in safety and trust within the therapeutic alliance were categorized under both ‘specific’ and ‘mixed-type’ factors based on the model. Finally, this article discusses movement interventions that may&nbsp;be incorporated by dance/movement therapists while working with this population. Further research is required to identify the long-term effect/s of kinesthetic empathy as an intentional intervention to foster self-regulation in adults living with treatment-resistant depression. },

  abstract={ The performance of the learners in E-learning environments is greatly influenced by the nature of the posted E-learning contents. In such a scenario, the performance of the learners can be enhanced by posting the suitable E-learning contents to the learners based on their learning styles. Hence, it is very essential to have a clear knowledge about various learning styles in order to predict the learning styles of different learners in E-learning environments. However, predicting the learning styles needs complete knowledge about the learners past and present characteristics. Since the knowledge available about learners is uncertain, it can be resolved through the use of Fuzzy rules which can handle uncertainty effectively. The core objective of this survey paper is to outline the working of the existing learning style models and the metrics used to evaluate them. Based on the available models, this paper identifies Felder–Silverman learning style model as the suitable model for E-learning and suggests the use of Fuzzy rules to handle uncertainty in learning style prediction so that it can enhance the performance of the E-learning system. },

  abstract={ Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domains are conserved parts of photoreceptors in plants, bacteria and fungi that bind flavins as chromophores and detect blue light. In the past, LOV domain variants have been developed as fluorescent reporter proteins (called flavin-based fluorescent proteins; FbFPs), which due to their ability to fluoresce under anaerobic conditions, fast folding kinetics and a small size of ~12–16 kDa are a promising reporter system for quantitative real-time analysis of biological processes. Here, we present a small thermostable flavin-based fluorescent protein CagFbFP derived from a soluble LOV domain-containing histidine kinase from the thermophilic bacterium Chloroflexus aggregans. CagFbFP is composed of 107 amino acids with a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa and consists only of the conserved LOV core domain. The protein is thermostable with a melting point of about 68 °C. It crystallizes easily and its crystals diffract to 1.07 Å. Both the crystal structure and small angle scattering data show that the protein is a dimer. Unexpectedly, gluta-mine 148, which in LOV photoreceptor proteins is the key residue responsible for signal transduction, occupies two conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the two conformations interconvert rapidly. The crystal structure of the wild-type Chloroflexus aggregans LOV domain determined at 1.22 Å resolution confirmed the presence of two alternative conformations of the glutamine 148 side chain. Overall, this protein, due to its stability and ease of crystallization, appears to be a promising model for ultra-high resolution structural studies of LOV domains and for application as a fluorescent reporter. },

Two generations of anthropological research also suggest, however, that the phenomenological psychology the two-pluralisms hypothesis uses to characterize the transition from pre-modern to modern societies is too simple. The need and ability to shift between different modes of cognitive and affective experience are not unique to our late-modern age, but characteristic of cultural psychology in most human societies. This is a simple point, but it encourages a subtle shift in understanding as to just why the experience of the two pluralisms can be ethically disquieting, and what measures might be most effective for containing movements of political and religious totalitarianism today. },

The search for this essential structure of mental life has generated various models and definitions, yet open questions remain. Specifically, referring to intelligence by overemphasizing the anthropocentric terminology and its ethnocentric overlay is insufficient to account for individual differences and limits its generalizability in biological and cultural contexts. The present work is an attempt to adopt a different perspective on the ‘g/G’ factor and its measurement. We suggest that intelligence, or g/G, is reflected in a biological capacity that evolved from object manipulation in animals, into mental manipulation in humans, in response to various environmental conditions. },

  abstract={ Diatoms and dinoflagellates are two major groups of phytoplankton that flourish in the oceans, particularly in coastal zone and upwelling systems, and their contrasting production have been reported in several world seas. However, this information is not available in the coastal East China Sea (ECS). Thus, to investigate and compare the decadal trends in diatoms and dinoflagellates, a sediment core, 47 cm long, was collected from the coastal zone of the ECS. Sediment chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), phytoplankton-group specific pigment signatures of diatoms and dinoflagellates, and diatom valve concentrations were determined. The sediment core covered the period from 1961 to 2011 AD. The chlorophyll-a contents ranged from 2.32 to 73 µg/g dry sediment (dw) and averaged 9.81 µg/g dw. Diatom absolute abundance ranged from 29152 to 177501 valve/gram (v/g) dw and averaged 72137 v/g dw. Diatom valve and diatom specific pigment marker concentrations were not significantly correlated. Peridinin increased after the 1980s in line with intensified use of fertilizer and related increases in nutrient inputs into the marine environment. The increased occurrence of dinoflagellate dominance after the 1980s can be mostly explained by the increase in nutrients. However, the contribution of dinoflagellates to total phytoplankton production (Chl-a) decreased during the final decade of this study, probably because of the overwhelming increase in diatom production that corresponded with the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and related light availability. Similarly, the mean ratio of fucoxanthin/peridinin for the period from 1982 to 2001 was 6% less than for 1961 to 1982, while the ratio for 2001 to 2011 was 45.3% greater than for 1982 to 2001. The decadal variation in the fucoxanthin/peridinin ratio implies that dinoflagellate production had been gradually increasing until 2001. We suggest that the observed changes can be explained by anthropogenic impacts, such as nutrient loading and dam construction. },

  abstract={ Faith in the universal moral equality of people enjoys close to unanimous consensus in present moral and political philosophy. Yet its philosophical justification remains precarious. The search for the basis of equality encounters insurmountable difficulties. Nothing short of a miracle seems required to stabilize universal equality in moral status amidst a vast space of distinctions sprawling between people. The difficulties of stabilizing equality against differentiation are not specific to any particular choice regarding the basis of equality. To show this, I will provide a general diagnosis of the difficulty together with its application to the arguably best attempt at a solution, namely to ground moral equality in a form of subjectivity. In his recent book Equality for Nonegalitarians, George Sher advances the view that “we are moral equals because we are equally centers of consciousness. …The fact that we are equals in this respect—that each is a world unto himself—…explains why each person’s interests are of equal moral importance”. Yet the worlds we are unto ourselves can no more withstand the force of differentiation than previous candidates suggested in the literature, and the reasons why run deeper than even some critics have recognized. The prospects for vindicating universal moral equality remain bleak. },

Within this complex scenario, cultural intelligence is proven to be a valuable tool for navigating multicultural interactions. The study investigates the interplay between Cultural Intelligence (CI) and Change Management (CM) at diverse organizational levels and across departments in Indian organizations. Its primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of cultural intelligence and its associated traits in navigating the complexities of change management within organizational contexts. Furthermore, the research delves into the role of learning organizations as a mediator in the relationship between change management and cultural intelligence. Analysis of the collected data reveals a statistically significant positive correlation between cultural intelligence and change management, with learning organizations identified as exerting a noteworthy partial mediating effect. In addition, the study identifies specific traits of cultural intelligence that wield a substantial impact on change management processes. These insights not only provide valuable considerations for organizational practitioners but also pinpoint areas for targeted training initiatives aimed at enhancing cultural intelligence in the context of change management. },

Fibrillation is simulated using a finite element model of the fiber cross-section containing discrete fibrils connected by interfibrillar cohesive zones. Model predictions of nominal stress-strain response for an assumed bilinear cohesive traction-separation interfibrillar behavior are compared to experimental data. Analysis shows that modeling of the microstructural fibril network, represented by a distribution of strong cohesive interactions, is necessary to capture the experimental response. The model provides valuable insight into the unique deformation mechanisms governing fiber fibrillation under transverse compression. },

  abstract={ This contribution to the special issue on transformative learning is an analytical essay that bridges discourses of boundary crossing and urban sustainability. Part I establishes a baseline for understanding the nature of learning that occurs. It begins with interdisciplinary education, accounting for structures, pedagogies, and competencies. It then turns to transdisciplinary education, accounting for multiple connotations of transdisciplinarity, proposals for reform of the university, and insights from two urban sustainability projects. Part II focuses on prospects for transformation, beginning with a broad-based heuristic tool to guide definition and, prompted by the co-editors’ call to consider the role of new technologies, virtual horizons. The final section presents the concepts of an ecology of spatializing practices, a transdisciplinary orientation, double- and triple-loop learning, and methodological agility. The article ends with seven key take-aways from the foregoing analysis. Broadly speaking, transformative learning is inherently a constructivist process that fosters integrative, holistic, and reflexive capacity. The heterogeneity of structures and strategies that have emerged over time provides all parties with a rich portfolio of options for use in both existing institutions and new enclaves. },

Currently, playing computer games have become far more widespread among Iranian youth and teenagers who are mostly students. Accordingly, this study investigated the relationship between the Felder-Silverman learning styles model (FSLSM) and four types of games. To this end, the research data were collected from 121 students at the universities in Qom province. Then the results are analyzed using Pearson’s chi-squared test and Crosstab. Three of seven hypotheses (the relationship between visual learning style and simulation game, sequential learning style and puzzle game, sensing learning style and casual game) were confirmed which can be the guide to design games in the environment of game-based learning more effectively. },

This one describes the experience acquired with the course of Descriptive Geometry and it implements in the use of the technology in the spatial projection, which is directed to students of first and second semester of the careers of architecture and industrial design. Its aim is to learn to develop skills for the understanding of visual perception and spatial expression, under systems of parallel and conical projection in the construction of objects and spaces. The present work was realized with the objective so that the student can better understand the spatial sense for the constructive visual representation. Therefore, the use of technology is established through virtual reality and augmented reality, but with the difference that these representations must help the construction of three-dimensional models with the use of laser cutting systems. Considering previous, basic aspects since it is to determine a system of units, scales or coordinates (length, width and thickness) they go jointly so much in the manual representation as the foxglove. The intention to introduce the use of augmented reality is to locate the student any object represented in a given space. Also, with the introduction of the physical construction in laser cut, the student will confirm the result by itself of the work that he realized. To do this, a user-friendly software is chosen that is easy to acquire, such as SketchUp for rendering in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, as well as the compatibility of this software with others such as the autocad or illustrator to send the information to the three-dimensional construction in laser, ready for the final presentation. All this synergy in which the work whit instruments by hand is combined with digital systems is done through an interaction design. We are not very accustomed to seeing it in this field of action, but this is a sample of what is done with this process of work. },

During the COVID-19 pandemic (pandemic), building capacity in such settings for overdose prevention, harm reduction, and to address barriers to treatment, recovery, and support services required that training vendors use a virtual format. Post-pandemic, virtual training remains a cost-effective and convenient alternative to in-person training. The Behavioral Health and Racial Equity (BeHERE) Training Initiative of Health Resources in Action, which offers eight training modules on prevention, recovery, and harm reduction, delivered 224 online trainings between April 2020 and June 2022. A mixed methods evaluation based upon the Kirkpatrick Training Evaluation Model was employed, which utilized post-training (n = 1272) and follow-up surveys (n = 62), and key informant interviews (n = 35). The findings showed BeHERE’s trainings were relevant, engaging, and satisfying to trainees; increased their knowledge, skills, and confidence; and influenced workplace performance. Some participants also indicated that the training influenced the effectiveness of their work with clients and other staff. The evaluation identified aspects of training that make a virtual format effective at improving the capacity of non-SUD settings to address substance use and support PWUD. Findings offer insights for those interested in delivery of virtual training, as well as training to influence the practice of human service providers across different settings to support PWUD. },

Incorporation of special training instructions improve spatial skills of learners, assisting them to acquire enhanced conceptual knowledge. Through this paper, concept validation of using immersive and interactive technology to attain better understanding of engineering fundamentals is presented. An Augmented Reality (AR) based Interactive Learning Environment (ILE) was developed for engineering undergraduates. Students were pre- and post-tested for technical knowledge through well-defined questionnaire and were administered different instructional treatments; viz. traditional teaching (control group) and ILE-based teaching (treatment group), for topics from control theory. Results of an empirical study indicate that students who were instructed through ILE scored more as they acquired similar perception through interactive visualization, thereby validating the use of AR for educational settings. By utilizing interactive 2D (2-dimensional) simulations, the research work ensures that 3D (3-dimensional) models developed to demonstrate theoretical topics using AR would also be feasible for implementation in classroom environments. The findings of this work instantiate a correlation between the role of interactive visualization and student’s learning for future studies. },

I then ask what the criteria could be for recognizing such an AI as intelligent. I propose an approach in which the relevant criteria are based on the AI’s interaction within the mathematical community. Finally, I ask whether we can deny the intelligence of the AI in such a scenario based on reasons other than its (non-biological) material construction. },

In particular they play a leading part in determining access to traditional forms of participation, such as parties. We interviewed a panel of political experts to explore the selective mechanisms shaping the Italian political system. The results show that co-option is the main method of selecting new members for parties, with the aim of keeping power within well-established structures.

  abstract={ The chain dynamics heterogeneity of the poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) plasticized by triethylene glycol bis(2-ethylhexanoate) (TEG-EH) was investigated by various solid-state NMR techniques. The plasticized PVB shows two domains in distinct molecular dynamics differences, namely, rigid and soft domains, where the latter is the plasticizer-rich domain. The time domain low field NMR was first used to investigate the dynamics heterogeneity of the plasticized PVB, and the results show the decreasing activated energy of components in the soft domain of plasticized PVB (Ea=20.2 kJ/mol) as compared with that of the pristine one (Ea=24.3 kJ/mol). Detailed dynamics heterogeneity was obtained by high-field NMR with site-specific features. The quadrupole-echo 2H-NMR was adopted to elucidate the dynamics heterogeneity of the vinyl alcohol (VA) units, where only the hydroxyl group of VA is deuterated. The 1H-13C WISE NMR spectra show that there is not much difference in the mobility of the VB unit in PVB with and without plasticizer, whereas the glass transition temperature differed by approximately 53 °C. This is further supported by Torchia’s T1 relaxation measurements. The origin of such an unusual phenomenon is attributed to the critical role of the remaining VA (∼22%) in the soft domain, where the VA units locally aggregate through hydrogen bonding. Also, the existence of a mobility gradient in the VB unit has been demonstrated. Moreover, the mobility difference for VB with different stereo-geometry (meso or racemic conformation) is observed for the first time. This indicates the importance of modulating the ratio of meso over racemic VB for controlling the macroscopic performance of PVB. },

Two concrete mix designs and two mix ingredients containing RCA and natural aggregate (NA) are determined at 10% and 20% replacement levels. Results indicate that using RCA in pavements can result in decreases of environmental impacts regarding energy consumption, water consumption and CO2, PM10, and RCA waste generation, but result in increases of NOx and human toxicity potential (cancer and non-cancer) generation. Using the RCA in concrete pavement can ultimately reduce the negative environmental impacts, especially for energy consumption. Nonetheless, selecting the suitable concrete mix design should be carefully determined for each application since the negative environmental impacts can be significantly decreased. },

Even though there are promising results in therapeutic contexts, there is a lack of guidelines on how to select the appropriate robot and how to design and implement the child–robot interaction. The use of participatory design (PD) methods in the design of technology-based processes for CwASD is a recognition of the stakeholders as “experts” in their fields. This work explores the benefits brought by the use of PD methods in the design of a social robot, with a specific focus on their use in autism spectrum disorders therapies on the Colombian autism community. Based on what proved to be effective in our previous research, we implemented participatory methods for both the CwASD and the stakeholders. The process leverages the active role of participants using a focus group approach with parents and specialists, and scene cards, narrative and handmade generative methods with the children. To overcome some challenges of traditional PD processes, where not all community actors are considered, we included a Colombian community consisting of therapists, nurses, caregivers and parents. The proposed PD process provides an opportunity to learn from several community actors (and thus different cultural and social aspects of developing countries), improving traditional robot design methods. In this way, the findings are summarized through a set of guidelines regarding the design of a social robot-device suitable to be implemented for robot-assisted therapy for CwASD. },

  abstract={ In today’s modern world, students must be equipped with twenty-first century skills, particularly those related to solving real-life problems, to ensure competitiveness in the current global economy. The present study employed project-based learning (PBL) as an instructional tool for teaching math at the primary level. A convergent mixed-methods approach was adopted to determine whether the PBL approach has improved students’ twenty-first century skills, including collaborative, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. Thirty-five students of the experimental group were treated with PBL, while 35 students of the control were treated with the traditional teaching method. ANCOVA test for “critical thinking skills” showed a significant difference between the experimental and control group (F = 104.833, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). For collaborative skills, results also showed a significant difference between the two groups (F = 32.335, p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). For problem-solving skills, the mean value of experimental (25.54) and control group (16.94) showed a high difference after the intervention. The t-value (8.284) and the p value (p = 0.000) also showed a highly significant difference. Observations of the classroom also revealed the favorable effects of employing PBL. PBL activities boosted the level of collaboration and problem-solving skills among students. Students could advance their collaboration abilities, including promoting one another’s viewpoints, speaking out when necessary, listening to one another, and participating in thoughtful discussions. During the PBL project, students’ active participation and effective collaboration were observed, significantly contributing to its success. },

  abstract={ The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has been losing ice mass and contributing to global sea level rise (GSLR). Given its mass that is enough to cause ∼58 m of GSLR, accurate estimation of mass balance trend is critical for AIS mass loss monitoring and sea level rise forecasting. Here, we present an improved approach to reconciled solutions of mass balance in AIS and its regions from multiple contributing solutions using the input-out, altimetric, and gravimetric methods. In comparison to previous methods, such as IMBIE 2018, this approach utilizes an adaptive data aggregation window to handle the heterogeneity of the contributing solutions, including the number of solutions, temporal distributions, uncertainties, and estimation techniques. We improved the regression-based method by using a two-step procedure that establishes ensembled solutions within each method (input-output, altimetry, or gravimetry) and then estimates the method-independent reconciled solutions. For the first time, 16 contributing solutions from 8 Chinese institutions are used to estimate the reconciled mass balance of AIS and its regions from 1996 to 2021. Our results show that AIS has lost a total ice mass of ∼3213±253 Gt during the period, an equivalent of ∼8.9±0.7 mm of GSLR. There is a sustained mass loss acceleration since 2006, from 88.1±3.6 Gt yr−1 during 1996–2005 to 130.7±8.4 Gt yr−1 during 2006–2013 and further to 157.0±9.0 Gt yr−1 during 2014–2021. The mass loss signal in the West Antarctica and Antarctic Peninsula is dominant and clearly presented in the reconciled estimation and contributing solutions, regardless of estimation methods used and fluctuation of surface mass balance. Uncertainty and challenges remain in mass balance estimation in East Antarctica. This reconciled estimation approach can be extended and applied for improved mass balance estimation in the Greenland Ice Sheet and mountain glacier regions. },

  abstract={ The educational significance of eliciting students’ implicit theories of intelligence is well established with the majority of this work focussing on theories regarding entity and incremental beliefs. However, a second paradigm exists in the prototypical nature of intelligence for which to view implicit theories. This study purports to instigate an investigation into students’ beliefs concerning intellectual behaviours through the lens of prototypical definitions within STEM education. To achieve this, the methodology designed by Sternberg et al. (J Pers Soc Psychol 41(1):37–55, 1981) was adopted with surveys being administered to students of technology education requiring participants to describe characteristics of intelligent behaviour. A factor analytic approach including exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling was taken in analysing the data to determine the underlying constructs which the participants viewed as critical in their definition of intelligence. The findings of this study illustrate that students of technology education perceive intelligence to be multifaceted, comprising of three factors including social, general and technological competences. Implications for educational practice are discussed relative to these findings. While initially this study focuses on the domain of technology education, a mandate for further work in other disciplines is discussed. },

This study examines integrating Betty Edwards’ Upside-Down Drawing Exercise (UDE) into economics education to enhance cognitive and analytical skills. Using a mixed-methods approach with 90 economics students, the study reveals that the UDE helped solidify students’ understanding of theoretical economic concepts, promoting holistic and intuitive thinking. Specifically, the study focused on creativity, creative thinking, decision-making processes, thinking outside the box (innovative thinking), and brain functions in the hemispheres. Semi-structured interviews and Python-based template matching identified patterns in student responses and were analyzed using MAXQDA software. Results show significant improvements in understanding theoretical economic concepts, advocating for including creative exercises in the curriculum. Grounded in Dual Coding Theory and Cognitive Load Theory, this study hypothesizes that engaging in the UDE reduces cognitive load and enhances mental and analytical skills. },

  abstract={ Intelligent agent-based systems are applied for many real-life difficult problem-solving tasks in domains like transport and healthcare. In the case of many classes of real-life difficult problems, it is important to make an efficient selection of the computing systems that are able to solve the problems very intelligently. The selection of the appropriate computing systems should be based on an intelligence metric that is able to measure the systems intelligence for real-life problem solving. In this paper, we propose a novel universal metric called MeasApplInt able to measure and compare the real-life problem solving machine intelligence of cooperative multiagent systems (CMASs). Based on their measured intelligence levels, two studied CMASs can be classified to the same or to different classes of intelligence. MeasApplInt is compared with a recent state-of-the-art metric called MetrIntPair. The comparison was based on the same principle of difficult problem-solving intelligence and the same pairwise/matched problem-solving intelligence evaluations. Our analysis shows that the main advantage of MeasApplInt versus the compared metric, is its robustness. For evaluation purposes, we performed an illustrative case study considering two CMASs composed of simple reactive agents providing problem-solving intelligence at the systems’ level. The two CMASs have been designed for solving an NP-hard problem with many applications in the standard, modified and generalized formulation. The conclusion of the case study, using the MeasApplInt metric, is that the studied CMASs have the same real-life problems solving intelligence level. An additional experimental evaluation of the proposed metric is attached as an Appendix. },

  abstract={ Endorsement of educational psychological misconceptions among preservice teachers can be a threat for reaching educational goals. Therefore, it is of societal interest whether preservice teachers hold educational psychological misconceptions and, if they do, whether these misconceptions can be reduced through confrontation with empirical evidence. Prevalence and refutability of misconceptions were analyzed among N = 937 German preservice teachers who participated in an online survey. Results indicated a high prevalence of educational psychological misconceptions but also the possibility of a reduction through refutation-style texts. However, only few preservice teachers shifted their opinions from (rather) endorsing a misconception to (rather) not endorsing it after reading the text. We conclude that educational psychological misconceptions are common among German preservice teachers and that merely presenting empirical evidence is insufficient to effectively counteract misconceptions. Future research should deepen the understanding of why and wherefrom these misconceptions occur and develop efficient interventions to counteract misconceptions among preservice teachers. },

At 300 K, both surfaces adsorb NO and CO mainly in their molecular states. When adsorbed on Pt(100)-1 × 1, the NOads and COads molecules are uniformly distributed on the surface. Under the same conditions, the hexagonal surface undergoes adsorption-induced reconstruction with the formation of NOads/1 × 1 and COads/1 × 1 islands, which are areas of the unreconstructed phase saturated with adsorbed molecules and surrounded with the adsorbate-free hex phase. In adsorption on structurally heterogeneous surfaces containing both hex and 1 × 1 areas, the 1 × 1 and hex phases are occupied in succession, the latter undergoing reconstruction into the 1 × 1 phase. The reaction between NO and CO on the unreconstructed surfaces occurs even at room temperature and results in the formation of N2 and CO2 in quantitative yield. On the hexagonal surface, a stable layer of adsorbed molecules as (NOads + COads)/1 × 1 mixed islands forms under these conditions. Above 350 K, the reaction in the mixed islands is initiated by the desorption of small amounts of the initial compounds, and this is followed by rapid self-acceleration leading to a surface explosion yielding N2, CO2, and N2O (minor product). These products show themselves as very narrow desorption peaks in the temperature-programmed reaction spectrum. },

  abstract={ A recent visual survey of Abstract Expressionist-era paintings in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG), Smithsonian Institution revealed a particular type of paint layer separation. Earlier work by the authors showed that zinc oxide in oil paint is a contributing factor to the problem. Ten samples from five Abstract Expressionist-era paintings as well as twenty-three samples eight years or older from the Smithsonian Institution’s (SI) Materials Study Collection were analyzed by pyrolysis – gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), and unexpectedly significant amounts of oleic (cis-octadecenoic) acid were detected in samples containing high proportions of zinc oxide (25 % or greater by weight). In a typical fully cured oil paint, the oleic acid is oxidized to azelaic (nonanedioic) acid. Although the formation of zinc soaps in oil paints is well-known, the detection of zinc oleate in paints by Py-GC-MS has never been described. The close-packing of the oleate chains in the plate-like structure of zinc oleate prevents the oxidation of the cis-double bond, and therefore prevents the formation of azelaic acid. The detection of zinc oleate in paintings is an indication that the paint layers are at risk for future separation. },

  abstract={ The current review summarizes the literature on the impact of derived relational responding (DRR) technology on raising intelligence scores. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies in PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science between 1985 and 2021. Fourteen publications involving 15 experiments were identified. For studies meeting inclusion criteria, information was extracted on participant characteristics, design, settings, assessments conducted, intervention protocol and trained relations, mean intelligence quotient (IQ) scores before and after training, and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using a revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2), the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC). Overall, the results suggest that interventions using DRR procedures improve intelligence scores regardless of initial participant ability, diagnosis, or age level. Furthermore, eight of the reviewed studies used the Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training (SMART), whereas two studies implemented the Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge (PEAK) protocol. Additional training procedures were identified, for example, multiple-exemplar training, fluency training, and relational flexibility training. The quality assessment showed high risk for seven randomized controlled trials, and low to moderate risk for five nonrandomized trials. Three studies used a type of single case design; one study meets standards according to the WWC protocol. The limitations and future directions are discussed. },

  abstract={ The innovative application of Crowd Intelligent Devices (CIDS) in edge networks has garnered attention due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence and computer technology. This application offers users more reliable and low-latency computing services through computation offloading technology. However, the dynamic nature of network terminals and the limited coverage of edge servers pose challenges, such as data loss and service interruption. Furthermore, the high-speed mobility of intelligent terminals in the dynamic edge network environment further complicates the design of computation offloading and service migration strategies. To address these challenges, this paper explores the computation offloading model of cluster intelligence collaboration in a heterogeneous network environment. This model involves multiple intelligences collaborating to provide computation offloading services for terminals. To accommodate various roles, a switching strategy of split-cluster group collaboration is introduced, assigning the cluster head, the alternate cluster head, and the ordinary user are assigned to a group with different functions. Additionally, the paper formulates the optimal offloading strategy for group smart terminals as a Markov decision process, taking into account factors such as user mobility, service delay, service accuracy, and migration cost. To implement this strategy, the paper utilizes the deep reinforcement learning-based CCSMS algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed edge network service migration strategy, rooted in groupwise cluster collaboration, effectively mitigates interruption delay and enhances service migration efficiency. },

The spiritual dimension of people’s lives, which reflects heart wisdom, is an important source of learning and is commonly awakened by ceremonies, rituals, art forms, music, drama or storytelling. When acknowledging heart wisdom, educators are honoring First Nations Indigenous ways of knowing. In sacred scripture, spiritual masters introduced narratives to reveal sacred truths that can awaken people’s hearts. Vanier (Becoming human, House of Anansi Press, Toronto, ON, 1998) gives his perspective about heart wisdom: To speak of the heart is not to speak of vaguely defined emotions but to speak of the very core of our being. At the core we know we can be strengthened and rendered more truthful and more alive. Our hearts can become hard like stone or tender like flesh. (p. 87). Pearsall (The heart’s code, Broadway Books, New York, NY, 1998) further states that “one of oldest forms of medicine has focussed on the heart as the centre of the spiritual energy that expresses our soul “(p. 29). This paper will present an argument that supports cultivating spiritual intelligence and acknowledging heart wisdom within educational systems. },

  abstract={ This review focuses on the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) which is the first photoactive protein identified containing a carotenoid as the photoresponsive chromophore. This protein is essential for the triggering of a photoprotective mechanism in cyanobacteria which decreases the excess absorbed energy arriving at the photosynthetic reaction centers by increasing thermal dissipation at the level of the phycobilisomes, the cyanobacterial antenna. Blue-green light causes structural changes within the carotenoid and the protein, converting the orange inactive form into a red active form. The activated red form interacts with the phycobilisome and induces the decrease of phycobilisome fluorescence emission and of the energy arriving to the photosynthetic reaction centers. The OCP is the light sensor, the signal propagator and the energy quencher. A second protein, the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP), is needed to detach the red OCP from the phycobilisome and its reversion to the inactive orange form. In the last decade, in vivo and in vitro mechanistic studies combined with structural and genomic data resulted in both the discovery and a detailed picture of the function of the OCP and OCP-mediated photoprotection. Recent structural and functional results are emphasized and important previous results will be reviewed. Similarities to other blue-light responsive proteins will be discussed. },

  abstract={ Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are cyanobacterial photoreceptors distantly related to phytochromes. All CBCRs examined to date utilize a conserved Cys residue to form a covalent thioether linkage to the bilin chromophore. In the insert-Cys CBCR subfamily, a second conserved Cys can covalently link to the bilin C10 methine bridge, allowing detection of near-UV to blue light. The best understood insert-Cys CBCR is the violet/orange CBCR NpF2164g3 from Nostoc punctiforme, which has a stable second linkage in the violet-absorbing dark state. Photoconversion of NpF2164g3 leads to elimination of the second linkage and formation of an orange-absorbing photoproduct. We recently reported NMR chemical shift assignments for the orange-absorbing photoproduct state of NpF2164g3. We here present equivalent information for its violet-absorbing dark state. In both photostates, NpF2164g3 is monomeric in solution and regions containing the two conserved Cys residues essential for photoconversion are structurally disordered. In contrast to blue light receptors such as phototropin, NpF2164g3 is less structurally ordered in the dark state than in the photoproduct. The insert-Cys insertion loop and C-terminal helix exhibit lightdependent structural changes. Moreover, a motif containing an Asp residue also found in other CBCRs and in phytochromes adopts a random-coil structure in the dark state but a stable α-helix structure in the photoproduct. NMR analysis of the chromophore is consistent with a less ordered dark state, with A-ring resonances only resolved in the photoproduct. The C10 atom of the bilin chromophore exhibits a drastic change in chemical shift upon photoconversion, changing from 34.5 ppm (methylene) in the dark state to 115 ppm (methine) in the light-activated state. Our results provide structural insight into the two-Cys photocycle of NpF2164g3 and the structurally diverse mechanisms used for light perception by the larger phytochrome superfamily. },

  abstract={ Aureochrome-1 (AUREO1) has been identified as a blue light (BL) receptor responsible for the BL-induced blanching of a stramenopile alga, Vaucheria frigida. BL induces the dimerization of monomeric AUREO1, which subsequently increases its affinity for the target sequence. We made a synthetic gene encoding N-terminally truncated monomeric AUREO1 (Photozipper protein) containing a basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) domain and a light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain. In the present study, yellow fluorescent protein or mCherry protein was fused with the Photozipper (PZ) protein, and their oligomeric structures and DNA-binding were compared in the dark and light states. Dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the hydrodynamic radii and molecular masses of the fusion proteins increased upon BL illumination, suggesting that fusion PZs underwent BL-induced dimerization. Moreover, BL-induced dimerization enhanced their affinities for the target sequence. Taken together, PZ likely functions as a BL-regulated bZIP module in fusion proteins, and can possibly provide a new approach for controlling bZIP transcription factors. },

The design of these objects gives rise to new opportunities but requires taking into account a number of dimensions that contribute to smartness. In our view, supported by considerable literature on this subject, smart behavior is the result of proper combinations of several dimensions of intelligence. In the paper we analyze these dimensions, singling out different alternatives leading to different capabilities of smart objects. The contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to guide a designer in making decisions about smartness in the physical object being designed, starting from its requisites. At the same time the framework provides an effective guide to classify and compare smart physical objects according to the type and level of smartness they exhibit. We apply the approach to a set of smart physical objects showing its suitability and usefulness. },

  abstract={ There is a need to conceptualize a multidimensional taxonomy for learner-AI interaction.&nbsp;This conceptual/perspective article shares recent work on AI learner education and further presents new conceptions for a multidimensional taxonomy for learner-AI interaction. A review of the literature is conducted (N = 11). Open coding is used to summarize an&nbsp;overview of&nbsp;work, challenges, and findings&nbsp;reported. The summarized work is then used to conceptualize considerations for a multidimensional taxonomy for learner-AI interaction. The contribution of this work is in identifying unforeseen limitations in characterizing human-AI interaction and presenting new conceptions for a multidimensional taxonomy for learner-AI interaction based on the synthesis of the reviewed literature.&nbsp;This work&nbsp;thus shares current findings and challenges reported by the literature and our conceptions. Four conceptions are introduced, namely the alignment between the learner and AI; diverse metrics for the learner, AI, and learner-AI interaction; feedback direction when summarizing interactions; and what works in human-AI interaction by using prior research.&nbsp;We find there to be challenges with the use of AI by humans. The more interaction time spent between humans and AI may not necessarily lead to enhanced learning&nbsp;and&nbsp; understanding. Humans may exploit and use AI in inappropriate ways such as plagiarism. This eminent threat begs the question to reconsider our evaluation methods in light of AI systems. },

  abstract={ This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the ongoing debate surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its societal implications, with a particular focus on job displacement. The release of generative AI tools for public use, particularly ChatGPT, has created numerous concerns on how these tools will be used and adverse impacts on society. Augmented Intelligence has been introduced as a concept utilizing AI to enhance human capabilities but its distinction as an assistive role is ill-defined. This research provides insights into the reconceptualization of AI as Augmented Intelligence examining their differences in terms of knowledge development, decision-making, and outcomes. Through three case studies, we demonstrate the assistive role of Augmented Intelligence and how it can serve as a catalyst for job creation and cognitive enhancement. We also explore the impact of AI and IA tools as a sociotechnical system and their effect on human cognitive abilities through the theoretical lens of the Dunning Kruger Effect. We conclude with a research agenda to stimulate future directions of research. },

  abstract={ The current research consisted of 2 studies designed to test the effectiveness of automated multiple-exemplar relational training in raising children’s general intellectual skills. In Study 1, 4 participants were exposed to multiple exemplar training in stimulus equivalence and the relational frames of SAME, OPPOSITE, MORE THAN, and LESS THAN across several sessions and weeks. WISC (III-UK) measures were taken at baseline, following stimulus equivalence training, and again following relational frame training. Matched against a no-treatment control group, experimental participants showed significant improvements in full-scale IQ following stimulus equivalence training, and a further significant rise following relational frame training. Study 2 administered an improved multiple-exemplar-based relational frame training intervention to 8 children with a range of educational and behavioral difficulties. In 7 of the 8 cases, full-scale IQ as measured by the WISC (IV-UK) rose by at least 1 SD; the improvement was statistically significant at the group level. These data have important implications for the behavioral analysis of intellectual skills and suggest the basis of an intervention to improve general cognitive functioning. },

This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic use of AI. },

  abstract={ Since Turing proposed the first test of intelligence, several modifications have been proposed with the aim of making Turing’s proposal more realistic and applicable in the search for artificial intelligence. In the modern context, it turns out that some of these definitions of intelligence and the corresponding tests merely measure computational power. Furthermore, in the framework of the original Turing test, for a system to prove itself to be intelligent, a certain amount of deceit is implicitly required which can have serious security implications for future human societies. In this article, we propose a unified framework for developing intelligence tests which takes care of important ethical and practical issues. Our proposed framework has several important consequences. Firstly, it results in the suggestion that it is not possible to construct a single, context independent, intelligence test. Secondly, any measure of intelligence must have access to the process by which a problem is solved by the system under consideration and not merely the final solution. Finally, it requires an intelligent agent to be evolutionary in nature with the flexibility to explore new algorithms on its own. },

This conceptualization can be problematic, however, as the two concepts are not the same and traditional methods of measuring emotional intelligence can have limited practical utility. The social emotional ability development (SEAD) theoretical model introduced in this treatise represents a pragmatic and simplified approach to the development of social emotional ability and competency as abstracted from constructs of emotional intelligence, social intelligence, and sociocultural learning theory. Further, the SEAD model reaches beyond the individual as the unit of analysis to explore, conceptualize, differentiate, investigate, and define the hierarchal, bi-directional, and contextual nature of the dimensions of social emotional ability within close relationships. Implications for how the SEAD model can be used by researchers, practitioners, educators, individuals, families, and couples across a broad spectrum of domains and interventions are discussed. },

  abstract={ The impact of technology in the field of intellectual assessment has, for the most part, been limited to computerized administration and scoring. Anderson’s (2001) theory of intelligence suggests that performance on traditional IQ measures is acquired via two main routes, thinking and dedicated processing systems known as modules. Empirical data used to support this relationship between the speed of basic processing and intellectual functioning have been evidenced primarily by correlations between measures of general intelligence and measures of inspection time (IT). These IT measures allow individuals to make a forced choice discrimination task without a motor component. Because only the time used to cognitively solve the problem is recorded, these responses typically occur in milliseconds. Many theorists (e.g., Burns &amp; Nettelbeck, 2002; Deary, 2000; Jensen, 2006) consider IT to be a more “pure” measure of intelligence, because the influences of verbal skills, memory, and socialization are minimized and results are therefore considered to be more culture-fair. Until relatively recently, IT measurement was restricted to complex and expensive specialized laboratory equipment. This article describes the theoretical background and developmental process of a computer-based IT measure that is easily adaptable to accommodate the needs of the researcher. },

  abstract={ The definition of human intelligence and its underlying psychological constructs have&nbsp;long been debated. Although previous studies have investigated the fundamental cognitive functions determining intellectual abilities, such as the broadly defined executive functions including working memory, the core process has yet to be identified. A potential candidate for such a role might be cognitive control, a psychological construct for the coordination of thoughts and actions under conditions of uncertainty. In this study, we tested a cognitive control model of intellectual ability by examining the association between cognitive control, measured by a perceptual decision-making task and by the attention network test, and general intelligence including components of fluid intelligence (Gf, concerning the ability to solve problems by abstraction) and crystalized intelligence (Gc, related to learning from prior knowledge and experience) measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. We also examined the potential role of cognitive control as a core process involved in another determinant of intellectual abilities, the working memory, measured by the N-back tasks and the working memory complex span tasks. The relationship among intelligence, cognitive control, and working memory was examined using structural equation modeling. Results showed that cognitive control shared a large amount of variance with working memory and both measures were strongly associated with Gf and Gc, with a stronger association with Gf than Gc. These findings suggest that cognitive control, serving as a core construct of executive functions, contributes substantially to general intellectual ability, especially fluid intelligence. },

Using genetic algorithm in order to use for regional land use optimization allocation, the introduction of multi-intelligent body system in this algorithm will be able to enhance the optimization search ability of the algorithm and make the genetic algorithm to obtain land use planning supported. The behavior of the main body of the integrated land use planning decision maker will guide the development of the quantitative structure of land use in terms of spatial layout toward sustainability. The experimental results prove that the target is better than the other three types of scenarios under the integrated benefit model, then it is reduced by 18.67%, 15.98% and 16.61%, and the number of spatially contiguous areas is increased by 9.4%, 13.8% and 0.8%, respectively. The proposed model can reasonably configure the regional land use quantitative results and spatial layout, and coordinate the needs of different land use decision makers. },

  abstract={ Research on the antecedents of consumers’ ethical beliefs has mainly examined cognitive variables and has (with a few exceptions) neglected the relationships among affective variables and consumer ethics. However, research in moral psychology indicates that moral emotions have a significant role in ethical decision-making (Haidt, Handbook of affective sciences, 2003). Thus, the ability to experience, perceive and regulate emotions should influence consumers’ ethical decision-making. These abilities, which are components of emotional intelligence (Davies et al., J Person Soc Psychol, 1998), are examined as antecedents to consumers’ ethical beliefs in this study. Five hundred Australian consumers participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire that included measures of emotional intelligence, consumers’ ethical beliefs and personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism, Forsyth, J Person Soc Psychol, 1980). Results demonstrate that the ability to appraise and express emotions in oneself is directly negatively related to beliefs regarding actively benefiting from illegal actions as a consumer, passively benefiting at the expense of the seller and actively benefiting from questionable but legal actions as a consumer. The ability to appraise and express emotions in oneself is directly positively related to beliefs regarding ‘doing-good’ (pro-social) actions. The ability to appraise and recognise emotions in others is also directly positively related to beliefs regarding ‘doing-good’ actions as well as pro-environmental buying actions. The effects of the different components of emotional intelligence on consumers’ ethical beliefs are (in most cases) mediated by personal moral philosophies. This study demonstrates the relationship between emotional intelligence and consumer ethics and highlights the interplay of affect and cognition in consumers’ ethical decision-making. },

  abstract={ Since years, the logic course in the first year of our Bachelor program in Computer Science, dealing with propositional and predicate logic, suffers from poor pass rates. The students perceive the formal and abstract mechanisms of logic as difficult and awkward to deal with. Many students do not study the course material on a regular basis, which results in poor mastery of the basic concepts and principles. Consequently, students often fall behind as the course progresses. Previous attempts to remedy this procrastination behavior had little success. Since educational games are commended as an enjoyable way to foster learning, we decided in 2016 to develop an educational game for the course. This game, called TrueBiters, is a two-player competitive game inspired by an existing card game. We adapted this card game to propositional logic and digitized it as an app. The development was done in an iterative way. Each version was evaluated and using the received user feedback and evaluation results the game was improved and reevaluated. Based on the results of the evaluations we can conclude that the game is well suited for its target audience, i.e., logically-mathematically intelligent people, and is a good supplement, and even replacement for some of the traditional face-to-face exercise sessions. However, we also learned that a proper embedding into the course is needed to ensure that all students actually use the game and benefit from playing it. In this paper we present the game, explain and motivate its evolution, discuss the evaluations performed, and present lessons learned. },

This systematic review evaluates different types of healthy eating interventions attempting to prevent obesity among 3 to 6&nbsp;year-olds in preschools, kindergartens and day care facilities. Studies that included single interventions, educational interventions and/or multicomponent interventions were eligible for review. Included studies also had to have conducted both baseline and follow-up measurements. A systematic search of the databases Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and PubMed was conducted to identify articles that met the inclusion criteria. The bibliographies of identified articles were also searched for relevant articles. The review identified 4186 articles, of which 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen of the interventions took place in preschools, 10 in kindergartens and 1 in another facility where children were cared for by individuals other than their parents. Seventeen of the 26 included studies were located in North America, 1 in South America, 5 in Asia, and 3 in a European context. Healthy eating interventions in day care facilities increased fruit and vegetable consumption and nutrition related knowledge among the target groups. Only 2 studies reported a significant decrease in body mass index. This review highlights the scarcity of properly designed healthy eating interventions using clear indicators and verifiable outcomes. The potential of preschools as a potential setting for influencing children’s food choice at an early age should be more widely recognised and utilised. },

With the advent of body sensory technology like the Kinect, it is important to use motor activities for learning in good and effective ways. In this article, we aim to examine both empirical illustrations and theoretical underpinnings for the gesture-based or motor-based learning enabled by the body sensory technology. We review and distill salient concepts and ideas from the existing theoretical and empirical literature related to body-movement- and gesture-based learning, and propose a motorpsycho learning approach. In our discussion, the word/affix motor is synonym to gestures and body movements, and psycho is synonym to cognitive activities. We explore the important role that motors play in psychological activities, especially in cognitive learning. We argue that motors can facilitate psychological activities in learning by enhancing information processing, encoding, representing, and communicating. We also call for more empirical studies on technology-enhanced and gesture-based learning to design, practice, and examine the motorpsycho learning approach. },

When they enter a learning context with a low level of anxiety, they are much more likely to become successful language acquirers than those who do not. Affective factors such as motivation, attitude, and anxiety, have a direct impact on foreign language acquisition. Horwitz et al. (1986) mentioned that many language learners feel anxious when learning foreign languages. Thus, this study recruits 100 college students to fill out the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale to investigate language learning anxiety. Then, this study designs and develops an affective tutoring system to conduct an empirical study. The study aimed to improve students’ learning interest and provide adequate feedback by recognizing their emotional states during their learning processes. It is expected to enhance learners’ motivation and interest via affective instructional design. Improve their learning performance by doing so. },

  abstract={ Roma young people are often subjected to oppression within formal educational spaces often linked to the idea that Roma young people are less intelligent than other young people. Intelligence is understood in the positionality of individual ideologies and could become a tool of powerful individuals and groups to create an ‘ideology of normal’ that grants permission to exclude Roma young people. This ‘normal’ view of intelligence can impact educational experiences. This study takes a phenomenological approach, using focus groups and diaries to explore what Roma young people perceive to be intelligence and how this perception could affect their education experiences including their motivation to engage in learning. The data exposes the oppressive culture Roma young people exist in and how racist ideologies of intelligence impact learning and wider opportunities. Roma young people from this study express a desire to achieve academically but value qualities, such as kindness and respect, which are perceived as intelligent behaviour. The study concludes that a recognition of the impact of professional relationships, such as youth work, is significant to challenge oppressive intelligence ideologies. },

  abstract={ Communication skills and acceptable levels of spiritual intelligence (SI) are the prerequisites of the nursing profession, which can significantly impact the individual and organizational performance of nurses. This study aimed to investigate the competency and self-efficacy of communication and its relationship with the SI of nurses. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 and included 312 nurses working in a COVID-19 hospital in the south of Iran. The data collection instruments were the Standard Communication Competence Scale, Communication Self-Efficacy, and SI Questionnaires. Data were analyzed with SPSS software version 23 using descriptive and inferential statistics, and t-test, ANOVA, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression were performed at 5% significance level. The mean scores of nurses’ communication competence, communication self-efficacy, and SI were 89.11 ± 7.32 out of 180, 64.45 ± 5.61 out of 120, and 147.13 ± 11.26 out of 210, respectively. A direct and significant correlation was observed between competence (r = 0.527, p&lt;0.001) and communication self-efficacy (r = 0.556, p&lt;0.001) with spiritual intelligence. The dimensions of spiritual intelligence, including the ability to deal with and interact with problems, self-awareness, love and affection, general thinking and doctrinal dimension, and dealing with moral issues, were identified as predictors of nurses’ communicative competence and self-efficacy (p&lt;0.05). There was a positive and significant correlation between nurses’ competence and self-efficacy with their age (p&lt;0.05). The nurses’ mean communication competence and self-efficacy score were different regarding their level of education and the number of shifts (p&lt;0.05). The mean scores of self-efficacy revealed a statistically significant difference between the participants’ gender and the number of patients under observation (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the nurses’ SI significantly correlated with age, and the mean scores of this intelligence had statistically significant differences regarding gender (p&lt;0.05). The nurses’ communication competence and self-efficacy were at a moderate level. Considering the correlation and predictive role of SI and its dimensions, it is recommended to promote problem-solving skills, improve self-awareness, and pay attention to moral standards to nurture communication competence and self-efficacy among nurses. },

  abstract={ The introductory psychology class represents the first opportunity for the field to present new students with a comprehensive overview of psychological research. Writing introductory psychology textbooks is challenging given that authors need to cover many areas they themselves may not be intimately familiar with. This challenge is compounded by problems within the scholarly community in which controversial topics may be communicated in ideological terms within scholarly discourse. Psychological science has historically seen concerns raised about the mismatch between claims and data made about certain fields of knowledge, apprehensions that continue in the present “replication crisis.” The concern is that, although acting in good faith, introductory psychology textbook authors may unwittingly communicate information to readers that is factually untrue. Twenty-four leading introductory psychology textbooks were surveyed for their coverage of a number of controversial topics (e.g., media violence, narcissism epidemic, multiple intelligences) and scientific urban legends (e.g., Kitty Genovese, Mozart Effect) for their factual accuracy. Results indicated numerous errors of factual reporting across textbooks, particularly related to failing to inform students of the controversial nature of some research fields and repeating some scientific urban legends as if true. Recommendations are made for improving the accuracy of introductory textbooks. },

Although the internal consistency reliability was good for Identification and Connection, further improvement for Realization is still required. The three-factor model was better than the alternative models. This research supplements research on spiritual intelligence in different cultures and contributes to research on the Chinese spiritual world. },

  abstract={ In recent years, spirituality and the meaning of life are becoming increasingly important variables in the study of well-being, health, and happiness. The concept of spiritual intelligence (SI) was suggested as a potentially significant construct expanding our understanding of psychological determinants of human functioning. The aim of this paper was to investigate the factorial validity of the Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory (SISRI;&nbsp;King, 2008) in the context of research on a general factor of spiritual intelligence as a psychological construct. The SISRI was administered to 833 adults in Poland. A four-factor solution with one second-order factor of spiritual intelligence provided an inadequate solution. A four-factor solution with correlated factors and a reduced number of items provided an adequate fit to the data. It is concluded that so far, no data are supporting a single factor of SI measured by SISRI-24, and previous studies, including the original study, show that the measurement with this scale is highly problematic. Without a strong theory and proper measurement, the development of this highly promising area of research may be hindered. },

We argue that systems thinking and the CRP perspective are complementary. The CRP illuminates many of the micro-behavioural, local interaction and creativity-related organizational phenomena whereas the systems perspective is useful for other purposes. CRP misses the mark in its criticism of systems thinking. The insights of CRP should and could be incorporated, not switched, with the systems perspective. The systems intelligence perspective, proposed by Hämäläinen and Saarinen, provides a framework to accomplish that. By integrating systems thinking and the CRP model we hope to provide a platform from which it is possible to appreciate the relative merits of the two apparently conflicting strands of thought. },

By analyzing tactical reconnaissance system and its environment, task-(role)-entity agent mapping mechanism and agents in system organization, the system framework is qualitatively described. By transforming the system into an interaction task request-service mechanism queuing system, a Markov chain of system state transition is obtained, since its state transition process in interaction is Markov process and accords with real tactical reconnaissance behaviors. By solving the state transition equations, the inherent relationship of tactical reconnaissance agents is found and the optimized system configuration is obtained. The established simulation demonstration system proves that the proposed approach and model are feasible and effective. },

The as-deposited Ni-B particles were then transferred from AC to CGO through the metallo-organic precursor approach. The resultant Ni/CGO catalysts displayed excellent catalytic activity and chemical stability against coking and sulfur poisoning in catalyzing autothermal reforming (ATR) of a surrogate diesel fuel, comprising dodecane, tetralin and a substituted thiophene. For comparison purpose, a Ni/CGO catalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method was employed in the same ATR system. These two catalytic systems exhibited rather discrepant outcomes. It was found that the Ni(B)/CGO catalyst was capable of repressing selectivity of ethylene during the reforming process. In addition to this, CGO played a critical role in thermal cracking hydrocarbon chains and inhibiting sulfur poisoning. },

Learning styles are particularly important in educational settings since they may help students and tutors become more self-aware of their strengths and weaknesses as learners. The traditional way to identify learning styles is using a test or questionnaire. Despite being reliable, these instruments present some problems that hinder the learning style identification. Some of these problems include students’ lack of motivation to fill out a questionnaire and lack of self-awareness of their learning preferences. Thus, over the last years, several approaches have been proposed for automatically detecting learning styles, which aim to solve these problems. In this work, we review and analyze current trends in the field of automatic detection of learning styles. We present the results of our analysis and discuss some limitations, implications and research gaps that can be helpful to researchers working in the field of learning styles. },

The application of a ‘common good’ focus to collective intelligence research and practice provides a contextualising space for community practice in the digital age to be considered through a philosophy of community technologies. Community media is presented as providing tools, spaces and processes for such critical considerations to be made. Community learning and community-based learning theories are discussed and drawn together to illustrate how community–university partnerships can be developed to facilitate and promote collective intelligence for the common good.

The review was made based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) review methodology. To achieve this aim, 583 prior studies from 2013 to 2022 from ERIC and Google Scholar databases were collected. After the exclusion of some studies using PRISMA criteria, 16 studies were included for analysis. Content analysis was employed on the selected literature. The review revealed that technology-integrated teaching positively affected students’ academic achievement, attitude toward chemistry, and retention capacity. The review result also confirmed that similar benefits were observed from both male and female students in technology-based instruction. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research gaps observed in the field of the impacts of technology-integrated teaching on students’ achievement, attitude, and retaining chemistry content. Thus, it is likely to conclude that technology-integrated chemistry instruction improves students’ academic achievement, attitude, and retention capacity. It is also possible to conclude that technology-based instruction is gender-friendly. Most of the research has been done in high school using a quasi-experimental design, the researchers recommended that further research in middle schools on different chemistry topics using different research designs (e.g., Design-Based Research) in doing research in this area. },

Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria, 17 of which have children and/or adolescents as participants, and 12 have a non-gifted control group.

The most investigated comorbidity was attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A univocal conclusion on the relationship between intellectual giftedness and socio-emotional/behavioral problems cannot be drawn, principally because of the heterogeneity of participants’ age, informants, and instruments. The review highlights the need for future studies to use multi-informant and comprehensive assessments, to reach more robust findings, and suggests that age and discrepancy between verbal and non-verbal intellectual abilities should be considered critical factors. },

For this, a quasi-experimental design has been used with an accidental sample of 541 students from public centers in the province of Pontevedra (Spain). The instruments used were a School Motivation Scale and an EI questionnaire for primary school students, based on the five areas of Goleman EI. The results maintain a mid to high level of EI in all of the factors (self-conscience, self-control, emotional use, empathy and social skills) and a good level of academic motivation. Therefore, they show a positive and significant correlation of both variables. Girls have a higher emotional intelligence index and there is no difference in academic motivation in terms of gender. Based on these results, it is suggested to implement programs that consolidate emotional competences given their importance in the psychoevolutionary development of students and their relationship with academic motivation. },

The CIP was prepared by adopting a dynamic assessment approach to improve the performance of students with expert support. This improvement would be provided by the clues and feedback given during the intervention within the scope of the CIP. The sample of the study included 173 students in the 5–6 age group (83 experimental group, 90 control group).

The digital application of the Anadolu-Sak Intelligence Scale (d-ASIS) and Raven’s colored progressive matrices (RCPM) were applied to both the experimental and control groups as pretests and posttests. The increases in the intelligence scores of the experimental and control groups were analyzed by MANOVA. The analysis showed that the intelligence levels of the experimental group increased significantly more than the control group in terms of both d-ASIS and RCPM total gain scores (posttest to pretest). This result indicated that the CIP, which was developed by adopting a dynamic assessment approach, supported cognitive development. },

In addition to participating in the study, AI—specifically OpenAI’s ChatGPT—was used to create two of the three survey instruments and served as an analysis tool for the qualitative results of this mixed-methods study. Results from the qualitative data suggest that secondary science educators are cautiously optimistic about the inclusion of AI in the classroom; however, there is a need to modify teacher preparation to incorporate AI training. Further, ethical concerns were identified about plagiarism, knowledge generation, and what constitutes original thinking with AI use. A one-way ANOVA revealed that there was a significant effect of subject taught on attitudes towards AI in the classroom p &lt; 0.05 level for the four conditions: F(3, 23) = 6.743, p = .002. The partial eta squared of 0.47 indicates a large effect size with practical significance. This study serves as an artifact of knowledge about knowledge at the beginning of a technological revolution. },

  abstract={ In this article, we will try to present from an academic point of view some of the relevant characteristics of both artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC) in order to explore the possibility of a meaningful cooperation between both areas of computer science (CS). The quantum part of this paper is based on “The Quantum Circuit Model” which, in the opinion of the author, could be easier understood by computer scientists and/or artificial intelligence researchers, rather than other approaches such as, for example, “Adiabatic Quantum Computation”. Many fundamental questions will arise along this paper for which we will need to give an answer in order to analyze the basic principles that allow researchers and engineers to put AI and QC working together. With this in mind, we will briefly describe the behavior of the biological brain focusing on the identification of the singularities that allow them to perform in such an efficient manner. Energy consumption and parallelism are in the core of the above-mentioned efficiency. Then we will present some of the well-established artificial intelligence approaches that are potentially related to the operation of biological brains. After identifying common characteristics we will introduce basic concepts and issues related to the so-called reversible computing and QC that may eventually help to increase the efficiency of our current intelligent systems. In this respect, we will pay special attention to ‘speed’ and ‘energy consumption’. Some examples, as well as an outline of algorithms from both quantum computing and artificial intelligence, will be used to illustrate the ideas presented in the paper. We conclude with a discussion about what can we expect from the cooperation between both, apparently unconnected fields of computer science, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. },

  abstract={ The objective is to present a proposal for a gender-sensitive risk analysis model using artificial intelligence (AI) within the framework of complex thinking that provides access to opportunities, specifically for vulnerable populations such as women from underprivileged sections. This international non-parametric study highlights the vulnerability of this population in Mexico through a sample of 2787 women. The methodological design included data analysis, the postulation of a proposed model, and a validation method for the credit risk analysis model. There is a correlation between the level of schooling of impoverished and vulnerable women with the possibility of self-employment and selling a product or service. In the framework of complex thinking, the perception of innovative thinking is related to the level of education and innovative decision-making in professional projects. Women with a higher level of schooling tend to think about their professional projects systematically. Promoting complex thinking involves innovative educational practices to encourage critical, systemic, scientific, and innovative thinking in entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Integrating reasoning for complexity benefits women and contributes to economic and social growth in vulnerable regions. In contrast to other models, our credit risk analysis model uses AI and variables for gender, vulnerability, and complex thinking to detect patterns in women's behaviors and attitudes in the venture start-up process. Our proposal is the starting point of many analyses to develop further about artificial intelligence based on complex thinking. },

This article examined these hypotheses. Participants included (n = 280) students from the social sciences (psychology &amp; sociology) and basic sciences (physics &amp; math). The participants filled out the CART tasks to assess the RQ, and the WAIS-III to assess the IQ. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that IQ and RQ are two factors but positively and significantly correlated. In addition, there was no significant difference among the students with high and low IQs in intellectual errors and biases (RQ) despite Stanovich’s hypothesis. },

  abstract={ The centralized control of traffic signals is a challenging problem due to the high randomness and complexity of traffic flow on urban road networks and the interaction between intersections. Centralized control leads to high spatial dimensionality of joint actions for traffic road network signal control. However, the decisive action output can solve the problem of “dimensional explosion” caused by joint actions. In this paper, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based algorithm for centralized control of urban traffic road network signals. We simplify the traffic signal control to a four-phase green signal ratio, and the deep deterministic policy gradient-based algorithm deterministically outputs the control signal for each intersection based on the information of the whole traffic network, thus avoiding the problem of “dimensional explosion”. In particular, a new normalization function is proposed to generate the green rate of traffic signals and constrain it to a range of maximum and minimum sustained green time by linear transformation, which makes the generated traffic signals more realistic. Our proposed algorithm is shown to be optimal and robust compared to Deep Q-Network(DQN) based and fixed time control for 7-hour SUMO simulation of a single-peak traffic network with three intersections. },

  abstract={ The popularization of neuroscientific ideas about learning—sometimes legitimate, sometimes merely commercial—poses a real challenge for classroom teachers who want to understand how children learn. Until teacher preparation programs are reconceived to incorporate relevant research from the neuro- and cognitive sciences, teachers need translation and guidance to effectively use information about the brain and cognition. Absent such guidance, teachers, schools, and school districts may waste time and money pursuing so called “brain-based” interventions that lack a firm basis in research. Meanwhile, the success of our schools will continue to be narrowly defined by achievement standards that ignore knowledge of the neural and cognitive processes of learning. To achieve the goals of neuroeducation, its proponents must address unique ethical issues that neuroeducation raises for five different groups of individuals: a) practicing teachers, b) neuroscience researchers whose work could inform education, c) publishers and the popular media, d) educational policy-makers, and e) university-level teacher educators. We suggest ways in which these ethical challenges can be met and provide a model for teacher preparation that will enable teachers themselves to translate findings from the neuro-and cognitive sciences and use legitimate research to inform how they design and deliver effective instruction. },

On the foundations of the exceptional advances in AI technologies in the last decade, the potential for competitive advantages makes AI in general and Generative AI in particular one of the most promising technologies for marketing. However, while there are robust theoretical advances in the domain of AI for marketing, how AI impacts marketing entities is poorly understood. Further, how AI potentially makes marketing entities ineffective and inefficient is rarely addressed in research. Therefore, in this research, we begin with the articulation of a theory toolkit relevant to AI for marketing. Second, we discuss different types of AI and introduce a new perspective on approaching AI for marketing entities and purposes. Specifically, we conceptualize three new types of AI: enabling AI, engaging AI, and ersatzing AI (artificial, but inferior intelligence that make marketing entities less capable). Third, using our typology, we explicate the enormous potential of the three specific types of AI for marketing. Finally, toward actualizing the potential of AI for marketing, we conclude with a discussion of the contributions of our research and a research agenda. },

To date, however, there exists little empirical evidence regarding their interaction to predict L2 teachers’ technology adoption in Asian countries. To bridge this gap, this quantitative study collected data through three questionnaires from a sample of 214 Chinese English as foreign language (EFL) teachers. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) and regression analysis revealed that both EI and self-efficacy could, respectively, predict 89% and 63% of variances in Chinese EFL teachers’ technology adoption. Drawing on the obtained results, some conclusions, implications, and directions for future research are presented to avid researchers and educators to heighten their knowledge of educational technology and emotions.

  abstract={ With the rapid development of science and technology, there are many derivatives of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology based on wireless networks in the field of education, including intelligent learning systems. The learning strategy of English listening and speaking ability based on the intelligent learning system is studied to improve students’ English listening and speaking ability effectively. Firstly, the literature analysis method is used to analyze the problems that need attention in cultivating English listening and speaking abilities. Then, the current situation of students’ English listening and speaking learning is investigated through questionnaire surveys. Also, the problems existing in the learning process are sorted out and analyzed. Next, the feasibility of applying the intelligent learning system based on the AI wireless network to learning English listening and speaking ability is studied. A feasible strategy based on the intelligent learning system is proposed. Finally, based on the proposed strategy, the class with relatively poor English listening and speaking ability is used as the experimental object for experimental teaching. In addition, the data in the experimental process and the test before and after the experiment are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the intelligent learning system in improving English listening and speaking ability. The results show that the learning strategy of an intelligent learning system based on an AI wireless network can effectively improve English listening and speaking ability and enhance students’ interest in learning English listening and speaking. The average listening ability of the students after the experiment is higher than that of 4.65 points before the experiment, the significance is 0.406 &gt; 0.05, and the significant value in the homogeneous variance test is F = 0.045 &lt; 0.05. The results indicate that there is a significant difference in the listening and speaking ability of the students before and after the experiment, and the listening and speaking ability of the students in the experimental group is significantly improved. Students have a high degree of recognition of the English listening and speaking learning system. This paper provides new ideas for applying and expanding AI technology in English teaching. },

A workshop on teaching with emotional intelligence was designed and conducted three times. One month after, a sample of workshop participants (N = 18) was selected through purposive sampling and their experiences of clinical teaching with emotional intelligence were described using focus groups (n = 3) and deductive content analysis. A model consisting of four themes: preparation and start communication before round, sustained communication during rounds, promotion after the round, and managing social interactions throughout the presence in the ward were presented for describing clinical teachers’ experiences. In this study, a model for using emotional intelligence in clinical setting was extracted. This model can be used in faculty development programs. A suggestion for future research is to examine the effect of using the model on learning outcomes and patient care. },

Zohar introduced the term spiritual intelligence (SI) in 1997, and since that time researchers have been seeking to clarify the concept. Emmons (The psychology of ultimate concerns. Guilford Press, New York, 1999) suggested that SI serves as a potentially significant construct to expand our understanding of the psychological determinants of human functioning. In recent years, several efforts to conceptualize and measure this construct have joined the body of related literature, of which King (Brighter paths to wellbeing: an integrative model of human intelligence and health. Trent University Centre for Health Studies Showcase, pp 12–13, 2008) serves as one notable example. Following, evaluating, and summarizing the theoretical debate regarding the validity of a concept, as it is presented in the literature, has long been understood as a helpful way of extending scholarly dialogue. In this project, I review psychological literature relevant to the debate on the validity of SI as a psychological construct. The literature offers many examples that demonstrate a relation between SI and other phenomena that are important for human functioning—well-being in this. Results of the analysis support theoretical considerations for viewing SI as facilitating the ability to search for the meaning of life and provide directions for future study. },

Researchers in this field are faced with knowledge-based value dynamics, changing environments and uncertainty. Knowledge assets are embedded capabilities in individuals, organizations or societies. This research is focused on the design of artifacts that enhance Intelligence Capital. Intelligence, understood in a comprehensive manner, is a knowledge asset that leverages adaptive capabilities through information gathering, sense-making and adaptation. From this approach, developing Intelligence Capital means to increase adaptive capabilities to make better decisions supported on internal and external knowledge. The purpose of this research is to apply the Intelligence Capital framework to a Technology Development Centre at the Tecnologico de Monterrey. It is expected that through this intervention, Intelligence Capital capabilities of this Centre can be assessed and managed.

However, the links between EI and faculty incivility (FI), and in particular uncivil behaviours perpetrated by faculty towards students in academic settings, remain unmapped. Similarly, the role of gender with respect to such links have yet to be examined. Thus, the current study examined the relationships between EI and perceived FI towards students as a function of gender. The research was conducted among 210 undergraduate students from one major college in Israel. High scores in the SEA EI branch were correlated with reduced FI perceptions among female students but not among male students. However, the links between general EI scores and perceived FI toward students did not indicate any gender effect. },

We found that (a) most National Science Teacher Association journals’ science literacy recommendations have weak or no evidence base and (b) those with evidence reference teaching journals, teacher resource books, and literacy education more often than science education research.

Paul Howard-Jones shows how fact became distorted into popular neuromyth by biases and cultural conditions that largely remain, threatening current attempts at authentic dialogue between neuroscience and education. For several decades, myths about the brain — neuromyths — have persisted in schools and colleges, often being used to justify ineffective approaches to teaching. Many of these myths are biased distortions of scientific fact. Cultural conditions, such as differences in terminology and language, have contributed to a 'gap' between neuroscience and education that has shielded these distortions from scrutiny. In recent years, scientific communications across this gap have increased, although the messages are often distorted by the same conditions and biases as those responsible for neuromyths. In the future, the establishment of a new field of inquiry that is dedicated to bridging neuroscience and education may help to inform and to improve these communications. },

The current study aimed to adapt the Contextual Achievement Motivation Measure (CAMM) developed in English to the Turkish language. The Contextual Achievement Motivation Measure, unlike other achievement motivation scales in literature, measures achievement motivation in school, workplace, community, and family contexts. Since no scale measures contextual achievement motivation in Turkish literature, the current study is important. Three hundred thirty-six first-year college students participated in the study. According to the CFA analysis, the Turkish form of CAMM has preserved its original structure consisting of 21 items and 4 factors (school, workplace, family, community). The error covariance between items 5 and 11, and 3 and 9 were correlated to improve the model. The reliability coefficient for the overall subscale score was .88 based on Cronbach’s alpha reliability analysis. Measurement invariance analysis indicated that the scale scores were partially invariant for male and female participants. The current study will not only contribute to the studies in the field of achievement motivation in Turkiye but will also help to understand international motivation studies culturally, linguistically, and geographically in the fields of counselling, education, and psychology. },

As a school choice option, charter schools that incorporate an Afrocentric approach are more prevalent in large urban school systems disproportionately populated by African-American children and youth. This study examined available data on the performance of Afrocentric charter schools based on their standardized statewide adequate yearly progress (AYP) status. Using systematic research methodology, a keyword search of research databases and internet search engines, 27 Afrocentric charter schools in the USA were identified. Twenty three of the schools met the criteria for analysis, and only 34&nbsp;% of those schools achieved or exceeded statewide standards in testing and met their state’s AYP goals. Implications for future studies are discussed. The research team contends that Afrocentric charter schools must gain greater legitimacy, using standardized accountability measures, in order to become a credible school choice option to failing urban public schools. },

  abstract={ In recent decade, learning analytics has gained more attention and several advanced data mining models are developed for deriving the hidden sources from educational databases. The extracted data helps the Educational Institutions or Universities to enhance the teaching methodologies of faculties and student’s learning process in efficient manner. For improving the student performance and better educational results, the student data evaluations based on their learning modes are significant. With that note, the proposed model develops a new model called ensemble based two-level student classification model (ESCM) for effectively analysing and classifying the student data. With the student data pursuing technical higher education, the ESCM is performed with three traditional classification model and ensemble classifier techniques for enhancing the classification accuracy. The model utilizes support vector machine, Naive Bayesian and J48 classifier that are combined with Ensemble classification methods as modified meta classifier such as bagging and Stacking. Here, the technical higher education student data collected from SRM student database based on the feature set contains the student learning factors that support performance enhancement. The results are evaluated with the SRM student datasets and compared based on the classification accuracy and model reliability. Furthermore, the obtained results outperform the existing models. Based on the accurate predictions, special attentions and measures are taken to improve the student results and institutional reputation. },

  abstract={ Emotional intelligence (EI) is widely known to be crucial for professional development in education, and it is a curricular component of Greek teacher education. Still, there is little information available on student teachers’ EI. The aim of this study was to explore whether student teachers’ trait EI can be developed through a two-week, EI-focused intervention. The study followed a quasi-experimental design with a mixed method approach, using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (Greek version) (N&nbsp;= 42) and reflective emotion diaries (N&nbsp;= 19). The participants were third-year undergraduate students studying primary education and teaching at the University of Crete. While the results from the statistical analysis showed no development of student teachers’ trait EI, the findings from the thematic analysis of the reflective emotion diaries suggested that this intervention was beneficial, facilitating emotion identification and potentially enabling emotion regulation through increased self-awareness. The study concludes with a discussion of its limitations and practical implications for future intervention studies on EI. },

In a unique perspective, this study examined the mediating roles of self-efficacy belief dimensions in the relationship between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial intention of Electrical/Electronics Technology Education (EETE) students. The study was carried out among 192 EETE university students in 4 federal universities in South-East Nigeria. The hypothesized causal relationships based on literature were tested using covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). Andrew Hayes’ PROCESS plugin in SPSS was used to simultaneously estimate the mediating effects of the self-efficacy components (perceived competence, perceived control, and perceived persistence). Data analysis results revealed that emotional intelligence had a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial intention in isolation, while the direct effect of emotional intelligence in the structural (mediation) model was not significant. Out of the three dimensions of self-efficacy, perceived competence and perceived persistence had significant partial mediating effects. The implications of the findings and recommendations were discussed. },

The Sampling group of this study consists of 1,719 persons who are mountaineers/rock climbers (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;426, $$ \overline{\text{X}} $$ age&nbsp;=&nbsp;36.12&nbsp;±&nbsp;10.10), cyclists (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;373, $$ \overline{\text{X}} $$ age&nbsp;=&nbsp;31.36&nbsp;±&nbsp;9.73), trekkers (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;382, $$ \overline{\text{X}} $$ age&nbsp;=&nbsp;39.92 SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;10.30) and non participants in outdoor activities (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;538, $$ \overline{\text{X}} $$ age&nbsp;=&nbsp;31.78&nbsp;±&nbsp;11.47). The exact number of mountaineers/rock climbers, cyclists and trekkers in Turkey is not known. In this study, sampling has been applied and an electronic questionnaire form has been sent to all members of mountaineering and cycling clubs under Turkish Mountaineering Federation and Turkish Cycling Federation. All the received survey answers have been assessed. Non participants of outdoor activities were selected randomly. To determine the EQ and LS level of Turkish mountaineers/rock climbers, cyclists, trekkers and the persons who are not interested in any of the outdoor activities, the Satisfaction with Life Scale which was developed by Diener et al. (J Person Assess 49:71–75, 1985) and during the assessment of EQ dimensions the scale by Chan (Pers Individ Differ 36: 1781–1795, 2004; Teach Teach Educ 22:1042–1054, 2006) was utilized. This study is a descriptive and a definitive research which uses Regression Model for LS and in order to analyze the data, the descriptive statistics such as frequency (f), percentage (%), average (M) and standard deviation (SD) were performed. As a result of this study, it was found that being a participant in outdoor activities as cycling, trekking and mountaineering/rock climbing, having a high monthly income, and being a woman, being coupled and/or married, being occupied, capability on emotion assessment and positive emotional management have positive impacts on LS and being a man, being single, being older, and emotions positively have negative impacts on LS. },

A clinical sample of 39 participants (66.7% female) completed measures of SI and depression before receiving treatment for depression in an outpatient mental health clinic. Results indicated that overall, there was a negative relationship between SI and depression symptoms (r(39) = − 0.55, p &lt; .001); our findings illustrate that this beneficial relationship was driven by women. Future research of interventions aimed at improving spirituality as a means of reducing depression symptoms is warranted. },

In this paper, I concentrate on the way radical views on cognition define themselves as revolutionary theories in cognitive science. These theories often use the Kuhnian concepts of “paradigm” and “paradigm shift” for describing their ambitions and the current situation in cognitive science. I examine whether the use of Kuhn’s theory of science is appropriate here. There might be good reasons to think that cognitive science is in a situation of foundational crisis, but that does not entail that the classical paradigm (computationalism) is currently displaced to the benefit of a new paradigm. Larry Laudan’s theory of research traditions is more enlightening than Kuhn’s theory for describing the scope and ambitions of radical views on cognition, and their relations with an anti-intellectualist tradition in philosophy. },

Thus, while innovation proceeds, SLEs are receiving growing attention from the research community, outputs from which are discussed in this paper. Likewise, this broad application of educational digital technologies is also the remit of standardization in an ISO committee, also discussed in this paper. These two communities share a common interest in, conceptualizing this emerging domain with the aim to identifying direction to further development. In doing so, terminology issues arise along with key questions such as, ‘how is smart learning different from traditional learning?’ Presenting a bigger challenge is the question, ‘how can standardization work be best scoped in today's innovation-rich, networked, cloud-based and data-driven learning environments?’ In responding, this conceptual paper seeks to identify candidate constructs and approaches that might lead to stable, coherent and exhaustive understanding of smart learning environments, thereby providing standards development for learning, education and training a needed direction. Based on reviews of pioneering work within smart learning, smart education and smart learning environments we highlight two models, a cognitive smart learning model and a smartness level model. These models are evaluated against current standardization challenges in the field of learning, education and training to form the basis for a development platform for new standards in this area. },

The college admissions system may produce confusion in Taiwan. Schools in metropolitan areas retain an advantage for screening talent across multiple abilities, and colleges in agricultural counties may unintentionally marginalize people, resulting in insufficient enrollment or an inverse selection of talent. It has been suggested that increasing the number of schools in metropolitan areas will reduce the rates of enrollment failure and improve the compulsory education environment that many are forced to attend. },

The future preschool teachers’ training seems to be focused on the teaching and learning aspects of artistic education however they receive little training on methodologies and philosophies. Therefore, when teachers have to face the classroom, the methodologies they use are usually quite traditional and do not favour the development of critical thinking skills in the students. There are different philosophies of arts education that might embed opportunities for reflection, art interpretation, experimentation, expression of emotions and feelings that if, in the case these philosophies, reach the classroom, may doubtlessly enrich the student’s artistic training. Thus a conceptual framework based on one of these philosophies, named Reggio Emilia, arises. A systematic review of the literature which has been developed by categorising criteria from research papers and from examples of good practices. This categorisation might allow us to establish a framework that can be useful in the classrooms and can establish parameters of action that may have an impact on students, teachers and teachers’ practice in general. },

  abstract={ While deductive validity provides the limiting upper bound for evaluating the strength and quality of inferences, by itself it is an inadequate tool for evaluating arguments, arguing, and argumentation. Similar remarks can be made about rhetorical success and dialectical closure. Then what would count as ideal argumentation? In this paper we introduce the concept of cognitive compathy to point in the direction of one way to answer that question. It is a feature of our argumentation rather than my argument or your argument. In that respect, compathy is like the harmonies achieved by an accomplished choir, the spontaneous coordination of athletic teamwork, or the experience of improvising jazz musicians when they are all in the flow together. It is a characteristic of arguments, not a virtue that can be attributed to individual arguers. It makes argumentation more than just the sum of its individual parts. The concept of cognitive compathy is brought into focus by locating it at the confluence of two lines of thought. First, we work up to the concept of compathy by contrasting it with empathy and sympathy in the context of emotions, which is then transplanted into epistemic, cognitive, and argumentative soil. Second, the concept is analytically linked to ideal argumentation by way of authenticity in communication. In the final section, we explore the extent to which argumentative virtues are conducive to producing compathetic argumentation, but reach the unhappy conclusion that the extra value of compathetic argumentation also transcends the evaluative reach of virtue argumentation theory. },

  abstract={ It was 126&nbsp;years ago that Down first described savant syndrome as a specific condition and 70&nbsp;years ago that Kanner first described Early Infantile Autism. While as many as one in ten autistic persons have savant abilities, such special skills occur in other CNS conditions as well such that approximately 50&nbsp;% of cases of savant syndrome have autism as the underlying developmental disability and 50&nbsp;% are associated with other disabilities. This paper sorts out realities from myths and misconceptions about both savant syndrome and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that have developed through the years. The reality is that low IQ is not necessarily an accompaniment of savant syndrome; in some cases IQ can be superior. Also, savants can be creative, rather than just duplicative, and the skills increase over time on a continuum from duplication, to improvisation to creation, rather than diminishing or suddenly disappearing. Genius and prodigy exist separate from savant syndrome and not all such highly gifted persons have Asperger’s Disorder. This paper also emphasizes the critical importance of separating ‘autistic-like’ symptoms from ASD especially in children when the savant ability presents as hyperlexia (children who read early) or as Einstein syndrome (children who speak late), or have impaired vision (Blindisms) because prognosis and outcome are very different when that careful distinction is made. In those cases the term ‘outgrowing autism’ might be mistakenly applied when in fact the child did not have ASD in the first place. },

  abstract={ Education quality has become an important issue and has received considerable attention around the world, especially due to its relevant repercussions on the socio-economical development of society. In recent years, many nations have realized the need for a highly skilled workforce to thrive in the emerging knowledge-based economy. They have consequently adopted strategies to identify the lines of action to improve the education quality. In response to the government’s efforts to improve the education quality in Colombia, this study examines the current perceptions of the education system from the perspective of key local stakeholders. Therefore, we used a survey that contained open-ended questions to collect information about the limitations and difficulties of the education process for several groups of participants. The collected answers were categorized into a variety of topics using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation based model. Consequently, the students’, teachers’ and parents’ answers were analyzed separately to obtain a general landscape of the perceptions of the education system. Evaluation metrics, such as topic coherence, were quantitatively analyzed to assess the modelling performance. In addition, a methodology for the hyper-parameters setting and the final topic labelling was presented. The results suggest that topic modelling strategies are a viable alternative to identify strategic lines of action and to obtain a macro-perspective of the perceptions of the education system. },

  abstract={ This paper is the first in a two-part work, where the investigation into the characteristics of multiple machine processes is made in order to accurately control them via the frequently used machine centre platform. The two machining processes under investigation are grinding and hole making: for grinding anomalies, grinding burn and chatter and for hole making, drilling, increased tool wear and onset of drill tool malfunction, which is also significant to severe scoring and material dragging. Most researchers usually report on one machining process as opposed to multiple which is less consistent with automated flexible systems where more than one machining process must be catered for. For efficient monitoring of automated multiple manufacturing processes, any unwanted anomalies should be identified and dealt with in a prompt and seamless manner. This first part provides two experimental set-ups (same set-up with tool interchange) to obtain signal signatures for both grinding and drilling phenomena (using the same material). Here, an approach based on neural networks and CARTs is used to reliably detect anomalies for both processes using a single acquisition path, opening the door for control implementation. },

  abstract={ The construction of digital museum is the inevitable trend of the development of museum cause. At present, there are some problems in the construction of digital museum in China, such as backward concept, low overall level, lack of funds and talents. Digital museum is a museum that uses digital and network technology to present the functions of physical museum on the network in a digital way. It includes three parts: the on-site digital display system of the museum exhibition hall, the museum business management system based on network digital technology and the network platform display system. This paper designs and implements a new intelligent digital museum system based on the hybrid reality technology. Compared with the existing digital museum navigation mode, the system gets rid of the tedious way of navigation, provides tourists with more diverse and realistic cultural relics information, and makes the human–computer interaction more humanized. The museum construction in the future will continue to be digital, networked and intelligent, which provides a good practice platform and a broad development world for the improvement and application of new technologies. Besides, the software-driven data collection and analysis models are combined for the systematic performance improvement of the model. The comparison experiment has shown that the proposed model is efficient. },

Improper functioning of this organ due to neurological disorders or surgeries can greatly affect the daily activities performed by patients. This paper aims to comprehensively review soft and rigid wearable robotic devices provided for rehabilitation and assistance focusing on the shoulder joint. In the last two decades, many devices have been proposed in this regard, however, there have been a few groups whose devices have had effective therapeutic capability with acceptable clinical evidence. Also, there were not many portable, lightweight and user-friendly devices. Therefore, this comprehensive study could pave the way for achieving optimal future devices, given the growing need for these devices. According to the results, the most commonly used plan was Exoskeleton, the most commonly used actuators were electrical, and most devices were considered to be stationary and rigid. By doing these studies, the advantages and disadvantages of each method are also presented. The presented devices each have a new idea and attitude in a specific field to solve the problems of movement disorders and rehabilitation, which were in the form of prototypes, initial clinical studies and sometimes comprehensive clinical and commercial studies. These plans need more comprehensive clinical trials to become a complete and efficient plan. This article could be used by researchers to identify and evaluate the important features and strengths and weaknesses of the plans to lead to the presentation of more optimal plans in the future. },

By controlling the etching process, monolayer MoS2 with uniform morphology can be obtained. The Raman and photoluminescence spectra of the resulting material were similar to those of exfoliated MoS2. Utilizing this strategy, different patterns such as a Hall bar structure and a hexagonal array can be realized. Furthermore, the etching mechanism was studied by introducing graphene as an etching mask. We believe our technique opens an easy and controllable way of etching MoS2, which can be used to fabricate complex nanostructures, such as nanoribbons, quantum dots, and transistor structures.

Specifically, I show that many of the early pioneers of AI were cognitive scientists who also made pioneering and impactful contributions to the field of education. These researchers saw AI as a tool for thinking about human learning and used their understanding of how people learn to further AI. Furthermore, I trace two distinct approaches to thinking about cognition and learning that pervade the early histories of AI and education. Despite their differences, researchers from both strands were united in their quest to simultaneously understand and improve human and machine cognition. Today, this perspective is neither prevalent in AI nor the learning sciences. I conclude with some thoughts on how the artificial intelligence in education and learning sciences communities might reinvigorate this lost perspective. },

Finding proper diets is the first important step for intensive aquaculture of this sea cucumber. In this study, adult C. frondosa were exposed to one of the following diet treatments: control (no diet provided), two powdered seaweeds (Ascophyllum nodosum and Saccharina latissima), a commercially available microalgal diet (shellfish diet) and natural seston. The effects of diets on the feeding behavior and physiological properties of sea cucumbers were investigated after a 5-week rearing period. Results show that sea cucumbers fed with shellfish diet exhibited a significantly higher tentacle insertion rate (1.80±0.20 insertion/min) than these fed with seaweed powders, and there was no significant different between the two groups fed by seaweed powders. No significant difference was found on the fecal production rate among the feeding groups. The minimum oxygen consumption rate was observed in the control group (5.76±0.99 μg O 2/(g·h)), which is significantly lower than individuals fed with A. nodosum, shellfish diet, and natural seston; however, no significant difference was shown between those of control and S. latissimi groups. The maximum ammonium excretion rate was found in the A. nodosum group (0.03±0.01 μmol/(g·h)), which is significantly higher than other groups. The minimum O/N ratio was observed in the A. nodosum group (14.57±1.04), which is significantly lower than the S. latissima, shellfish diet, and natural seston groups. Individuals fed with seaweed powders had similar physiological properties with these fed with microalgae diet and natural seston, indicating that A. nodosum and S. latissima can be explored as promising diets for intensive aquaculture of C. frondosa. },

The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis in evolutionary psychology suggests that more intelligent individuals may be more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel values whereas less intelligent individuals may be more likely to hold evolutionarily familiar values. Nationalism is evolutionarily familiar, so the Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis suggests that less intelligent individuals may be more likely to be nationalist. The analyses of the General Social Survey (GSS) data in the US and the National Child Development Study (NCDS) data in the UK confirmed the prediction. Less intelligent Americans were more likely to have nationalist attitudes, and less intelligent British voters were more likely to support nationalist parties in five general elections over three decades. The tendency of less intelligent individuals to be more nationalist and belligerent may, among other things, form the microfoundation of democratic peace in international relations. },

For the students in the synthesis condition, we also examined the relationship between the quality of the synthesis they produced and the comprehension they achieved. 155 psychology undergraduates were randomly assigned either to the reading (n = 78) or to the reading/synthesis condition (n = 77). From this sample, 79 participants carried out the task with the Read&amp;Answer software, and 76 solved the task on paper. All the students took a prior knowledge questionnaire, and read three complementary texts about the conception of intelligence. Students in the reading condition answered an inferential comprehension test, whereas students in the synthesis condition were asked to write a synthesis before taking the same test. Results show no differences in comprehension between students in the four conditions (task and media). There was no significant association between rereading and task condition. However, students in the synthesis condition were more likely to take notes. We found that two of the categories for the quality of the synthesis, textual organization and accuracy of content had an impact on inferential comprehension for the participants who wrote it. The quality of the synthesis mediated between student’s prior knowledge and inferential comprehension. },

Sea cucumbers were fed with five diets containing different amounts of farming waste from shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) (100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0) and a formulated compound (20% sea mud and 80% powdered algae). Sea cucumbers grew faster when they were fed with diet D (25% shrimp waste and 75% formulated compound) than those fed with other diets. Although IR value of sea cucumber fed with diet A (shrimp waste) was higher than those fed with other diets, both the lowest SGR and the highest FCR occurred in this diet group. The highest and the lowest ADR occurred in diet E (formulated compound) and diet A group, respectively, and the same to ammonium-nitrogen excretion. The contents of crude protein, crude lipid and total organic matter (TOM) in feces decreased in comparison with corresponding diets. In the feces from different diet treatments, the contents of crude protein and TOM increased gradually as the contents of crude protein and TOM in diets increased, while crude lipid content decreased gradually as the crude lipid content in diets increased. },

In our view, mathematical giftedness consists of mathematical ability and mathematical creativity, whereas natural/cognitive abilities predict mathematical giftedness. To verify our model, data were collected from 239 elementary school students through four instruments. Data analysis verified the structure of the model, indicating that mathematical ability contributes more than mathematical creativity to the construct of mathematical giftedness. Furthermore, the natural/cognitive abilities (fluid intelligence and working memory) predict mathematical giftedness. Three different groups of students were identified, which reflect three distinct levels of performance, namely, low-, average-,and high-ability students.

  abstract={ Characterizing the neural implementation of abstract conceptual representations has long been a contentious topic in cognitive science. At the heart of the debate is whether the “sensorimotor” machinery of the brain plays a central role in representing concepts, or whether the involvement of these perceptual and motor regions is merely peripheral or epiphenomenal. The domain of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning provides an important proving ground for sensorimotor (or grounded) theories of cognition, as concepts in science and engineering courses are often taught through laboratory-based and other hands-on methodologies. In this review of the literature, we examine evidence suggesting that sensorimotor processes strengthen learning associated with the abstract concepts central to STEM pedagogy. After considering how contemporary theories have defined abstraction in the context of semantic knowledge, we propose our own explanation for how body-centered information, as computed in sensorimotor brain regions and visuomotor association cortex, can form a useful foundation upon which to build an understanding of abstract scientific concepts, such as mechanical force. Drawing from theories in cognitive neuroscience, we then explore models elucidating the neural mechanisms involved in grounding intangible concepts, including Hebbian learning, predictive coding, and neuronal recycling. Empirical data on STEM learning through hands-on instruction are considered in light of these neural models. We conclude the review by proposing three distinct ways in which the field of cognitive neuroscience can contribute to STEM learning by bolstering our understanding of how the brain instantiates abstract concepts in an embodied fashion. },

The polymer concentration in the organic solvent after the polycondensation reaction was controlled to be 10 wt%. The cyPPTA-based polymers with higher cyano-monomer contents were found to have higher intrinsic viscosity and number-average molecular weight owing to their increased solubility in the polymerization solutions. The polarized optical microscopic images demonstrated that the polymers with high cyano-monomer contents of 100 and 80 mol% developed liquid crystalline structure in the polymerization solutions, while the polymers with relatively low cyano-monomer contents of 50–70 mol% formed highly condensed crystalline morphology. Consistently, the FT-IR spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns exhibited that the cyPPTA-based polymers with high cyano-monomer contents above 80 mol% have relatively week interchain hydrogen bond and thus form semi-ordered structures, in comparison with the polymer products with low cyano-monomer contents less than 70 mol%. In addition, the cyPPTAs with higher cyano-monomer contents were found to have higher thermal decomposition peak temperatures. },

FT-IR spectra of the composite films revealed the existence of specific interaction between cyPPTA and MWCNT. Accordingly, the pristine MWCNTs were found to be dispersed uniformly in the cyPPTA matrix, as confirmed by TEM images. The electrical resistivity of the composite films decreased considerably from ~1010 Ω cm to ~100 Ω cm with the increase of the MWCNT content by forming a conductive percolation threshold at ~0.525 wt%. The composite films with 3.0-10.0 wt% MWCNT contents, which have sufficiently low electrical resistivity of ~102-100 Ω cm, exhibited excellent electric heating performance by attaining high maximum temperatures and electric power efficiency under given applied voltages of 10-100 V. Since the thermal decomposition of the composite films took place at 520-600 °C under air atmosphere, cyPPTA/MWCNT composite films could be used for high performance electric heating, antistatic, and EMI shielding materials. },

The behavior of the magnetoresistance was attributed to the behavior of the mobility of charge carriers which in its turn depends on thickness and temperature of the nanoflakes. The magnetoresistance of the sample with the thickness of 25 nm shows pronounced weak antilocalization effect (inherent for topological insulators) which is the contribution of surface states to the electronic transport.

  abstract={ An approach to constructing optimal control synthesis, based on studying the allocation of characteristics to the Cauchy problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation (i.e., determining how the extended phase space is filled with these characteristics), is proposed. A method for finding a global solution to the Cauchy problem for the HJB equation by setting boundary conditions on the surface of singular characteristics corresponding to singular optimal controls is developed. Control is considered to be one-dimensional and linear within the system. In describing the method, it is assumed that this surface is unique, and that the switching of any admissible process satisfying Pontryagin’s maximum principle can occur only on it and not more than once. The corresponding sufficient conditions are obtained, and the smoothness of the cost function constructed in this way is verify. The resulting approach is demonstrated via the example of a mathematical model for the treatment of viral infections. },

We extend the compartmental SIR model to explore the trade-offs which govern individual behavior. Our stylized model allows for a closed form analysis of vaccination and lockdown policies. We establish Peltzman effects: as policies lower the risk of infections, people become more socially active, which—in turn—undermines their effectiveness. We detect patterns in data for both US states and countries in Western Europe that are consistent with the notion that such effects are shaping actual infection dynamics to a considerable extent. },

  abstract={ In the present study, the applicability of the wet waste collected from shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) to the culture of sea cucumber (Stichopus monotuberculatus) was determined. The effects of dietary wet shrimp waste on the survival, specific growth rate (SGR), fecal production rate (FPR), ammonia- and nitrite-nitrogen productions of sea cucumber were studied. The total organic matter (TOM) level in the feces of sea cucumber was compared with that in corresponding feeds. Diet C (50% wet shrimp waste and 50% sea mud mash) made sea cucumber grow faster than other diets. Sea cucumber fed with either diet D (25% wet shrimp waste and 75% sea mud mash) or sole sea mud exhibited negative growth. The average lowest total FPR of sea cucumber occurred in diet A (wet shrimp waste), and there was no significant difference in total FPR between diet C and diet E (sea mud mash) (P &gt; 0.05). The average ammonia-nitrogen production of sea cucumber in different diet treatments decreased gradually with the decrease of crude protein content in different diets. The average highest nitrite-nitrogen production occurred in diet E treatment, and there was no significant difference in nitrite-nitrogen production among diet A, diet B (75% wet shrimp waste and 25% sea mud mash) and diet C treatments (P &gt; 0.05). In each diet treatment, the total organic matter (TOM) level in feces decreased to different extent compared with that in corresponding feeds. },

  abstract={ This essay focuses on the idea of the self in everyday life and not on our efforts to construct another self in our striving to be better human beings in a troubled and fragile world. Self-knowledge is an essential process of being in this world in the framework of relatedness. In this context, the work of J. Krishnamurti is essential to our understanding of how we engage with ourselves through observation, listening and looking inwards. Unless we are in a continuous process of this engagement with the self, we are unable to relate to others in a meaningful and significant manner. We remain enclosed, isolated and individual selves. It therefore becomes essential to view self-knowing and the sacred as a part of everyday life and not as some better world to be pursued through ritual and self-improvement aspirational regimes. I further develop the role of education as a transformative process to develop empathy and compassion among children. In doing this, I am not, however, advocating that there is once again a striving for the sacred or a reaching out to a ‘superior’ moral phenomenon to beget a change. We need to be aware of the pedagogic possibilities in the everyday that are opened up through the development of both cognitive and emotional skills to ‘awaken intelligence’ and agency for social transformation. },

It begins with the IB’s 1960s origins in international schools, which educated the children of globally mobile parents who worked principally in the UN and its agencies, and in embassies and multinational companies. Its origin led to its perception as elitist, but it has since been democratised in public (state) schools in quite a number of countries, notably in North America; starting in 2012, the IB offers the IB Career-related Certificate (IBCC) programme for students following vocational courses. Then follows an overview of the four education programmes of the IB, in order of creation: Diploma Programme (1970), Middle Years Programme (1994), Primary Years Programme (1997), and the IB Career-related Certificate (2012). Attributes of a world-class education are suggested: the concept of interdependence between nations, the shaping of attitudes, the relevance of curriculum content and teaching methods, and the importance of including an international perspective. The article concludes with a list of competencies for a world-class education based on the IB Learner Profile. },

  abstract={ This paper reports on a study undertaken with the primary aim of investigating the role of wonder in the learning process. The study was carried out by a 9th grade science teacher in collaboration with a university professor. The teacher taught two classrooms of 27 and 30 students respectively, by trying to evoke a sense of wonder only in one of them. To this end the teacher identified ideas and phenomena as potential sources of wonder and initiated the instruction through these ideas and phenomena. Observation and especially student optional journals were the main instruments of the research. A quantitative analysis of journal entries made by the students of both classrooms, provided evidence for higher involvement for the students—both males and females—of the classroom where the teacher evoked a sense of wonder. Also an analysis of students’ comments provided evidence that wonder, experienced as astonishment and a shock of awareness can help students change their outlook on natural phenomena. Moreover two paper-and-pencil tests administered at the end of the school year provided additional evidence that wonder had an effect on students’ ability to remember “wonder-full” ideas and also an effect on better understanding, of at least, three phenomena. This empirical evidence of better retention and understanding is evidence of the role of wonder as an attention catcher and generally of the role of affective factors in the learning process. },

  abstract={ Infectious diseases generate heterogeneous economic and health impacts within countries, thus it is essential to account for the spatial dimension in the design of epidemic management programs. We analyze the optimal regional policy to contain the spread of a communicable disease in a spatial framework with endogenous determination of the regional borders characterizing which policy regime will prevail. Specifically, the social planner needs to choose how to split the entire spatial economy in a number of regions in which a different combination of lockdown and treatment measures will be employed: in some region the only mitigation instrument will be treatment, while in some other treatment will be accompanied by a partial lockdown. We characterize the optimal solution both in an early and an advanced epidemic setting, showing that according to the circumstances it may be convenient either to partition the spatial economy in multiple regions with differentiated policies or to consider it a unique region subject to the same policy measure. Moreover, we show that from a normative perspective it is rather difficult to understand how to effectively determine the optimal size of a lockdown area (and thus of the lockdown intensity) since this critically depends on a number of factors, including the initial spatial distribution of disease prevalence, the amount of resources diverted from one region to the other, and the possible spatio-temporal evolution of the disease. },

  abstract={ In this paper we propose a time-space economic model to control the evolution and the spread of a disease. The underlying epidemiological model is formulated as a reaction-diffusion integro-differential partial differential equation. This specific model formulation, supported by empirical data, contains three different terms: a pure diffusion term, a linear growth term, and an integral term. These three terms capture different diffusion channels of a transmissible disease: a local diffusion effect, a temporal effect, and a global diffusion effect. The decision maker aims at deciding the optimal effort to be implemented in order to control the number of infections and, at the same time, minimize the cost of treatment. We analyze the finite horizon case in detail and we provide the closed-form expression of the optimal policy to be implemented to control the epidemic while sustaining economic growth. We also propose two different extensions: The first one considers an infinite horizon model while, the second one, is related to a multi-period framework. },

  abstract={ The variation in the rate at which humans age may be rooted in early events acting through the genomic regions that are influenced by such events and subsequently are related to health phenotypes in later life. The parent-of-origin-effect (POE)-regulated methylome includes regions enriched for genetically controlled imprinting effects (the typical type of POE) and regions influenced by environmental effects associated with parents (the atypical POE). This part of the methylome is heavily influenced by early events, making it a potential route connecting early exposures, the epigenome, and aging. We aim to test the association of POE-CpGs with early and later exposures and subsequently with health-related phenotypes and adult aging. We perform a phenome-wide association analysis for the POE-influenced methylome using GS:SFHS (Ndiscovery = 5087, Nreplication = 4450). We identify and replicate 92 POE-CpG-phenotype associations. Most of the associations are contributed by the POE-CpGs belonging to the atypical class where the most strongly enriched associations are with aging (DNAmTL acceleration), intelligence, and parental (maternal) smoking exposure phenotypes. A proportion of the atypical POE-CpGs form co-methylation networks (modules) which are associated with these phenotypes, with one of the aging-associated modules displaying increased within-module methylation connectivity with age. The atypical POE-CpGs also display high levels of methylation heterogeneity, fast information loss with age, and a strong correlation with CpGs contained within epigenetic clocks. These results identify the association between the atypical POE-influenced methylome and aging and provide new evidence for the “early development of origin” hypothesis for aging in humans. },

  abstract={ Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenological philosophy, developed the concept of the so-called pure transcendental consciousness. The author of the article asks whether the concept of consciousness understood this way can constitute a model for AI consciousness. It should be remembered that transcendental consciousness is the result of the use of the phenomenological method, the essence of which is referring to experience (“back to things themselves”). Therefore, one can legitimately ask whether the consciousness that AI can achieve can possess the characteristics attributed by Husserl to pure transcendental consciousness. The answer to such questions seems to be negative because AI, as created by humans, can only operate in the field of phenomena. Human intelligence, however, is capable of operating at the ontological level. In the face of difficulties in understanding the phenomenon of consciousness on a scientific basis, the question arises about the possibility of using the phenomenological concept of consciousness developed by Husserl as a starting point in analyzes aimed at answering the question about AI consciousness (The aim of the article is not to discuss in detail the contemporary state of research on consciousness. Therefore, many results currently achieved mainly in the field of neuroscience are omitted. It is just about indicating the possible application of Husserl’s transcendental concept of consciousness in research on AI consciousness). },

Web design is viewed as a process of ill-structured problem solving that educators can integrate in the curriculum to link content knowledge with the construction of a tangible product. Each of the web design steps, according to these preservice teachers, is important in developing and realizing the creative potential because they require comprehension, analysis, synthesis, application, and evaluation skills to create a unique product. },

Fifty-four tenth grade students from two classes in two different schools took part in the study. They were randomly distributed into an experimental group (n = 27) and control group n = (27). The experimental group was taught reading comprehension following differentiated instruction strategies of homogeneous grouping, tiered assignment and tiered instruction in the areas of content, process and product. The experimental group was supported with modified reading comprehension texts from Action Pack 10, supplementary materials and leveled short stories. The control group was taught in the one-size-fits-all method using Action Pack 10th text books only. The study is a mixed-method design where quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect data. The main objective was to investigate the effect of differentiated instruction on secondary stage. The researchers used the pre-test/post-test scores to collect the quantitative data followed by a student semi-structured interview after the experiment. T-test results revealed that differentiated instruction was effective in increasing reading comprehension achievement for the early secondary stage.

The system stability of this controller is proved by the Lyapunov stability theorem, and it is demonstrated that the Event-trigger strategy proposed in this paper does not have the Zeno phenomenon.

  abstract={ Although learning styles (LS) have been recognised as a neuromyth, they remain a virtual truism within education. A point of concern is that the term LS has been used within theories that describe them using completely different notions and categorisations. This is the first empirical study to investigate education professionals’ conceptualisation, as well as means of identifying and implementing LS in their classroom. A sample of 123 education professionals were administered a questionnaire consisting both closed- and open-ended questions. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. LS were found to be mainly conceptualised within the Visual-Auditory-(Reading)-Kinaesthetic (VAK/VARK) framework, as well as Gardner’s multiple intelligences. Moreover, a lot of education professionals confused theories of learning (e.g., behavioural or cognitive theories) with LS. In terms of identifying LS, educators reported using a variety of methods, spanning from observation and everyday contact to the use of tests. The ways LS were implemented in the classroom were numerous, comprising various teaching aids, participatory techniques and motor activities. Overall, we argue that the extended use of the term LS gives the illusion of a consensus amongst educators, when a closer examination reveals that the term LS is conceptualised, identified and implemented idiosyncratically by different individuals. This study aims to be of use to pre-service and in-service teacher educators in their effort to debunk the neuromyth of LS and replace it with evidence-based practices. },

The CTF acts as the photosensitizer and support material, while the mononuclear Ru-based complex Ru-bda-Isoq acts as a molecular water-oxidation catalyst. Remarkably, Ru-bda-Isoq@CTF-Bph achieves an excellent oxygen evolution rate of up to 2308 µmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation for 5 h. The structural matching between the porous photosensitizer and molecular catalyst is found to play a very critical role in achieving the high performance, and the specificity and universality of this system are also highlighted. This strategy provides valuable insights into the design of efficient water oxidation photocatalytic systems. },

  abstract={ The mechanical behavior of L-shaped steel reinforced concrete (SRC) columns after exposure to high temperatures is investigated by conducting experiments on eight column specimens. The specimens are first heated to a target temperature and are loaded to failure after cooling down to room temperature. The effect of heating duration, loading eccentricities, and loading angles on the temperature distribution, failure mode and residual bearing capacity of the columns is studied. The test results show that L-shaped SRC columns under axial and eccentric loading have a post-high temperature shear and bending failure mode, respectively. The residual bearing capacity of the specimens decreases significantly (up to 1/3) compared to that at room temperature. The residual bearing capacity of L-shaped SRC columns is governed by loading eccentricities, and an eccentricity of 80 mm (0.36) leads to a reduction in residual capacity by 47% of its ambient value. The loading angle has an obvious effect on the damage range of L-shaped SRC columns. A formula for calculating the residual bearing capacity of L-shaped SRC columns under biaxially eccentric compression is proposed and validated against test results. },

The relationship between the spinning rate, chemical structure and the imidization degree of the PI precursor fibers were investigated, and the results indicated a moderate low spinning speed and relatively flexible molecular chains are both favorable for the partial imidization reaction in the spinning process. 2D WAXD results demonstrate that the rigid PDA-based PI fibers possess a higher alignment of polymer chains along the fiber axis during the spinning compared to the flexible ODA-based PIs, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties, with the tensile strength of 1.2-2.8 GPa and modulus of 53.6-111.2 GPa, respectively. Meanwhile, ODA sets of PI fibers exhibit a higher loop strength and knot strength than the commercial Aramid and PBO fibers. The process used in this study has a significant potential for realizing industrial level production of high strength and high modulus PI fibers. },

  abstract={ The presence of the Kerguelen Plateau and surrounding bathymetric features has a strong influence on the persistently eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), resulting in enhancement of surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the downstream section of the plateau along the polar front (PF). The phenomenon is reported in this paper as the island mass effect (IME). Analysis of climatological Chl-a datasets from Aqua- Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Aqua- MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) shows distinct bloomy plumes (Chl-a&gt;0.5 mg/m3) during austral spring-summer spreading as far as ~1800 km offshore up to 98°E along the downstream of the north Kerguelen Plateau (NKP). Similar IME phenomena is apparent over the south Kerguelen Plateau (SKP) with the phytoplankton bloom extending up to 96.7°E, along the southern boundary of ACC. The IME phenomena are pronounced only during austral spring-summer period with the availability of light and sedimentary source of iron from shallow plateau to sea surface that fertilizes the mixed layer. The NKP bloom peaks with a maximum areal extent of 1.315 million km2 during December, and the SKP bloom peaks during January with a time lag of one month. The blooms exist for at least 4 months of a year and are significant both as the base of regional food web and for regulating the biogeochemical cycle in the Southern Ocean. Even though the surface water above the Kerguelen Plateau is rich in Chl-a, an exception of an oligotrophic condition dominated between NKP and SKP due to apparent intrusion of iron limited low phytoplankton regime waters from the Enderby basin through the northeastward Fawn Trough Current. },

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of utilizing Al(OH)3-F generated in Al(OH)3 adsorption (Al(OH)3-Fads) and coagulation (Al(OH)3-Fcoag) for the adsorption of cadmium ion (Cd(II)). The adsorption capacity of Al(OH)3-Fads and Al(OH)3-Fcoag for Cd(II) was similar as that of pristine aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3), being of 24.39 and 19.90 mg·g–1, respectively. The adsorption of Cd(II) onto Al(OH)3-Fads and Al(OH)3-Fcoag was identified to be dominated by ion-exchange with sodium ion (Na+) or hydrogen ion (H+), surface microprecitation, and electrostatic attraction. The maximum concentration of the leached fluoride from Al(OH)3-Fads and Al(OH)3-Fcoag is below the Chinese Class-I IndustrialWastewater Discharge Standard for fluoride (&lt;10 mg·L–1). This study demonstrates that the Al(OH)3 solid wastes generated in fluoride removal process could be potentially utilized as a adsorbent for Cd(II) removal. },

  abstract={ The land use change from natural to managed ecosystems causes serious soil degradation. The main objective of this research was to assess deforestation effects on soil physical quality attributes and soil water retention curve (SWRC) parameters in the Fandoghlou region of Ardabil province, Iran. Totally 36 surface and subsurface soil samples were taken and soil water contents measured at 13 suctions. Alfa (α) and n parameters in van Genuchten (1980) model were estimated by fitting SWRC data by using RETC software. The slope of SWRC at inflection point (SP) was calculated by Dexter (2004) equation. The results indicated that with changing land use from forest (F) to range land (R) and cultivated land (C), and also with increasing soil depth from 0–25 to 75–100 cm in each land use, organic carbon, micropores, saturated and available water contents decreased and macropores and bulk density increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). The position of SWRC shape in F was higher than R and C lands at all soil depths. Changing F to R and C lands and also increasing soil depth in each land use significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased α and decreased n and SP. The average values of SP were obtained 0.093, 0.051 and 0.031 for F, R and C, respectively. As a result, deforestation reduced soil physical quality by affecting SWRC parameters. },

Here we have analyzed 369 viral genomes from recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients in Shanghai, identifying a large number of sublineages of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron family. Phylogenetic analysis, coupled with contact history tracing, revealed simultaneous community transmission of two Omicron sublineages dominating the infections in some areas of China (BA.5.2 mainly in Guangzhou and Shanghai, and BF.7 mainly in Beijing) and two highly infectious sublineages recently imported from abroad (XBB and BQ.1). Publicly available data from August 31 to November 29, 2022 indicated an overall severe/critical case rate of 0.035% nationwide, while analysis of 5706 symptomatic patients treated at the Shanghai Public Health Center between September 1 and December 26, 2022 showed that 20 cases (0.35%) without comorbidities progressed into severe/critical conditions and 153 cases (2.68%) with COVID-19-exacerbated comorbidities progressed into severe/critical conditions. These observations shall alert healthcare providers to place more resources for the treatment of severe/critical cases. Furthermore, mathematical modeling predicts this autumn/winter wave might pass through major cities in China by the end of the year, whereas some middle and western provinces and rural areas would be hit by the upcoming infection wave in mid-to-late January 2023, and the duration and magnitude of upcoming outbreak could be dramatically enhanced by the extensive travels during the Spring Festival (January 21, 2023). Altogether, these preliminary data highlight the needs to allocate resources to early diagnosis and effective treatment of severe cases and the protection of vulnerable population, especially in the rural areas, to ensure the country’s smooth exit from the ongoing pandemic and accelerate socio-economic recovery. },

Elastomeric polyurethanes have been extensively studied as solid-state plasticizer to induce flexibility to otherwise rigid PVC. In this research, bio-based polyurethane (BPU) elastomers and phthalate hybrid plasticizer was used for the fabrication of flexible PVC. Even though half the amount of phthalate plasticizer was replaced with BPU the PVC with the hybrid plasticizer showed strain at break of 320.5 %.

  abstract={ This study investigates the effects of light and temperature on the surface water diatoms and chlorophytes, phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean (SO) during the austral summer of 1998‒2014. Significant longitudinal variations in hydrographic and biological parameters were observed at the Sub tropical front (STF), Sub Antarctic front (SAF) and Polar front (PF) along 56°E‒58°E. The concentrations of total surface chlorophyll a (Chl a), diatoms, and chlorophytes measured by the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) estimated by the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensors (SeaWiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MODIS), and the NASA Ocean Biological Model (NOBM) were used in the study. Variations in the concentration of total Chl a was remarkable amongst the fronts during the study period. The contribution of diatoms to the total concentration of surface Chl a increased towards south from the STF to the PF while it decreased in the case of chlorophytes. The maximum photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was observed at the STF and it progressively decreased to the PF through the SAF. At the PF region the contribution of diatoms to the total Chl a biomass was ≥80%. On the other hand, the chlorophytes showed a contrary distribution pattern with ≥70% of the total Chl a biomass recorded at the STF which gradually decreased towards the PF, mainly attributed to the temperate adaptation. This clearly reveals that the trend of diatoms increased at the STF and decreased at the SAF and the PF. Further, the trend of chlorophytes was increased at the STF, SAF and PF with a shift in the community in the frontal system of the Indian Ocean sector of the SO. },

  abstract={ Depth-integrated long-wave models, such as the shallow-water and Boussinesq equations, are standard fare in the study of small amplitude surface waves in shallow water. While the shallow-water theory features conservation of mass, momentum and energy for smooth solutions, mechanical balance equations are not widely used in Boussinesq scaling, and it appears that the expressions for many of these quantities are not known. This work presents a systematic derivation of mass, momentum and energy densities and fluxes associated with a general family of Boussinesq systems. The derivation is based on a reconstruction of the velocity field and the pressure in the fluid column below the free surface, and the derivation of differential balance equations which are of the same asymptotic validity as the evolution equations. It is shown that all these mechanical quantities can be expressed in terms of the principal dependent variables of the Boussinesq system: the surface excursion η and the horizontal velocity w at a given level in the fluid. },

  abstract={ Learning network dynamics from the empirical structure and spatio-temporal observation data is crucial to revealing the interaction mechanisms of complex networks in a wide range of domains. However, most existing methods only aim at learning network dynamic behaviors generated by a specific ordinary differential equation instance, resulting in ineffectiveness for new ones, and generally require dense observations. The observed data, especially from network emerging dynamics, are usually difficult to obtain, which brings trouble to model learning. Therefore, learning accurate network dynamics with sparse, irregularly-sampled, partial, and noisy observations remains a fundamental challenge. We introduce a new concept of the stochastic skeleton and its neural implementation, i.e., neural ODE processes for network dynamics (NDP4ND), a new class of stochastic processes governed by stochastic data-adaptive network dynamics, to overcome the challenge and learn continuous network dynamics from scarce observations. Intensive experiments conducted on various network dynamics in ecological population evolution, phototaxis movement, brain activity, epidemic spreading, and real-world empirical systems, demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent data adaptability and computational efficiency, and can adapt to unseen network emerging dynamics, producing accurate interpolation and extrapolation with reducing the ratio of required observation data to only about 6% and improving the learning speed for new dynamics by three orders of magnitude. },

The solubility experiments show that the obtained polymers have lower solubility in organic solvents due to their crystallinity which was confirm by X-ray diffraction but have good solubility in NMP solvent. In addition, the polymers exhibit good thermal stability and relatively high T g (glass transition temperature) under N2 (Nitrogen) atmosphere. },

Nirmatrelvir–ritonavir has been recommended by the World Health Organization as an early treatment for outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. However, the existing treatment options have limitations, and effective treatment strategies that are cost-effective and convenient for tackling COVID-19 are still needed.

Cupric chloride pretreated and thermally stabilized polyamide 6 (PA6) fibers was characterized by a reduction in fiber diameter and linear density values together with color changes from light brown to black with increasing stabilization time. PA6 fibers were properly stabilized after 8 h of stabilization time prior to carbonization. The results obtained from DSC and TGA measurements indicated that there was an improvement in the thermal stability when cupric (Cu2+) ions were incorporated into the polymer structure. TGA thermograms showed the relative improvement in thermal stability as indicated by increasing char yield with progressing time. Char yield reached a maximum value of 33.6 % at 1000 °C for the cupric chloride pretreated PA6 fibers stabilized for 12 h at 180 °C. Experimental results obtained from DSC and X-ray diffraction methods suggested the loss of crystallinity as a result of perturbation of hydrogen bonds with progressing time. The formation of cupric ion-amide coordination bonds improved the thermal stabilization by encouraging the development of ladder-like structures. The investigation resulted in a new method of evaluation of X-ray stabilization index specifically intended for the thermally stabilized PA6 fiber. },

In this paper, U. prolifera patches are detected from quasisynchronous satellite images with different spatial resolution, i.e., Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), HJ-1A/B (China Small Satellite Constellation for Environment and Disaster Monitoring and Forecasting), CCD (Charge-Coupled Device), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), and ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite) ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. Two comparative experiments are performed to explore the U. prolifera monitoring abilities by different data using detection methods such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) with different thresholds. Results demonstrate that spatial resolution is an important factor affecting the extracted area of the floating macroalgae. Due to the complexity of Case II sea water characteristics in the Yellow Sea, a fixed threshold NDVI method is not suitable for U. prolifera monitoring. A method with adaptive ability in time and space, e.g., the threshold selection method proposed by Otsu (1979), is needed here to obtain accurate information on the floating macroalgae. },

  abstract={ Dietary hydroxycinnamates are considered as attractive materials for radioprotection. This study explores whether hydroxycinnamates protect against γ-radiation-induced cellular damages and hematopoietic stem cell senescence. C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with each of caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid (20mg/kg body weight) once per three days for five times before exposure to total body radiation (5 Gy). Irradiation increased the activities of alanine amino transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase in blood serum but decreased the anti-oxidant defense enzyme activities in the liver and spleen tissues. Oral administration of the compounds almost completely prevented irradiation-mediated changes in these enzyme activities. The hydroxycinnamates also inhibited the irradiation-mediated increases in the mitochondrial superoxide anions of Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells and CD150+CD48− LSK cells in the bone marrow. These results suggest that dietary hydroxycinnamates protect against irradiation-mediated oxidative damages of tissues and bone marrow progenitor cells. },

  abstract={ The Ningxia region in Northwest China, a significant grain-producing area, heavily relies on the Yellow River for agricultural irrigation. Maintaining the ecological health of the Yellow River is crucial due to its role as the primary water source. This research comprehensively assessed heavy metal (HM) levels in surface water and sediments within the Ningxia section of the Yellow River basin. It specifically examined the concentrations of Sr, Zn, Mn, Cu, As, Cd, Cr, Co, Sb, Pb, Tl, Ni, and Hg, detailing their spatial distribution and associated risks. Sources of pollution were identified, and their relationships were explored using statistical analysis and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The risk assessment results indicated elevated pollution levels of Tl and slight pollution of Hg in surface water. Integrated Nemerow Pollution Index (PN) calculations revealed that 18% and 20% of surface water samples exhibited pollution during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. In sediments, mean concentrations of Mn, As, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cu, Cd, Sr, Co, Sb, and Tl exceeded background levels, with Mn being the highest. Sediments exhibited low to moderate HM pollution, with higher concentrations found in northern Ningxia’s irrigated areas. Major sources of HM pollution included agriculture, traffic emissions, and natural sources. Overall, this study provides essential data to improve water resource management and mitigate HM pollution in the Ningxia section of the Yellow River Basin. },

It is unprecedented in pandemic control history to develop a dozen successful vaccines in the first year and to immunize over half of the global population in the second year, due to the efforts of the scientific community, biopharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies worldwide. The challenges are both great and multidimensional due to the rapid emergence of virus variants and waning of vaccine immunity. Vaccination strategies need to adapt to these challenges to keep population immunity above the herd immunity threshold, by increasing vaccine coverage, especially for older adults and young people, and providing timely booster doses with homologous or heterologous vaccine boosts. Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants and to understand the best prime-boost vaccine combinations and immunization strategies to provide sufficient and sustainable immune protection against COVID-19. },

Turbostratic PPTA-based carbon fibers were produced using a single step procedure in an inert atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1100 °C. In the present study, fiber diameter, mass yield, density, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, tensile testing and electrical conductivity measurements were performed and evaluated to follow and monitor the properties and structural transformations of carbon fibers with rising temperature. The increase of heat-treatment temperature to 1100 °C. decreased the interlayer d-spacing (d002) and increased the in-plane size (La) and thickness (Lc) of the graphene layers. The intensity ratios of D to G bands in the Raman spectra increased with rising temperature, suggesting, in agreement with the X-ray diffraction measurements, that the in-plane size (La) of the graphene planes increased with temperature. The density, carbon content, C/H ratio, apparent crystallite size (La and Lc), electrical conductivity and tensile properties of the resultant carbon fibers were enhanced with rising temperature. It has been shown that the gage length of the carbon fibers tested has a significant effect on the tensile strength obtained. After taking into account the effects of gage length and porosity dependence, the carbonization of PPTA precursor fibers prepared at 1100 °C. gave a tensile strength of 191 MPa and a tensile modulus of 83 GPa, respectively. },

  abstract={ The thermal stabilization stage of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is characterized by a steady and continuous reduction in fiber diameter and linear density values together with color changes from reddish brown to shiny black with increasing stabilization time. Thermally stabilized PAN fibers acquire infusible and nonburning characteristics prior to the carbonization stage. Structural characterization of thermally stabilized polyacrylonitrile fibers was carried out using an indepth analysis of equatorial X-ray diffraction traces. Curve fitting of X-ray diffraction traces provided accurate peak parameters which were subsequently used for the evaluation of apparent crystallinity, apparent crystallite size and X-ray stabilization index. The results showed the loss of crystallinity due to the amorphization processes together with a steady and continuous decrease in lateral crystallite size with increasing stabilization time. With the progress of thermal stabilization, a new amorphous phase with a crosslinked and aromatized structure is formed which is expected to withstand high carbonization temperatures. Mechanical properties of the thermally stabilized PAN precursor fibers were found to be adversely affected with the progress of stabilization time. Due to the influence of thermal degradation mechanisms heavily involving chain scission along the fiber axis direction, tensile strength and tensile modulus values were found to decrease by significant proportions with the prolonged stabilization times. },

Thus, workload of clinicians in intensive care unit is too much. In this study, an intelligent mechanical ventilator was designed as a closed loop to reduce workload of clinicians. The device is called intelligent ventilator because of using an intelligent control technique, fuzzy logic. A software-based interface was developed in LabVIEW® to monitor and adjust respiratory variables. In this work, fuzzy controlled the inspiration/expiration valves and pressure regulator in ventilator. Fuzzy has two inputs and two outputs for inspiration/expiration times and it has one input and one output for pressure regulator. The performance of device was tested with eight female Wistar albino rats using pressure-controlled ventilation. Student t test for p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05 was applied to the calculated rats’ lung parameters to determine statistical discrepancy. The results show that there is no statistical discrepancy in rats’ lung parameters for before and after the experiments. It can be said that the designed ventilator supports rats’ artificial respiration, successfully and does not alter the lung parameters of rats. },

Indicators of wetland soil biogeochemical status, such as soil redox potential, pore-water nutrient concentrations, and pore-water total sulfides, were also determined. Total mercury concentrations in plant tissues were within the typical range for vegetation not exposed to mercury contamination. Similarly, total mercury concentrations in soils were typical of uncontaminated wetlands within this geographic region. Soil methyl mercury levels in this study are slightly lower than those reported in other studies of nearby wetlands. This may reflect the less extensive geographic sampling in this study, or the low water levels in the Lake Maurepas system immediately prior to and during this study, which would have altered soil biogeochemical status. This is corroborated by measurements of soil redox potential and soil pore-water nitrogen and sulfur constituents conducted during this study that suggest minimal sulfate reduction was occurring in surficial soils. This study indicates that the wetlands surrounding Lake Maurepas are typical of many uncontaminated oligohaline wetlands in the southeastern U.S. in regard to mercury concentrations. },

  abstract={ Water is the main factor for the healthy life of plant. One of the main negative effects of climate change is the increasing scarcity of water that is lethal for plant. Globally, for water deficit regions (arid and semi-arid), drought is the main factor responsible for low production of agriculture, especially for cotton. Great efforts have been and are being made to find alternatives to water saving practices. This study aimed to examine the effects of partial rhizosphere drying (PRD, half of the root system irrigated at one event, and the other half irrigated in the next event, and so on) with and/or without various mulching treatments on physiological and biochemical traits of cotton. To explore this objective, we laid out experiments in completely randomized design with factorial arrangement in the Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan in 2016. Two factors included were four mulching treatments (M0, no mulching; M1, black plastic mulching; M2, wheat straw mulching; and M3, cotton sticks mulching) and two irrigation levels (I0, control (full irrigation); and I1, PRD). Fisher’s analysis of variance among means of treatments was compared using least significant difference test at 5% probability level. Results revealed that the maximum plant height, leaf area, leaf gas exchange (photosynthetic rate and stomata conductance), chlorophyll, proline and total sugar contents, and enzyme activities were higher under M2 than under other three mulching treatments. As for irrigation levels, higher values of plant height, photosynthesis and water related parameters (leaf water potential, leaf osmotic potential, leaf turgor potential, etc.) were recorded. Contents of total sugar and proline and activities of antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher in PRD-treated plants than in control plants. It was concluded that combined application of PRD and mulching was more effective than the rest of the treatments used in the experiment. Similar study can be conducted in the field by applying irrigation water in alternate rows in semi-arid regions. },

This study implied spearman’s correlation to see the correlation between daily COVID-19 cases and different air pollutants and meteorological variables. Besides, multiple linear regression and the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) were used to investigate the association between COVID-19 cases and other variables used in this study. Due to lockdown measures, significant differences between PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 in 2019 and 2020 were observed in Dhaka city. We used lag-0, lag-7, lag-14, and lag-21 days on daily COVID-19 cases to look at the lag effect of different air pollutants and meteorology. The LRM results showed that the daily COVID-19 cases are significantly correlated with relative humidity (lag-0 days) and pressure (lag-14 days) (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the GAM model results showed a significant nonlinear association among daily COVID-19 cases and meteorology and air quality variables on different lag days. Therefore, our results suggest that an effective public health intervention measures should be implemented to slowdown the spreading of COVID-19. },

The experiments were designed using the Taguchi method to investigate the morphological, physical, and mechanical properties of the nanofibers. The single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) were used in order to improve the mechanical properties of the electrospun nanofibers. The diameter of the PAN nanofibers in the needleless system was less than 300 nm, which was smaller than that in the conventional system. The results showed that the concentration had the greatest impact on the fiber diameter than other parameters in both PAN and PAN/CNT nanofibers. The specific stress of the nanofibers produced by the needleless electrospinning system was lower than that created by the conventional electrospinning system. Addition of The CNT caused to improve the specific stress of the PAN/CNT nanofibers compared with the PAN nanofibers. However, excessive amounts of CNT had a negative effect on the elongation and modulus because of the aggregation of CNT inside the nanofibers. The X-ray diffraction analysis was used to study the crystalline behavior of the PAN nanofibers produced via the needleless electrospinning system. The results showed that the PAN nanofibers had amorphous structure compared with the conventional PAN nanofibers. },

  abstract={ Proteins are regularly described with some general indices (entropy, enthalpy, free energies, hydrophobicity, denaturation temperature etc.), which are inherently statistical in nature. These general indices emerge from innumerable (innately context-dependent and time-dependent) interactions between various atoms of a protein. Many studies have been performed on the nature of these interatomic interactions and the change of profile of atomic fluctuations that they cause. However, we still do not know, under a given context, for a given duration of time, how does a macroscopic property emerge from the cumulative interatomic interactions. An exact answer to that question requires bridging the gap between nano-scale distinguishable atomic description and macroscopic indistinguishable (statistical) measures with mesoscopic description. In this work we propose a mathematical framework that derives expressions to observe emergence of a macroscopic biophysical property from a set of interacting (fluctuating) atoms. Since most of the protein interior interactions are non-linear in nature; observability criteria are derived for both linear and the non-linear descriptions of protein interior. Care has been taken (with extensive literature survey) to ensure that every pertinent bio-physical and bio-chemical facet of protein interior is taken into account, without compromising with the mathematical rigor. Two theorems (concerning mathematical description of protein structure) are proposed here that helps the nascent field of mesoscopic protein studies. Categorical schemes to relate mathematical formulations to studies of pKa shift, residual dipolar coupling, origin of hydrophobicity, drug discovery etc.—are provided to ensure their easy applicability. While the present work helps the theoretical discourse by providing a framework to understand the origin of a macroscopic property; ability of it to predict a priory whether the dynamics in a certain set of atoms or the couplings between them, can at all produce a biological property of interest or not, will account for tremendous saving of resource and effort. },

  abstract={ Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator is a new class of materials that is quickly becoming mainstream in condensed-matter physics. The main obstacle for the development of QSH insulators is that their strong interactions with substrates make them difficult to study experimentally. In this study, using density functional theory, we discovered that MoTe2 is a good match for a GeI monolayer. The thermal stability of a van der Waals GeI/MoTe2 heterosheet was examined via molecular-dynamics simulations. Simulated scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that the GeI monolayer perfectly preserves the bulked honeycomb structure of MoTe2. The GeI on MoTe2 was confirmed to maintain its topological band structure with a sizable indirect bulk bandgap of 0.24 eV by directly calculating the spin Chern number to be −1. As expected, the electron mobility of the GeI is enhanced by MoTe2 substrate restriction. According to deformation-potential theory with the effective-mass approximation, the electron mobility of GeI/MoTe2 was estimated as 372.7 cm2·s−1·V−1 at 300 K, which is 20 times higher than that of freestanding GeI. Our research shows that traditional substrates always destroy the topological states and hinder the electron transport in QSH insulators, and pave way for the further realization and utilization of QSH insulators at room temperature. },

  abstract={ Carbon fibers with diameters ranging from 8.1 and 12.7 µm were produced using a commercially available meta-aramid precursor after oxidation and carbonization steps. The carbonization process was performed using a single-step procedure between 500 and 1100 °C. The effect of temperature on the structure and properties of carbon fibers was investigated in detail. The process of carbonization was examined using several characterization techniques including fiber diameter, mass yield, density, elemental analysis, mechanical property testing and electrical property measurements. Structural transformations were followed and monitored using X-ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The results suggested that the mass yield reached a value of 40.4 % at a heating temperature of 1100 °C. Density, carbon content, mechanical properties and electrical conductivity values increased and hydrogen and nitrogen contents decreased with an increase in temperature. Analysis of the X-ray diffraction traces of carbon fibers suggested broadening of the (002) and (100) diffraction planes which was attributed to the formation of an amorphous carbon structure. The IR spectra showed, at temperatures of 500 °C and above, initial weakening and eventual disappearance of the major amide bands (amide I, II, III and IV) due to the loss of hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains indicating the partial removal of nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen atoms during the carbonization reactions. The analysis of Raman spectra demonstrated that the positions and the peak widths of the G- and D-bands showed great dependence on treatment temperature. The mechanical properties of the carbon fibers showed strong dependence on heat-treatment temperature, porosity and gage length. Temperature and gage length showed a significant effect on the tensile strength values obtained after each treatment temperature. A marked increase was observed in tensile strength values after extrapolation to 1 mm, which increased from 186 to 589 MPa with carbonization up to 1100 °C. Tensile modulus values were affected by both temperature and porosity and reached a value of 81 GPa at 1100 °C. Porosity correction caused an enhancement in tensile modulus values between 21 and 33.5 %. SEM images of carbon fibers demonstrated the presence of structural imperfections confirming the results obtained from the porosity measurements. },

Using this approach, a new objective measure of the impact of permeability and porosity heterogeneity on reservoir performance is obtained. This is used, in conjunction with other dimensionless numbers, to analyse the relative impact of heterogeneity, buoyancy effects, mobility ratio and dispersion on breakthrough time and recovery at 1 pore volume injected during first contact miscible gas injection. This is achieved using results obtained from detailed simulation of miscible displacements through a range of geologically realistic reservoir models. This study goes some way towards developing a unified mathematical framework to determine under which flow conditions reservoir heterogeneity becomes more important than other physical processes. We propose that comparison of these dimensionless numbers can be used to identify the key factors controlling recovery and thus assist the engineer in determining appropriate enhanced oil recovery techniques to improve recovery. },

  abstract={ This research work is based on the isolation of cellulosic fibers from Tunisian olive sawdust (TOS) by alkaline treatment using a solution of NaOH at different concentrations: 5% w/v (TOS5) and 20% w/v (TOS20). The valorization of these cellulosic supports was assessed by the adsorption ability of methylene blue (MB), chosen as a model compound of organic dyes. SEM and FTIR analyses have shown that alkaline treatment produces a delignification of TOS and an elimination of hemicellulose. A transformation of cellulose I to cellulose II was shown by XRD following the decrease of the crystallinity indices passing from TOS5 (∼37%) to TOS20 (∼30%). The spectroscopic study confirmed that the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds have a primordial role in the forms and the structural stability of the cellulosic substrates. Thereby, the deconvolution of OH stretching vibration band confirmed the transition from cellulose I to cellulose II by the occurrence of a new band at 3,080 cm−1 for TOS20. The increase of iodine adsorption values (ISV) from 40 mg·g−1 for TOS5 to 65mg·g−1 for TOS20 is behind the improvement of the accessibility of cellulosic support with alkaline treatment of TOS. The adsorption of MB onto the surface of cellulosic substrates in aqueous mixtures was studied quantitatively. The corresponding isotherms in basic medium have shown the formation of a monolayer following the Langmuir model characterized by 14 mg·g−1, 52 mg·g−1 and 76 mg·g−1 onto the TOS, TOS5 and TOS20, respectively. The desorption efficiency of MB in acid medium increased with 37%, 57% and 71% for TOS, TOS5 and TOS20, respectively. Hence, the extracted cellulosic fibers are likely to be a promising adsorbent for the removal of organic dye from aqueous solutions. },

  abstract={ Initiation is an often-overlooked yet essential stage of the negotiation process. This study examined the effects of two measures of personality—Machiavellianism and risk propensity—and relative bargaining power (as based on multiple situational factors) on three phases of the initiation process—engaging a counterpart, making a request, and optimizing the request. Using a multi-scenario approach, one hundred fifteen participants indicated their initiation preferences for three distinct negotiations. The results of repeated measures ANOVAs indicate that bargaining power influences an individual’s decision to initiate negotiations. In addition, those high in Machiavellianism choose to initiate negotiations even when relative bargaining power is low, whereas those high in risk propensity tend to optimize their requests. The implications of these findings for practitioners and future research are discussed. },

  abstract={ Inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increase in lung injury caused by the loss of integrity of the vascular barrier. The rare ginsenoside Rg4 is a main protopanaxatriol type ginsenoside of black ginseng (BG). The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of Rg4 on PM-induced lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier disruption and pulmonary inflammation. Permeability, leukocyte migration, activation of proinflammatory proteins, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and histology were examined in PM2.5-treated EC and mice. Rg4 significantly scavenged PM2.5-induced ROS, inhibited ROS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), activated Akt in purified pulmonary endothelial cells, which helped maintain endothelial integrity. Further, Rg4 reduced vascular protein leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine release in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in PM-induced mouse lung tissues. Data suggested that Rg4 might exhibit protective effects in PM-induced inflammatory lung injury and vascular hyperpermeability. },

  abstract={ Two different electrospinning processes (traditional single fluid one and a modified coaxial electrospinning with organic solvent as sheath fluid) are investigated in relation to their capability of producing thinner nanofibers. Both the modified coaxial electrospinning and single fluid electrospinning can produce thinner nanofibers with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a polymer model and using a poor volatile solvent N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) in different ways. However the traditional single fluid process was less effective compared to the modified coaxial process, as it suffered more from the limitation of polymer chain entanglement threshold for maintaining structural uniformity of nanofibers. Using DMAc as sheath fluid in the modified process facilitated formation of thinner nanofibers without sacrificing their quality. The mechanism should be that an appropriate DMAc surrounding to the core polymer jet helps to retain it in a fluid state to experience a longer time electrical drawing, with little adverse influence on the polymer chain entanglements. Nanofiber diameters could also be tailored in a linear manner using the modified coaxial process simply through manipulating the sheath solvent flow rates. The modified coaxial process described here extends the capability of electrospinning process and opens a new way to obtain thinner nanofibers with fine structural uniformity. },

Remote sensing and GIS have been widely used to monitor such changes at watershed level. The present study evaluates the LU/LC change during 1989 - 2001 in a semi-arid watershed of central India. Geocoded satellite data of 1989 and 2001 on 1:50,000 scale, were visually interpreted to prepare thematic maps which were later digitized using ArcGIS softwares. The analysis shows that vast tracts of cultivated land have become uncultivated and at some places even converted to wasteland. However, the land under dense forest and open forest has decreased due to expansion of built-up land and other anthropogenic activities. Increase in area of uncultivated land, wasteland and decrease in cultivated land and open scrub is also supported by rainfall analysis, which shows a declining trend and a fall of 186.93 mm in average annual rainfall for 1986-2003 period. The change detection map prepared using land use/land cover of 1989 and 2001 as inputs shows that out of the total geographical area of the watershed, 25.78% of the watershed area has seen a change from one land use category to another, however rest 74.22% has remained unchanged. },

The natural species composition is defined according to species groups obtained using phytocoenological methods. The aim of the study was to establish the relationship between fragmentation indices and the number and proportion of species in each functional species group stated in this paper. This study is based on a dataset of 118 phytocoenological relevés sampled using the standard methodology of the Zürich-Montpellier School, ordered within the suballiance Ulmenion (mixed oak-elm-ash forests along the great rivers). The study area is situated in Central Europe, in the northern part of the Pannonian biogeographic region. The digital map of hardwood floodplain forests was rasterized to 25 m cell size. The FRAGSTATS software was used to obtain fragmentation indices, and generalised linear models tested the influence of forest patch fragmentation indices on species composition. Our analyses confirm that large hardwood floodplain forests are essential for natural species composition conservation, and that large fragment areas are highly susceptible to non-native species penetration. We also determined that small, compact fragments contain very valuable remnants of well-preserved natural hardwood floodplain forests with a high proportion of specialised Ulmenion species. However, disruption to hardwood floodplain forest natural borders engenders a greater threat to its natural species composition than decline in patch area, because disruption results in increased Shape index, increased contact with the surrounding environment, greater edge effect and a higher proportion of alien species in the forest community. },

Powder-type and pellet-type Cu/hexaaluminate catalysts were prepared and their chemico-physical properties were characterized by N2 adsorption, XRD, and XRF. A Cu-hexa-pellet-A catalyst in which copper atoms are positioned inside the hexaaluminate matrix showed the lowest decomposition onset temperature in decomposition of an ADN-based propellant The excellent activity of the Cu-hexa-pellet-A catalyst is ascribed to copper being well incorporated in the hexaaluminate matrix, and the dispersion of the copper is higher than that in two other catalysts. When a thermal shock was applied at a high temperature of 1,200 °C prior to catalyst reuse, physical properties such as surface area, average pore diameter, and the compressive strength of the fresh catalyst did not deteriorate remarkably after five times repetitive reuse and heat treatment. Consequently, the Cu-hexa-pellet-A catalyst was confirmed to be a catalyst that has excellent activity and heat resistance simultaneously in decomposition of an ADN-based propellant. },

For the purpose, cyPPTA is synthesized by phosphorylation-based polycondensation reaction and its pristine fibers with 8-10 μm diameter are fabricated by wet-spinning process. FT-IR and EDS spectra show that the iodination is carried out successfully by forming complexes of polyiodides in the pristine cyPPTA fibers. Accordingly, the residue at 800 °C for the iodinated cyPPTA fiber is found to be higher than that of the pristine fiber. In addition, the thermal stability of iodinated and stabilized cyPPTA fibers is far higher than those of pristine and stabilized fibers. Raman spectra reveal that cyPPTA-based CFs, which are iodinated, stabilized at 400 °C, and carbonized at 700-1000 °C, exhibit the formation of a typical graphitic structure. In addition, high electrical conductivity of ~45.5 S/cm is achieved for the cyPPTA-based CF carbonized at 1000 °C. },

Laboratory parameters and chest CT (computed tomography) imaging were analyzed. The treatment group included six patients who received 150 mg/100 mg of Paxlovid orally once daily for 5 days, whereas the control group included seven patients who received basic treatment. No serious adverse reactions or safety events were recorded. Four control patients progressed to moderate disease, and none in the treatment group showed progression of chest CT findings (P &lt; 0.05). Paxlovid therapy tended toward early viral clearance and low viral load on Day 8. Moreover, 83.3% of the patients in the treatment group and 57.1% of the patients in the control group turned negative within 22 days. In the Paxlovid treatment group, we found significantly increased levels of lymphocytes (P=0.03) and eosinophils (P=0.02) and decreased levels of D-dimer on Day 8 compared with those on Day 1. Paxlovid therapy showed a potential therapeutic effect with good tolerance in hemodialysis patients. The optimal dose and effectiveness evaluation must be further investigated in a largeer cohort. },

  abstract={ Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease that emerged in December of 2019, threatening human health and leading to global public health crises. Airborne transmission via droplets and aerosol has been recently recognized as one of the infection modes for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hospitals have deployed/incorporated indoor air purifiers with the hope to minimize the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the indoor air purifier in reducing the transmission risk remained unknown. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to model the dispersion of the aerosol particles exhaled from the patient under the influence of an air conditioner, exhaust fans and air purifier. The numerical model showed that airflow from the diffusers, exhaust fans and placement of the air purifier significantly influenced the dispersion pattern of the aerosol particles in the common ward. Multiple air purifiers placed at 1 meter above the floor and next to a patient can increase the total efficiency from 37.14 to 59.91% for weak exhalation and from 36.44% to 48.81% for medium exhalation. No aerosol particles flew out from the door for weak and medium exhalation when multiple air purifiers were deployed in the common ward. Location and matching the clean air delivery rate with the size of the room are the important factors that affect the performance of the air purifier. },

  abstract={ The textile industry uses a variety of synthetic dyes for dyeing and discharges a large amount of colored wastewater. It is difficult to achieve good decolorization effect for textile wastewater by conventional biological treatment methods, because it contains various synthetic dyes with complex structures. At present, coagulation is an economical and effective treatment method. However, in dye removal by coagulation research, the adaptability and mechanisms of coagulation removal of many dyes are still unknown due to the wide variety of dyes in use. In this study, ferric chloride (FeCl3), aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) were selected as coagulants, and direct orange 26 (DO), direct yellow 11 (DY) and direct black 19 (DB) were used as the dye samples to conduct a series of coagulation experiments; in order to understand the coagulation adaptability and mechanism for high removal efficiency of direct dyes. In this system without particles, the direct dyes were dissolved directly in pure water and maintained in molecular state. The results showed that 1) AlCl3, FeCl3 and MgCl2 exhibited superior coagulation efficiency on the three dyes. Direct dyes which contain more amino functional groups are more easily removed by coagulation. 2) The influence of hydraulic conditions on the residual turbidity was more significant compared with the color removal. 3) Zeta potential increased with the increase of the coagulant dosage, but the colloidal particles did not re-stabilize. This proved that charge neutralization is not the dominant mechanism of coagulation. The FT-IR and XRD patterns indicated that the direct dyes were removed by the chemical combination of the -SO3H on the dye molecule and the hydrolysate of the coagulant. },

  abstract={ Directed evolution of proteins is a good approach to develop desired phenotypes from existing proteins. Fully experimental protein evolution usually utilizes randomization of a given protein sequence by error-prone PCR or gene shuffling followed by high-throughput selection or timeconsuming screening method. However, these random methods create mutant library full of deleterious mutations. In addition, they need high-throughput screening or selection method to search for positive clones from an enormous size of mutant library. Construction of a mutant library while retaining the original function is important for efficient protein evolution because it greatly reduces time and effort for the identification of positive mutants. Therefore, researchers have tried to reduce the size of mutant library by minimizing the occurrence of deleterious mutants. Such efforts have led to the creation of a concept of ‘small but smart library’. For this goal, neutral drift theory has been applied. Although smart library greatly reduces the library size, it is still the beyond the capacity of low-throughput assay. In parallel, computational analysis of protein structure and efforts to discriminate mutatable residues from all residues of a given protein have been consistently pursued. Accumulated knowledge of protein evolution through random mutation and selection has improved our understanding of functions of amino acids in protein structure. Protein evolution by rational design is being developed based on such understanding. In this review, we describe how the use of semi-rationally designed library rather than completely random one has impacted the overall procedure of directed evolution. We also describe efforts made to evaluate the effect of single mutation. Such efforts will bring lazy boys to the final goal - computational mutation suggestion system. },

Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solution doped with silver nanowires (AgNWs) was wet spun to prepare PVA/AgNWs microfibers, and they were then functioned as the grounded collector during electrospinning process, on which nanofibers were deposited under the effect of electric field force to form a core/sheath structure. The PVA/AgNWs microfibers were part of the electrospinning device, as well as a component of the micro/nano composite fibers at the same time. The addition of a small amount of AgNWs increased the electrical conductivity of the core fibers, and led to the uniformly distributed nanofiber sheaths around the cores. The thickness of the nanofiber sheaths was controlled by the electrical conductivity of the PVA/AgNWs microfibers, and the conductivity was influenced by AgNWs content and fiber draw ratio. When AgNWs content was 0.75 wt%, the electrical conductivity of the PVA/AgNWs microfibers reached maximum, which was most beneficial to attract nanofibers. The carefully designed micro/nano composite fibers may have great potential in a broad range of fields. },

Such a configuration requires a model with very good dispersive properties, because of the high-order harmonics generated by topography-induced nonlinear interactions. We thus depart from the aforementioned work and choose to use a new Green–Naghdi system with improved frequency dispersion characteristics. The absence of dry areas also allows us to improve the treatment of the hyperbolic part of the equations. This leads to very satisfying results for the demanding benchmarks under consideration. },

  abstract={ Aimed to control debris flows more effectively, we attempt to develop a new structure called a “sloping roof grill dam”, which consists of guidance walls, separation grills and lateral deposit areas. A series of flume tests were performed to verify the function of this new structure, focusing on the trapping efficiency (β), deceleration efficiency (μ) and coarse-fine sediment separation extents (η) under different conditions of structure and debris flows. Experimental results show that both the trapping and deceleration efficiency increase with a decrease in permeability, whereas the separation extent shown the opposite effect. Multiple regression analysis indicates that β and η are linearly dependent on the permeability, deceleration efficiency and magnitudes of debris flow. In addition, an increase in beam gap can lead to an increase in the impact area downstream for the debris flow after the control of the structure. Finally, a two-level installation of the structure is tested to determine whether there is an enhancement of the debris control, which indicated that although the trapping effect of the two-level structure is considerably greater than that of a single-level structure (2.11 times at maximum), the separation extent of the two-level structure is not distinct and may be even lower. },

It was observed that nanofibers produced from DMSO and NMP solvents had larger fiber diameters than nanofibers produced from DMF. When the crystallinity of the 100 % PAN nanofibers were compared, the nanofibers electrospun from DMSO had the lowest crystallinity values. The tensile breaking stress values of the nanowebs produced from DMSO and NMP were higher than nanowebs produced from DMF while the breaking elongation values of the nanowebs produced from DMF was higher. Mechanical dispersion technique resulted in higher tensile breaking stress values than corresponding magnetic stirring. The redoping process also affected the tensile properties of the nanowebs by increasing the breaking stress values and decreasing the breaking elongation values. When DMSO was used as a solvent for the production of composite nanofibers, the electrical conductivity values at around 10−6 S/cm were obtained corresponding to the semiconductive material range. The use of solvent mixtures resulted in better conductivity values than their counterparts. When CSA-NMP and CSA-NMP/DMF were compared, the nanofibers produced from the solvent mixture had higher conductivity values. On redoping, the conductivity increased 10 times and reached 1.2×10−5 S/cm. The reference samples with DMSO had the lowest cyclization temperature and enthalpy. Addition of PANI increased the thermal stability of the composite nanofibers in comparison with pure PAN. },

  abstract={ To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine (CM) in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. A multi-center retrospective cohort study was carried out, with cumulative CM treatment period of ⩾3 days during hospitalization as exposure. Data came from consecutive inpatients from December 19, 2019 to May 16, 2020 in 4 medical centers in Wuhan, China. After data extraction, verification and cleaning, confounding factors were adjusted by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for statistical analysis. A total of 2,272 COVID-19 patients were included. There were 1,684 patients in the CM group and 588 patients in the control group. Compared with the control group, the hazard ratio (HR) for the deterioration rate in the CM group was 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41 to 0.64, P&lt;0.001]. The results were consistent across patients of varying severity at admission, and the robustness of the results were confirmed by 3 sensitivity analyses. In addition, the HR for all-cause mortality in the CM group was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.44, P&lt;0.001). Regarding of safety, the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function or renal function in the CM group was smaller. This real-world study indicates that the combination of a full-course CM therapy on the basic conventional treatment, may safely reduce the deterioration rate and all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients. This result can provide the new evidence to support the current treatment of COVID-19. Additional prospective clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of specific CM interventions. (Registration No. ChiCTR2200062917) },

The catalytic performance toward CO2 reforming of methane and the physicochemical properties were investigated by means of GC, BET, XRD, FESEM, TEM, EDX, TG-DTG, XPS and FTIR techniques. The plasma-treated nanocatalyst contains smaller crystal size and high dispersion of NiO. Plasma treatment decreased particle size and plasma high energy species flattened particles on support, increasing the interaction between support and active metals which leads to high catalytic activity. Low temperature activity and H2/CO ratio closer to 1 was observed for plasma-treated nanocatalyst compared to non-treated sample. Moreover, higher product yield and H2/CO ratio was found in CH4/CO2=1 rather than CH4/CO2=1.5. Time on stream test during 1,440 min at 850 °C showed plasma-treated Ni-Cu/Al2O3-ZrO2 nanocatalyst did not experience any deactivation in terms of CH4 and CO2 conversion and H2/CO ratio. },

A Student-Centered Adaptable Learning Environment (SCALE) was created to improve engagement from affective and cognitive perspectives using choice, creativity and technological allowances. Results demonstrated that fast and slow learners are generally separated by about 30&nbsp;min in terms of inputting speeds, but can be as much as 65&nbsp;min apart from one another. Given that traditional classrooms afford students only 45&nbsp;min in which to learn, static time could have become a source of inequity in public schools. SCALE optimally allowed for the dynamic use of time in constrained periods, therefore reducing and even eliminating any negative relationships between speed of learning and resultant achievement gains in the block setting. Especially benefitting from their ability to maneuver were the slowest learners, who showed the largest achievement improvements in either time interval amongst ability groupings. As learning speed can be the most critical contributing component of resultant educational outcomes, providing students the ability to use time dynamically should be considered as a feasible solution to helping teachers reestablish equity in mixed-ability classrooms in public schools. },

  abstract={ The field of colloidal nanocrystals has witnessed enormous progress in the last three decades. For many families of nanocrystals, wet-chemical syntheses have been developed that allow control over the crystal shape and dimensions, from the three-dimensional down to the zero-dimensional case. Additionally, careful control of surface chemistry has enabled the prevention of non-radiative recombination, thus allowing the detailed study of confined charge carriers and excitons. This has led to a vast amount of applications of nanocrystals in displays, labels, and lighting. Here, we discuss how this expertise could benefit the rapidly advancing field of quantum materials, where the coherence of electronic wave functions is key. We demonstrate that colloidal two-dimensional nanocrystals can serve as excellent model systems for studying topological phase transitions, particularly in the case of quantum spin Hall and topological crystalline insulators. We aim to inspire researchers with strong chemical expertise to explore the exciting field of quantum materials. },

In the past few years, new, larger scale experiments have made it possible to construct statistical mechanics models of biological systems directly from real data. We review the surprising successes of this “inverse” approach, using examples from families of proteins, networks of neurons, and flocks of birds. Remarkably, in all these cases the models that emerge from the data are poised near a very special point in their parameter space—a critical point. This suggests there may be some deeper theoretical principle behind the behavior of these diverse systems. },

  abstract={ Magnesium is one of the most essential mineral in the human body, connected with brain biochemistry and the fluidity of neuronal membrane. Avariety of neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms, including different types of depression, was observed in magnesium deficiency. Plasma/serum magnesium levels do not seem to be the appropriate indicators of depressive disorders, since ambiguous outcomes, depending on the study, were obtained. The emergence of a new approach to magnesium compounds in medical practice has been seen. Apart from being administered as components of dietary supplements, they are also perceived as the effective agents in treatment of migraine, alcoholism, asthma, heart diseases, arrhythmias, renal calcium stones, premenstrual tension syndrome etc. Magnesium preparations have an essential place in homeopathy as a remedy for a range of mental health problems. Mechanisms of antidepressant action of magnesium are not fully understood yet. Most probably, magnesium influences several systems associated with development of depression. The first information on the beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate given hypoder-mically to patients with agitated depression was published almost 100 years ago. Numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies confirmed the initial observations as well as demonstrated the beneficial safety profile of magnesium supplementation. Thus, magnesium preparations seem to be a valuable addition to the pharmacological armamentarium for management of depression. },

  abstract={ Bismuth telluride is known to wield unique properties for a wide range of device applications. However, as devices migrate to the nanometer scale, significant amount of studies are being conducted to keep up with the rapidly growing nanotechnological field. Bi2Te3 possesses distinctive properties at the nanometer level from its bulk material. Therefore, varying synthesis and characterization techniques are being employed for the realization of various Bi2Te3 nanostructures in the past years. A considerable number of these works have aimed at improving the thermoelectric (TE) figure-of-merit (ZT) of the Bi2Te3 nanostructures and drawing from their topological insulating properties. This paper reviews the various Bi2Te3 and Bi2Te3-based nanostructures realized via theoretical and experimental procedures. The study probes the preparation techniques, TE properties and the topological insulating effects of 0D, 1D, 2D and Bi2Te3 nanocomposites. With several applications as a topological insulator (TI), the topological insulating effect of the Bi2Te3 is reviewed in detail with the time reversal symmetry (TRS) and surface state spins which characterize TIs. Schematics and preparation methods for the various nanostructural dimensions are accordingly categorized. },

  abstract={ In healthcare facilities, including hospitals, pathogen transmission can lead to infectious disease outbreaks, highlighting the need for effective disinfection protocols. Although disinfection robots offer a promising solution, their deployment is often hindered by their inability to accurately recognize human activities within these environments. Although numerous studies have addressed Human Activity Recognition (HAR), few have utilized scene graph features that capture the relationships between objects in a scene. To address this gap, our study proposes a novel hybrid multi-classifier information fusion method that combines scene graph analysis with visual feature extraction for enhanced HAR in healthcare settings. We first extract scene graphs, complete with node and edge attributes, from images and use a graph classification network with a graph attention mechanism for activity recognition. Concurrently, we employ Swin Transformer and convolutional neural network models to extract visual features from the same images. The outputs from these three models are then integrated using a hybrid information fusion approach based on Dempster-Shafer theory and a weighted majority vote. Our method is evaluated on a newly compiled hospital activity data set, consisting of 5,770 images across 25 activity categories. The results demonstrate an accuracy of 90.59%, a recall of 90.16%, and a precision of 90.31%, outperforming existing HAR methods and showing its potential for practical applications in healthcare environments. },

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest developments in self-healing concrete. It begins by summarizing the methods used to evaluate the self-healing efficiency of concrete. Next, it compares strategies for achieving healing concrete. It then discusses the typical approaches for developing self-healing concrete. Finally, critical insights are proposed to guide future studies on the development of novel self-healing concrete.

It is known that some periods in early pre- and postnatal ontogenesis are very sensitive to some environmental and endogenous influences. These periods are characterized as highly vulnerable to the formation of a complex of epigenetic changes that may determine the trajectory of the further formation of physiological systems involved in the blood-pressure regulation. Early life influences on these systems may predispose an individual to the development of hypertensive disease in further life. In some cases, the transmission of epigenetic changes to the next generations may resolve the contradiction between the high heritability of arterial hypertensive disease and the low total contribution of polymorphic DNA variants in the population variability of blood pressure values. },

The bands consist of nanoparticles 25 nm in thickness and 400–500 nm in length. The chitin nanofibrils are composed of two crystallites with cross-sectional sizes of 11–12 nm and b axes perpendicular to the nanofibril axis. The chitin nanofibrils tend to form planar elements with a layered structure on both the microlevel and the nanolevel. The addition of chitin nanofibrils to a chitosan solution leads to a rise in its viscosity. However, the action of shear stresses leads to a substantial decrease in the chitosan-chitin solution viscosity, a phenomenon that is due to the presence of planar anisodiametric nanoparticles of chitin. },

In the current teaching assessment model that solely relies on Grade Point Average (GPA), learners with different learning abilities may be classified as the same type of student. It is challenging to uncover the underlying logic behind different learning patterns when GPA scores are the same. To address the limitations of pure GPA evaluation, we propose a data-driven assessment strategy as a supplement to the current methodology. Firstly, we integrate self-paced learning and graph memory neural networks to develop a learning performance prediction model called the self-paced graph memory network. Secondly, inspired by outliers in linear regression, we use a t-test approach to identify those student samples whose loss values significantly differ from normal samples, indicating that these students have different inherent learning patterns/logic compared to the majority. We find that these learners’ GPA levels are distributed across different levels. Through analyzing the learning process data of learners with the same GPA level, we find that our data-driven strategy effectively addresses the shortcomings of the GPA evaluation model. Furthermore, we validate the rationality of our method for student data modeling through protein classification experiments and student performance prediction experiments, it ensuring the rationality and effectiveness of our method. },

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of visible (Vis) and near-infrared (NIR) refl ectance spectroscopy to predict paddy soil properties in a typical Malaysian paddy fi eld. To assess the utility of spectroscopy for soil physical characteristics (bulk density, moisture content, clay, silt and sand) prediction, 118 soil samples were used for laboratory analysis and optical measurement in the Vis-NIR region using an analytical spectral device (ASD) FieldSpec spectroradiometer (350–2500 nm). The Savitzky–Golay algorithm and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were then applied to preprocess, model, and predict the properties on the basis of their spectral refl ectance within the Vis-NIR range. One-third of the samples (40 samples) were withheld for validation purposes. The study revealed that Vis and NIR spectroscopy calibration models for all the measured soil physical characteristics provided a good fi t (R2 &gt; 0.78); hence Vis and NIR (specifi cally NIR refl ectance) can be considered to be a reliable tool to assess soil physical properties of Malaysian paddy fi elds. The results of this study could contribute signifi cantly to developing site-specifi c management. },

  abstract={ The growing number of older people worldwide poses challenges for health policy, particularly in the Global North, where policymakers increasingly expect seniors to live and receive care at home. However, healthcare professionals, particularly in home-based care, face dilemmas between adhering to care ideals and meeting external demands. Although they strive to uphold ethical care standards, they must deal with patients’ needs, cooperation with colleagues and management guidelines. Home-based care is an essential part of healthcare services in Norway, but staff struggle with high patient numbers and time management. This article focuses on how staff deal with ethical challenges related to contextual and organisational constraints. An ethnographic fieldwork in three municipalities in South-East Norway. The first author conducted three to four months of participant observation in each municipality. In addition, she conducted in-depth interviews with key informants in two municipalities and a focus group interview with seven home-based care workers in one municipality. The data was analysed by using a reflexive thematic analysis. Staff in home-based care are frequently more loyal to the patient than to the system and to their own needs. To provide good care, all informants disregarded the patient’s formal decision, i.e. they provided more care than the formalised decision stipulated. To prioritise beneficence to patients, informants also disregarded some of the rules applicable in home-based care. In addition, staff accepted risks to their own safety and health to provide care in the patient’s home. The loyalty of home-based care staff to their patients can go beyond their loyalty to the rules of the system and even their own safety. This commitment might be attributed to a sense of doing meaningful work, to providing relationship-based and individualised care, and to strong moral courage. However, the staff’s emphasis on flexibility and individualised care also brings challenges related to unclear boundaries related to patient care. },

  abstract={ This paper articulates John Dewey’s socio-political and historical influence upon the foundation and evolution of the world-renowned Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. It proposes that the pedagogical depth, influence and endurance of the Italian project are grounded in Dewey’s philosophies of education, aesthetics and democracy. An analysis of scholarly and original sources outlines the socio-political climate in post World War II Italy, the work undertaken by several progressive Italian educators and the Italian translations of Dewey’s work during this period to reveal new insights about Dewey’s enduring influence on the pedagogical values which underpin the Reggio Emilia educational approach. In so doing, it acknowledges the direct Deweyan influence on the work of Italian reformers Borghi, Codignola, Malaguzzi and Ciari and on the developing Reggio Emilia project. This revelation of Dewey’s progressive values as interpreted by educators in Reggio Emilia offers inspiration to educators in contemporary early childhood contexts, to researchers and to students of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. },

  abstract={ Experiences in early childhood form the bedrock of future human potential. In impoverished settings, structured early childhood education (ECE) in preschool years can augment overall childhood and later human abilities. The current study evaluates preschool learning exposure and childhood cognition, using longitudinal follow-up of a community-based birth cohort in Vellore, south India. The birth cohort study site in Vellore recruited 251 newborns between 2010 and 2012 from dense urban settlements and further followed up into childhood. Preschool enrolment details were obtained from parents. Childhood cognition was assessed by Weschler’s preschool primary scale of intelligence (WPPSI) and Malin’s intelligence scale for Indian Children (MISIC) at 5 and 9&nbsp;years of age respectively. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed with adjustments for socio-economic status (SES), maternal education, stunting status and home environment. Out of 251 new-borns recruited into the MAL-ED birth cohort, 212 (84.46%) and 205 (81.7%) children were available for the 5&nbsp;year and 9&nbsp;year follow-up respectively. At 5&nbsp;years, structured ECE of 18 to 24&nbsp;months duration was significantly associated with higher cognition scores, with the highest increase in processing speed [β: 19.55 (11.26–27.77)], followed by full-scale intelligence [β: 6.75 (2.96–10.550)], even after adjustments for SES, maternal cognition, home factors and early childhood stunting status. Similarly adjusted analysis at 9&nbsp;years showed that children who attended 1.5–2&nbsp;years of structured ECE persisted to have higher cognition, especially in the performance domain [β: 8.82 (2.60–15.03)], followed by the full-scale intelligence [β: 7.24 (2.52–11.90)]. Follow-up of an Indian birth cohort showed that structured ECE exposure was associated with better school entry cognition as well as mid-childhood cognition. Strengthening ECE through a multi-pronged approach could facilitate to maximize cognitive potential of human capital. },

  abstract={ Recent social policy reforms have sought to overcome the limitations of “First Way” strategies emphasizing the welfare state and “Second Way” approaches advocating markets. Scholars and policymakers instead have begun to explore optimal synthesis of the public and private sector in a new “Third Way” of leadership and change. According to one line of interpretation advanced by Andy Hargreaves and Dennis Shirley, however, the Third Way as developed in education has ushered in a new orthodoxy of testing, accountability, and data-driven decision making. This new orthodoxy is said to distract educators from their true moral purposes. Hence, Hargreaves and Shirley have called for a new “Fourth Way” of change that draws upon international best practices in education. In this interpretive essay for a Festschrift issue of the Journal of Educational Change celebrating Andy Hargreaves’ 60th birthday, Dennis Shirley revisits Fourth Way change architecture to inquire after the appropriate role of new technologies in classrooms and schools. He retrieves the concept of mindful teaching and learning from the Fourth Way change model and illustrates how it can be used as a lens to adjudicate various interpretations of the appropriate role of new technologies in schools. },

The article shows that what characterizes capitalism today is the extreme variety of the life forms, and therefore the fragmentation of the forms of personality, which can favor capitalism or be absorbed in it. This observation provides the means to evaluate, with a fresh look, the conclusions of one of the most famous and constitutive discussions in the history of modern European sociology. },

  abstract={ Research that is collaborative, interdisciplinary, and engaged with non-university partners has emerged as desirable for training graduate students to address complex issues in natural resource management. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding why researchers may participate in various forms of collaborative research, especially among graduate students in environmental conservation. We explored graduate students’ research experiences and the characteristics and attitudes associated with collaborative research and two specific types of collaboration: interdisciplinary collaboration and engaged research. We surveyed 56 graduate students who were affiliated with University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program on biodiversity conservation under novel ecosystems. We investigated differences between the different categories of collaborative research with logistic regression and decision tree analysis using the classification and regression tree (CRT) algorithm. Students with more collaborators were more likely to feel supported by an intellectual community and view interdisciplinary research as vital for conservation practice. Students with an interdisciplinary collaboration were more likely to be comfortable collaborating with peers but less likely to view collaboration as contributing to their research. Students engaged with non-academics were less comfortable collaborating with faculty and more concerned that becoming engaged with conservation policy or practice may negatively impact them. Of the ten instances in which variables were significant across the three logistic regressions, eight were also identified in the CRT model. This suggests relatively high agreement between the two statistical approaches. The different forms of collaborative research had different predictors and should not be viewed as interchangeable. Further attention is needed on approaches for enhancing graduate students’ training and experience with collaborative environmental research. },

  abstract={ Generativity researchers most often portray generativity as the long period of adulthood when individuals move into various roles of societal responsibility. Measures are designed to capture the unlimited ways individuals demonstrate care and concern for society’s continued well-being in the domains of family, work, and community, consequently sustaining the general society and the next generation. However, an alternative form of generativity is also prevalent in the generativity literature. This form portrays generativity as the continued investment of one’s most productive time and one’s most creative, intellectual, and material resources toward a single project over many years—one’s life’s work, which is to positively impact society in some idiosyncratic way. Erikson, McAdams, generativity psycho-biographers, and lifespan psychologists demonstrate clear recognition of personalized generativity; however, empirical studies featuring this form have not followed. Of the 26 generativity studies examined, none contain clear personalized generativity indicators. Research in other areas of adult psychological development strongly suggests that it is the identity-related (personalized) aspects of generativity that are more closely associated with psychological well-being in mid- to late life. Distinguishing these two forms of generative expression may help us to (1) better understand the relationship between aspects of generativity and well-being; (2) clarify some of the current discriminant validity measurement concerns in generativity research; and (3) invite important intervention strategies that could lead to creative, highly specified, and effective solutions to contemporary social problems and to later life revitalization for older adults. },

  abstract={ For most Americans, access to a quality education has always been perceived as the fundamental link to upward mobility and increased life chances within our society (Ballantine and Hammack in The sociology of education: a systematic analysis. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2011; Brown et al. 2010; Holyfield 2002). This perception of the role of education has been particularly salient for African American people. From the beginning of their experiences in America, the African American community creatively established schools for their children (Anderson in The education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1988). Even during the enslavement of the majority of African people in this country, they would often risk their lives in the effort to learn to read and write (Douglass and Stepto in Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2009). Subsequently this rich history, along with the continued presence of inequities and underachievement in the public schools became the undergirding impetus for the development of independent Black schools within the African American communities around the nation beginning in the early 1960’s. Through the years, many of these schools have waged a fervent battle to remain operating. In spite of difficulties with various factors such as, finances, facilities location and maintenance, as well as an unstable teaching force, the leaders who founded these institutions remain committed to the education of African American children. Currently, there is a paucity of research on the founders of these independent Black schools. The purpose of this study was to investigate the educational philosophy and strategies which guided the decision-making process of the founder of an independent Black school. },

  abstract={ The paper attempts to place the emergence of cognitive science (CS) as an interdisciplinary research program in historical context. A broad overview of the institutional and intellectual situations during the early postwar period is presented, focusing primarily on psychology and artificial intelligence (AI). From an institutional perspective, the paper shows that although computers and computer science were closely linked with weapons research during World War II, the postwar creation of cognitive science had no military connection, but was largely enabled by small grants from private foundations, though the RAND Corporation was involved to a limited extent. From an epistemic perspective, the paper shows: (1) that neobehaviourist learning theory was not replaced by, but flourished parallel to cognition-oriented psychology in the 1950s, because they were located in different sub-disciplines; (2) that the key theoretical inputs into CS were developed separately at first, and each group remained affiliated with the discipline or complex of disciplines from which it came. A certain tension remained at the core of the project between the machine dreams of the emerging AI community and the idea of autonomous mental processes central to cognitive psychology. },

Within institutional, ethics, and change leadership theory, quantitative, mixture solutions such as distributive solutions have been frequently considered. The ethics, institutional, and change leadership theory literatures have recognized that there are qualitative transformational solutions that are different than quantitative mixture solutions. However and for the most part, with the notable exception of the Thornton et al. (Am J Sociol, 105(3):801–843, 2012) typology of solutions, the institutional, change leadership, and ethics literatures have not considered typologies of transformational solutions. And more specifically with respect to this article, the institutional, change leadership, and ethics literatures have not considered different types of transformational solutions to institutional logic conflicts with ethical dimensions. This article: (1) develops a typology of transformational solutions; (2) applies the typology with historical examples of conflicting institutional ethics logics within factory, cultural, and institutional social change leadership cases; and, (3) considers practical and theoretical implications for institutional ethics change leadership for achieving and/or resisting different types of transformational solutions. },

The Museum of Natural History of the University of Florence houses today collections that belonged to Nicolas Steno, when fossils were for the first time used as documents to reconstruct Earth history. Natural philosophers and geologists, both Italian and foreigners, continued to study fossils collected in Tertiary strata of Tuscany until the nineteenth century, when the first speculations on the origin of species were proposed. Charles Darwin himself mentions fossil vertebrates that are today on show in our museum. In the last years, this part of the history of science has been proposed to the public. The aim was to foster an understanding of the centrality of fossils in two cultural revolutions, the discovery of deep time and the birth of evolutionary theory–connected among themselves and with the emergence of geology. Dedicated volumes, public conferences, guided visits to the collections, and field trips to paleontological sites have attracted an attentive and responsive public, showing that the history of science can help deliver modern evolutionary thinking. Other activities aimed at students of all ages have also shown that the interaction between schools, university teachers, and museum personnel is vital to form the mind of future generations on the reality of the evolution of natural systems. },

Advocates point to the growing body of research linking art education to academic achievement as justification for arts’ continued inclusion in the curriculum. In its 2005 report, the National Association of State Boards of Education highlighted this research trend and called for stronger emphasis on arts in educational curricula (Meyer in Arts Educ Policy Rev 106(3):35–40, 2005). Yet despite the evidence, school districts across the nation have been slow to include more arts programming within the classroom. This study, however, examines one school district that did. In a collaborative project between a large urban school district and a local arts and science council, an arts integration program called Wolf Trap was implemented in economically disadvantaged pre-Kindergarten and first-grade classrooms at selected schools across the district. Objectives of the program were to: (a) improve school readiness skills among participants; (b) increase capacity of classroom teachers to learn and implement effective arts-based teaching strategies; and (c) increase the capacity of teaching artists to acquire and model effective arts-based teaching strategies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the program using data from the teaching artists, classroom teachers, and the external evaluators. We discuss the program in detail and explain the methodology used in our evaluation. Finally, we present evidence that indicates the program’s success and we offer recommendations for program stakeholders. },

Conversely, the&nbsp; critics of post-modern political correctness uphold Enlightenment liberal principles of scientific reasoning, rational truth-seeking and open discourse against claims of relativism and oppression. Yet, both the post-modern proponents and their Enlightenment liberal critics make up two sides of the same phenomenon of political correctness. Both sides intend to protect a liberal value system from illiberal truth-claims, which is the function of politically correct regulation. While post-modern advocates attempt to promote liberating tolerance, Enlightenment liberals place liberal values above the open-ended search for truth. Despite appearances to the contrary, this socio-academic debate is not about two sides favouring and opposing political correctness.

I argue that the current social dilemmas and struggles in the U.S. represent a crisis of care. In particular, I note that several social-political and economic factors heighten existential vulnerability and anxiety, which in turn give rise to rampant social, class, and ecclesial divisions, hostile conflicts, and interhuman alienation, all of which signify and contribute to a diminished obligation to care for Others. This diagnosis of the social situation sets the stage for a prescription—depicting the kind of leadership needed in society and communities of faith. Beginning with a brief eisegetical account of a passage from the Gospel of Thomas, I contend that care-full pastoral leadership in a polarized society requires radical courage, humility, compassion, and hope. I conclude with a brief discussion on ways to form pastoral leaders who can attend to the ambiguities, uncertainties, vulnerabilities, and division within their churches, as well as invite their communities of faith to be compassionate and reconciling presences in a culture of conflict and alienation. },

It takes a historical perspective, using this context to explore contemporary enabling and constraining factors for curriculum integration in Australian schools. It argues that while curriculum integration might provide a possible pathway to realising contemporary goals for Australian education, to a large extent this will rely on opportunities for the teaching profession to develop a robust sense of identity around ‘curriculum work’, reclaiming this space over that of ‘curriculum deliverer’. It argues that this in itself will require a resistance to some of the dominant ideas about curriculum, pedagogy and teachers’ work embedded in contemporary education policy and suggests some of the forms that this resistance might take. },

To demonstrate the differences between the correctness of task performance and the age and gender of the children, a Pearson’s Chi squared test was performed. To analyse the time that children from the study group needed to perform specific tasks, Student’s t test was employed. In all analysed cases, the significance level p = .05 was assumed. The results of the research involving the studied group of children (N = 176) demonstrated differences in the level of geometric skills. Regarding biological variables, such as gender and age, statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the age of the studied group. Distinguishing between plane shapes did not cause any problems in comparison with the tasks which required analytical thinking. The most evident distinctions were observed between children aged 5 and older children (6 and 7&nbsp;years old). The level of difficulty of the tasks was a factor that affected the time needed&nbsp;to provide answers irrespective of gender. The level of geometric performance of the majority of the studied children was normal. Nonetheless, individual targeted interventions should be considered with respect to certain children with mathematical problems in order to improve their geometric skills before they start school education. The development of pedagogical interventions should be preceded by a targeted diagnosis of unsatisfactory performance and progress with respect to elementary mathematical skill acquisition. Teachers should be inspired to use innovative methods and techniques in their didactic practise in order to motivate children to study geometry. },

Using home–school literacy bags, children and parents learned how to combine expressive arts and emergent literacy strategies including alphabet recognition, phonemic and phonological awareness, and oral language fluency. State-of-the-art activities designed for each of the multiple intelligences met the needs of diverse students with many different learning styles and interests. As families participated in fall and spring school-based Festivals in which they shared the literacy bags in small group family literature circles, they demonstrated children’s emerging literacy skills in a relaxed, yet highly engaging atmosphere. },

  abstract={ In light of increasing levels of polarization between liberals and conservatives both in the classroom and in the wider culture, this article uses an introductory seminary course as a springboard for reflection upon pedagogical practices and assumptions to help address this divide. Special attention is given to the work of moral psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, as presented in his book, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012). Haidt’s work seeks to enhance mutual understanding between persons on both sides of political and religious debates by showing that there are multiple legitimate foundations for making moral judgments. Although he does not frame his argument explicitly in terms of the mind-body problem, he consistently challenges the way western philosophy and psychology have privileged individual reason over the passions, social intuition, and other automatic processes associated with the body. He further challenges this age-old dualism by drawing upon body-related metaphors to make his case against moral monism and a narrow understanding of cognition restricted to conscious reasoning, exclusive of intuition and emotion as additional forms of information processing. Thus, the research of Haidt and other psychologists can contribute some “new directions” to the way we conceive of and teach in relationship to the “old connections” of body/mind and self/other (the theme of the 2012 Conference of the Group for New Directions in Pastoral Theology). },

  abstract={ The learner and the learning content are the key factors that contribute to the success of any learning system. In this regard, scientific research is focused on these two factors to improve learner engagement with the learning environment. Each learner seeks an environment appropriate to their needs, which provides personalized and adaptive content to ensure a more successful and useful learning experience for them. To deliver this content, we identify the learner’s intentions, needs and preferences. Existing research is emerging towards the adaptation of learning systems and shows that modeling the learner profile is an important process for achieving this adaptation. We have found that it is necessary to focus on the learner and focus on their dynamic profile to improve their engagement with the learning environment. In this work, we integrate the concept of adaptation into the learning systems, but also to integrate the concept of gamification, based on the dynamic learner profile, to offer an environment not only adequate for academic needs but also a fun and entertaining environment. It is therefore this context that we propose an adaptive gamification approach called “AG-Learn” (Adaptive Gamification in Learning) by focusing on several learner characteristics, using machine learning techniques and recommender systems. We have combined the two concepts “adaptive learning” and “gamification” to provide gamified learning adapted to the learner profile with the objective of motivating and engaging them more and improving the quality of education and learning outcomes. We tested the effectiveness of our contributions in a gamified learning environment called “Class Quiz”. },

  abstract={ In accordance with the outcomes from a number of reports, there are cognitive and academic improvements derived from chess learning and chess playing. This evidence, however, endures three key limitations: (a) ignoring theoretical premises about the concept of transfer, (b) several shortcomings regarding ideal experiment guidelines, and (c) an uncritical faith in null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) statistical analyses. The present review scrutinized the NHST outcomes from 45 studies describing chess instruction interventions (n = 12,705) in nineteen countries that targeted cognitive ability (100 tests) and academic performance (108 tests), with a mean Hedge’s effect size g = 572 (95% CI = [0.127, 1.062]). There was a lower average statistical power, a higher proportion of false positive outcomes, larger publication biases, and lower replication rates for the studies in the academic performance domain than in the cognitive ability domain. These findings raised reasonable concerns over the evidence about the benefits of chess instruction, which was particularly problematic regarding academic achievement outcomes. Chess should perhaps be regularly taught, however, regardless of whether it has a direct impact or not in cognitive abilities and academic performance, because these are far transfer targets. The more likely impact of chess on near transfer outcomes from higher quality studies remains at present unexplored. },

Among them, there are nonlocal transport in magnetized plasma, absorption and penetration of laser radiation in dense plasma, nonlocal effects related to inverse-bremsstrahlung heating and ponderomotive interaction, plasma fluctuations caused by a speckled laser beam, propagation of laser radiation and parametric instabilities in low-density plasma, and ion-acoustic instability of the return current. Many results are applicable for arbitrary relations between the characteristic spatial and time scales of the plasma parameters, which substantially advances the concept of laser-plasma interaction in hot plasma as compared to the conventional theories of collisionless and strongly collisional plasmas. },

  abstract={ More than a half-century ago, the ‘cognitive revolution’, with the influential tenet ‘cognition is computation’, launched the investigation of the mind through a multidisciplinary endeavour called cognitive science. Despite significant diversity of views regarding its definition and intended scope, this new science, explicitly named in the singular, was meant to have a cohesive subject matter, complementary methods and integrated theories. Multiple signs, however, suggest that over time the prospect of an integrated cohesive science has not materialized. Here we investigate the status of the field in a data-informed manner, focusing on four indicators, two bibliometric and two socio-institutional. These indicators consistently show that the devised multi-disciplinary program failed to transition to a mature inter-disciplinary coherent field. Bibliometrically, the field has been largely subsumed by (cognitive) psychology, and educationally, it exhibits a striking lack of curricular consensus, raising questions about the future of the cognitive science enterprise. Núñez et al. use bibliometric and socio-institutional indicators to show that over the years, cognitive science has failed to transition to a mature, coherent, interdisciplinary field. },

Because he saw Christianity as lying ‘against the grain’ of social necessity, he regarded the inevitable accommodations of the faith to each particular social and political structure in which it became embedded as successive forms of secularisation. He saw this as the price Christianity paid in order to infiltrate its alternative message of transcendent hope into the culture, symbols and institutional life of any society. The essay discusses David’s conception of sociology as one of the humanities because of the importance of meaning in its analyses. It summarises his accounts of music and architecture as aspects of the dialectic between the social, or Durkheimian, ‘sacred’ and the Christian ‘sacred’ in the history of the Christian and post-Christian West and ends with an outline of his book on narratives of secularisation through the lens of English poetry published in January&nbsp;2020. },

  abstract={ Interest into the effects of carnosine on cellular metabolism is rapidly expanding. The first study to demonstrate in humans that chronic β-alanine (BA) supplementation (~3–6&nbsp;g&nbsp;BA/day for ~4 weeks) can result in significantly augmented muscle carnosine concentrations (&gt;50%) was only recently published. BA supplementation is potentially poised for application beyond the niche exercise and performance-enhancement field and into other more clinical populations. When examining all BA supplementation studies that directly measure muscle carnosine (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;8), there is a significant linear correlation between total grams of BA consumed (of daily intake ranges of 1.6–6.4&nbsp;g&nbsp;BA/day) versus both the relative and absolute increases in muscle carnosine. Supporting this, a recent dose–response study demonstrated a large linear dependency (R 2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.921) based on the total grams of BA consumed over 8&nbsp;weeks. The pre-supplementation baseline carnosine or individual subjects’ body weight (from 65 to 90&nbsp;kg) does not appear to impact on subsequent carnosine synthesis from BA consumption. Once muscle carnosine is augmented, the washout is very slow (~2%/week). Recently, a slow-release BA tablet supplement has been developed showing a smaller peak plasma BA concentration and delayed time to peak, with no difference in the area under the curve compared to pure BA in solution. Further, this slow-release profile resulted in a reduced urinary BA loss and improved retention, while at the same time, eliciting minimal paraesthesia symptoms. However, our complete understanding of optimizing in vivo delivery and dosing of BA is still in its infancy. Thus, this review will clarify our current knowledge of BA supplementation to augment muscle carnosine as well as highlight future research questions on the regulatory points of control for muscle carnosine synthesis. },

The reduction of chain dimension from phase separation would lead to the decrease of the possibility for a molecular in melt to form a tie molecular but an increasing number of short chain branch content was shown to increases strain hardening stiffness or tie chains. Physical chain entanglements were established as another source of inter-lamellar linkages that contribute to ESCR of polyethylene. Within the similar branch content and no phase separation, due to an increasing in plateau modulus was shown to increases hardening stiffness or ESCR of resins. },

  abstract={ A direct-drive shock ignition scheme in the context of the Laser MegaJoule facility has been considered. The irradiation uniformity provided by two laser beam configurations using a total of 10 or 20 quads to drive the first compression phase has been analyzed. Firstly, a numerical method is used to optimize the laser intensity profiles in the context of the illumination approximation model; then these profiles are used to calculate the irradiation non-uniformity of a spherical target of radius r 0 = 1000 μm assuming the beam uncertainties: power imbalance 5%, pointing error 50 μm and target positioning 20 μm. These uncertainties deteriorate the quality of the irradiation increasing considerably the irradiation non-uniformity; moreover, it is found that the pointing error provides the major contribution to the degradation of the irradiation. A strategy to mitigate the negative effect induced by the beam uncertainties is proposed. It consists in using a composite profile in each beam: a first large and flat intensity profile provides a background that reduces pointing error and target positioning effects, whilst a second overlapping profile optimizes the illumination irradiation. It is found that the introduction of the flat background with an intensity of 55% with respect to the maximum intensity reduces by about 40% the non-uniformity of the irradiation due to beam uncertainties. },

Numerical studies (computer experiments) of the salt transfer equation were performed for the equilibrium sorption and linear sorption isotherms in soils with deep and shallow groundwater tables and for nonequilibrium irreversible sorption (characterized by biological transformation in the soil solution following the first-order kinetics) to examine the effect of the upper and lower boundary conditions on the transfer of salts in a soil. The analysis revealed relationships between the parameters of the convective diffusion equation (for which simpler equations were proposed for calculating the irrigation rates from the average salt content in the soil layer before and after washing), which included the filtration rate, the physicochemical features of the soil and salts, and the degree and depth of the preset desalination. The use of the initial and permissible salt concentrations averaged for the studied layer was substantiated for the first time. After wide experimental validation, the obtained equations can be used in soil-reclamation practice. },

  abstract={ We consider strongly nonlinear long waves on the surface of a homogeneous fluid layer. By modifying the formulation for the high-order spectral (HOS) method for waves in water of finite depth, we present a higher-order nonlinear system for the surface elevation and the velocity potential on the free surface to describe the two-dimensional evolution of large amplitude long waves. It is shown that the resulting system preserves the Hamiltonian structure of the Euler equations and can be transformed to the strongly nonlinear long-wave model for the depth-averaged velocity. Due to truncation of the linear dispersion relation for water waves, both the system for the surface velocity potential and that for the depth-averaged velocity are ill-posed when the order of approximation is odd and even, respectively. To avoid this ill-posedness, fully dispersive models are also proposed. Under the same order approximation, the long-wave model is found more effective for numeral studies of large amplitude long waves than the finite-depth model. },

  abstract={ Multi-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) of astrophysical detonations in degenerate matter have revealed that the nuclear burning is typically characterized by cellular structure caused by transverse instabilities in the detonation front. Type Ia supernova modelers often use onedimensional DNS of detonations as inputs or constraints for their whole star simulations.While these one-dimensional studies are useful tools, the true nature of the detonation is multi-dimensional. The multi-dimensional structure of the burning influences the speed, stability, and the composition of the detonation and its burning products, and therefore, could have an impact on the spectra of Type Ia supernovae. Considerable effort has been expended modeling Type Ia supernovae at densities above 1×107 g·cm−3 where the complexities of turbulent burning dominate the flame propagation. However, most full star models turn the nuclear burning schemes off when the density falls below 1×107 g·cm−3 and distributed burning begins. The deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) is believed to occur at just these densities and consequently they are the densities important for studying the properties of the subsequent detonation. This work will review the status of DNS studies of detonations and their possible implications for Type Ia supernova models. It will cover the development of Detonation theory from the first simple Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation models to the current models based on the time-dependent, compressible, reactive flow Euler equations of fluid dynamics. },

A questionnaire was completed by participants, including the pattern of using mobile phones and their disinfection. The number of participants was 120 students and professors in each of dental and engineering schools. Swabs from mobile phones of the participants were taken and plated on culture medium. The t-test, Chi-Square with the SPSS 11.5 program were used in data analysis. In total, 240 mobile phones were cultured for microorganisms, while 65.8% (n = 158) were culture-positive. One hundred percent of professors, 98% of students’ dental school and 72% of professors and 62% of students of engineering, believe that mobile can serve as a source of pathogens. The most commonly cultured organisms were Staphylococcus Aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus Faecalis, and Pseudomonas. The current study showed that none of the mobile phones of the professors and students of the engineering university was infected by Pseudomonas and Candida albicans. The results of this study showed that mobile phones may act as an important source of nosocomial pathogens. },

  abstract={ Understanding the heterogeneity of infiltration has been a challenging issue in improving knowledge of hillslope hydrology. Spatial distributions of the hydraulic properties on a hillslope were measured using tension infiltrometers over four different time periods. The hillslope examined has a permanent channel initiation point located in the Bongsunsa watershed, which is a headwater for the Han River basin, South Korea. Surface hydraulic conductivity is affected by both pore development structure and soil texture. In order to explore the impact of the relationship between spatial topographical features and the surface hydraulic properties, several terrain analyses and flow evaluations were performed. The importance of flow through a larger pore size was confirmed in both the scale and variation of the spatial and seasonal perspectives, respectively. Although there is a substantial heterogeneity of field measurements in both spatial and temporal contexts, the threshold for characterizing the spatial variation of hydraulic properties can be obtained through several statistical tests, using two distinct data subsets delineated from an analysis of the terrain attributes and hydraulic properties. Results reveal that threshold behavior appears to be restricted for hydraulic properties associated with the generation of the flow through macropores. },

  abstract={ Interleukin-38 (IL-38) is the most recent member of the IL-1 family that acts as a natural inflammatory inhibitor by binding to cognate receptors, particularly the IL-36 receptor. In vitro, animal and human studies on autoimmune, metabolic, cardiovascular and allergic diseases, as well sepsis and respiratory viral infections, have shown that IL-38 exerts an anti-inflammatory activity by modulating the generation and function of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and IL-36) and regulating dendritic cells, M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Accordingly, IL-38 may possess therapeutic potential for these types of diseases. IL-38 down-regulates CCR3+ eosinophil cells, CRTH2+ Th2 cells, Th17 cells, and innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2), but up-regulates Tregs, and this has influenced the design of immunotherapeutic strategies based on regulatory cells/cytokines for allergic asthma in future studies. In auto-inflammatory diseases, IL-38 alleviates skin inflammation by regulating γδ T cells and limiting the production of IL-17. Due to its ability to suppress IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-36, this cytokine could reduce COVID-19 severity, and might be employed as a therapeutic tool. IL-38 may also influence host immunity and/or the components of the cancer microenvironment, and has been shown to improve the outcome of colorectal cancer, and may participate in tumour progression in lung cancer possibly by modulating CD8 tumour infiltrating T cells and PD-L1 expression. In this review, we first briefly present the biological and immunological functions of IL-38, and then discuss the important roles of IL-38 in various types of diseases, and finally highlight its use in therapeutic strategies. },

The AVIRIS—NG image spectra of major metasedimentary rocks were compared with their respective laboratory spectra to identify few diagnostic spectral features or absorption features of the rocks. These spectral features were translated from laboratory to image and consistently present in the image spectra of these rocks across the area. After ensuring the persistency of absorption features from sample to image pixels, three AVIRIS—NG based spectral indices is proposed to delineate calcareous (dolomite), siliceous (quartzite) and argillaceous (phyllite) metasedimentary rocks. The index image composite was compared with the reference lithological map of Geological Survey of India and also was validated in the field. The study demonstrates the efficiency of AVIRIS — NG data for mapping metasedimentary units from the Aravalli Supergroup that are known to host strata bound mineral deposits. },

  abstract={ Thermal management is a growing challenge for electronics packaging because of increased heat fluxes and device miniaturization. Thermal interface materials (TIMs) are used in electronic devices to transfer heat between two adjacent surfaces. TIMs need to exhibit high thermal conductivity and must be soft to minimize thermal contact resistance. Polymers, despite their relative softness, suffer from low thermal conductivity (∼0.2 W/m-K). To overcome this challenge, we infiltrate nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates with molten polymer to fabricate large area arrays of vertically aligned polymer nanofibers. Nanoscale confinement effects and flow induced chain elongation improve polymer chain alignment (measured using polarized Raman spectroscopy) and thermal conductivity (measured using the photoacoustic method) along the fiber’s long axis. Conjugated poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and non- conjugated polyethylene (PE) of various molecular weights are explored to establish a relationship between polymer structure, nanofiber diameter, and the resulting thermal conductivity. In general, thermal conductivity improves with decreasing fiber diameter and increasing polymer molecular weight. Thermal conductivity of approximately 7 W/m-K was achieved for both the ∼200 nm diameter HDPE fibers and the 100 nm diameter P3HT fibers. These results pave the way for optimization of the processing conditions to produce high thermal conductivity fiber arrays using different polymers, which could potentially be used in thermal interface applications. },

  abstract={ The aphrodisiac property of Eurycoma longifolia has led to an increase in the demand for its Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPs). However, the efficiency of such HMPs depends on the usage of their genuine raw materials. The conventional methods cannot identify species in processed form. The authentication of HMPs can be achieved effectively using DNA barcoding as the method species-specific. However, the use of this method solely relied on the extraction of high-quality DNA from the HMPs. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a satisfactory method for extracting high-quality DNA from the HMPs. Here, four DNA extraction methods were compared to evaluate the best protocol in yield, purity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, sequencing, and species identification. The spectrophotometer analysis showed that the Nucleospin Plant II extraction kit has the best purity as this can be severely affected by the presence of various contaminants in the HMPs. Our findings reveal that DNA purity was more important as a predictor for PCR amplification than yield. Therefore, the present study results demonstrate that the Nucleospin Plant II extraction kit is the best because it produces the purest, amplifiable, and sequenceable DNA for identification and authentication of E. Longifolia HMPs. },

Ethyl acetate fraction reduced the nociceptive face-rubbing behavior during the two phase of the formalin test, whereas pretreatment with rosmarinic acid decreased the pain behavior in the second phase. Ethyl acetate fraction produced significant antinociceptive effects in the capsaicin and glutamate tests.

  abstract={ Acetaminophen, also known as N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), is commonly used as an antipyretic and analgesic agent. APAP overdose can induce hepatic toxicity, known as acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI). However, therapeutic doses of APAP can also induce AILI in patients with excessive alcohol intake or who are fasting. Hence, there is a need to understand the potential pathological mechanisms underlying AILI. In this review, we summarize three main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AILI: hepatocyte necrosis, sterile inflammation, and hepatocyte regeneration. The relevant factors are elucidated and discussed. For instance, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) protein adducts trigger mitochondrial oxidative/nitrosative stress during hepatocyte necrosis, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released to elicit sterile inflammation, and certain growth factors contribute to liver regeneration. Finally, we describe the current potential treatment options for AILI patients and promising novel strategies available to researchers and pharmacists. This review provides a clearer understanding of AILI-related mechanisms to guide drug screening and selection for the clinical treatment of AILI patients in the future. },

Experiments were performed by selecting healthy males and females within the ages of 20 and 60 according to certain standards. Since the circle program among haptic system programs was made by considering the most basic motions among daily life motions, this research was performed by using the circle program. The experimental data on the trajectory errors of the circle motions and the amount of muscular motion were standardized by classifying them into age groups, gender, changes of the viscosity (No viscosity, +viscosity, −viscosity), eight types of the motion (FEL, FFL, FFM, FEM, RFL, REL, REM, and RFM), and two types of muscle (Biceps Brachii: BB, Triceps Brachii: TB). },

The main objective of the present study was to analyze and compare the levels of limonoid aglycones in seeds, callus cultures (originating from seeds), callus cultures (originating from hypocotyls), cell suspensions from hypocotyls cells, and cell suspensions from cotyledons. The cell cultures or C. sinensis were obtained by inoculating two strains of callus in MS medium supplemented with 2.0 (xM 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 7.0 (xM benzyl aminopurine, and 3% (w/v) sucrose in the dark. The highest concentrations of limonoid aglycone that were obtained were observed in cotyledon cell lines (240 mg/100 g dry weight) that were produced on day 21 of culture and hypocotyl cell lines on day 7(210 mg/100 g dry weight). Explants of different origins under the same culture conditions had different limonoid aglycone content. The present results may suggest strategies for enhancing the productivity of biologically important limonoid aglycones and investigating the complex pathways of these secondary metabolites in plant tissue cultures. },

Additionally, the effects of enzymatic hydrolysis on Lactobacillus fermentation characteristics and metabolites of ginsenoside were investigated. The ginseng leaves were found to be more suitable for the raw material of fermented ginseng products because ginseng leaves have higher carbohydrate and crude saponin content than ginseng roots. The optimized conditions were found as particle size of ginseng raw material below 0.15 mm, pH 5.0–5.5, reaction temperature of 55–60 °C, Ceremix concentration of 1%, and reaction time of 2 h. It was shown that the polysaccharides of ginseng were hydrolysed to oligosaccharide by the enzymatic hydrolysis of ginseng leaves, stems and roots. The total oligosaccharide content increased by the enzyme treatment up to 2.2-fold, 5.3-fold and 2.3-fold in ginseng leaves, stems and roots, respectively, compared to control (no treatment). It was found that the enzymatic treatment promoted the Lactobacillus growth, resulting in more significant change in total oligosaccharide consumption and total acidity. The content of several metabolites of ginsenoside, such as Compound K, Rg1, Rh1 and Rg3, was selectively increased by combining the enzymatic treatment and Lactobacillus fermentation. Especially, in the case of enzyme treatment using ginseng leaves, Compound K formation was enhanced up to three-fold compared to control (no treatment). Moreover, in case of combined treatment of enzyme and fermentation, Compound K formation was significantly promoted up to ten-fold. },

Articular inflammation was induced by intra-articular injection of methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) in the knee joint of immunized male C57BL/6J mice. The animals were pre-treated with PTD-OH or PTD-NO (500 mg/kg, per os, — 1 h). Nociceptive threshold was measured using an electronic von Frey apparatus. The total number of leukocytes in the synovial cavity was determined. Concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and CXCL-1 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were determined in periarticular tissue. Both PTD-OH and PTD-NO inhibited at similar extent the mechanical allodynia, neutrophil recruitment to the synovial cavity and periarticular tissue and TNF-α and CXCL-1 production induced by intra-articular challenge with mBSA in immunized mice. PTD-OH and PTD-NO exhibit a marked activity in a murine model of antigen-induced articular inflammation in immunized animals. These results reinforce the interest in the investigation of phthalimide analogs devoid of the glutarimide ring as candidates to analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. },

Forty-five children were divided into three groups: the ANSD group (n=15), the sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) group (n=15), and the normal hearing group (n=15). The ANSD group had a mean age of 48.2 (±29.4) months and included children with moderate-to-severe hearing loss, a history of bilateral hearing aid use for at least 6 months, and absence of comorbid disorders. The SNHL group was closely matched to the ANSD group. Verification of hearing aids was carried out twice with 6 months of interval and included evaluation of aided sound field and P1-CAEP, and evaluation using the Arabic version of the Infant Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS). The P1-CAEPs were elicited using the temporally modified synthetic ‘ba’ and ‘da’ syllables. In the initial evaluation, 80% of ANSD children showed P1 response to the ‘ba’ stimulus and 87% of children to the ‘da’ stimulus. Only one child from the SNHL group did not show P1-CAEP responses to the ‘da’ stimulus. The latency of P1 was prolonged in both groups compared with the normal hearing loss group. At 6-month evaluation, the P1-CAEP latencies improved equally in the ANSD and SNHL groups. Children with absent responses persisted to have absent responses. The mean IT-MAIS scores was initially 45.5 (±20) in the ANSD group and 79 (±9) in the SNHL group and increased after 6 months in both groups. The IT-MAIS scores negatively correlated with the P1-CAEP latency in the two evaluation sessions and positively correlated with the age of hearing aid fitting. Around 50% of ANSD children demonstrated benefit from amplification. They showed evidence of normal central auditory maturation and progress in auditory skill development. Longitudinal P1 recording is recommended in the comprehensive audiological test battery in ANSD population using temporally modified speech stimuli. },

Nine full scale beam-to-column connections were tested under constant amplitude and variable amplitude cyclic loading. The effects of loading amplitude, loading history, and peak load on the connection damage were analyzed. The damage characters were studied and three damage evolution models were calibrated and validated based on test results. The damage mechanism was investigated and an effective plastic strain index was developed to evaluate connection damage based on a ductile fracture mechanism.

  abstract={ Human dignity is introduced in the humanistic management school to distinguish humanistic from economistic perspectives on organizational business practices. Placing human dignity at the core of management leads to a different outlook on doing business, organizing and leading. Within the humanistic management literature, there are several distinct paths to ground human dignity in humanistic management. One school views human dignity as a form of motivation, another focuses on its value-laden components, and still others view human dignity as a form of human development. We introduce relational anthropology as a fourth possibility, emphasizing relationality in the notion of human dignity, with love at its core as the essence of human experience. However, as the experience of human dignity is universally human, culturally specific and extremely personal, interpretations of experienced dignity could be very different for different people. We continue to discuss a cosmopolitan view on human dignity, in which we reject both naïve universalism and lazy relativism, pointing to the challenge of leading moral plurality. We close by summarizing the different approaches to human dignity in a conciliatory framework and outline why we believe an explicit emphasis on qualitative, phenomenological research is the best way forward, bringing love to the stage as the potentially unifying principle for humanistic management. },

  abstract={ With the development of Internet, the amount of data increases exponentially. With the development of network technology, human beings have entered the era of big data. Therefore, it is very important to find valuable information from massive network data. At present, most of the network security products in the market record the system test results in the form of logs. Users can view and analyze the log information one by one to find out the suspicious behavior and carry out the next diagnosis. Finally, they can defend the identified attacks. Intrusion detection system usually stores detection results in the form of alert files. There may be a large number of redundant or false alarm information in the alarm file, so the heavy cognitive burden of users has become one of the disadvantages of traditional intrusion detection system. In consideration of the above situation, visualization technology has been introduced into the field of network security by researchers. The network visualization analysis displays the massive network data and log information in the way of graph and image, and uses the developed human vision to process the massive graphical data. Data visualization is a method of transforming abstract symbols into concrete geometric figures, which presents the results of simulation and calculation in the form of figures and images. In this paper, multi-agent model is used to build a network data visualization analysis model. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can effectively visualize a large number of network data, and the experimental results are easy to understand. },

The NRMSEs in simulated CC and SWC in different treatments were 4.1–19.6 and 6.3–14.1%, respectively, that corresponds to overall averages of 0.92 and 0.84 for R2 in CC and SWC. In exception to severe water stress treatments, the model showed overestimation trend on biomass and yield, and proved satisfactory performance. The maximum simulated biomass and yield was 12.88 and 6.04 t/ha, respectively. The lower values in yield and biomass belong to less water applied treatments, that shows the model accuracy declines in high water deficiency. Simulated biomass WUEs varied from 2.26 to 3.73 kg/m3, likewise the yield WUEs varied from 1.06 to 1.71 kg/m3. The higher WUEs obtained in less water applied treatments, obviously, the WUE increases when applications of water decreased. The findings of water saving potential (WSP), recommended 0.75 of ETc to saved 25.09% of water with only 12.00 and 15.52% reduction in measured and simulated yield. },

  abstract={ The protein kinase Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) is a nexus for the regulation of eukaryotic cell growth. TOR assembles into one of two distinct signalling complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 (mTORC1/2 in mammals), with a set of largely non-overlapping protein partners. (m)TORC1 activation occurs in response to a series of stimuli relevant to cell growth, including nutrient availability, growth factor signals and stress, and regulates much of the cell’s biosynthetic activity, from proteins to lipids, and recycling through autophagy. mTORC1 regulation is of great therapeutic significance, since in humans many of these signalling complexes, alongside subunits of mTORC1 itself, are implicated in a wide variety of pathophysiologies, including multiple types of cancer, neurological disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders including diabetes. Recent years have seen numerous structures determined of (m)TOR, which have provided mechanistic insight into (m)TORC1 activation in particular, however the integration of cellular signals occurs upstream of the kinase and remains incompletely understood. Here we have collected and analysed in detail as many as possible of the molecular and structural studies which have shed light on (m)TORC1 repression, activation and signal integration. A molecular understanding of this signal integration pathway is required to understand how (m)TORC1 activation is reconciled with the many diverse and contradictory stimuli affecting cell growth. We discuss the current level of molecular understanding of the upstream components of the (m)TORC1 signalling pathway, recent progress on this key biochemical frontier, and the future studies necessary to establish a mechanistic understanding of this master-switch for eukaryotic cell growth. },

  abstract={ Athletic programs are more frequently turning to computerized cognitive tools in order to increase efficiencies in concussion assessment. However, assessment using a traditional neuropsychological test battery may provide a more comprehensive and individualized evaluation. Our goal was to inform sport clinicians of the best practices for concussion assessment through a systematic literature review describing the psychometric properties of standard neuropsychological tests and computerized tools. We conducted our search in relevant databases including Ovid Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Journal articles were included if they evaluated psychometric properties (e.g., reliability, sensitivity) of a cognitive assessment within pure athlete samples (up to 30&nbsp;days post-injury). Searches yielded 4,758 unique results. Ultimately, 103 articles met inclusion criteria, all of which focused on adolescent or young adult participants. Test–retest reliability estimates ranged from .14 to .93 for computerized tools and .02 to .95 for standard neuropsychological tests, with strongest correlations on processing speed tasks for both modalities, although processing speed tasks were most susceptible to practice effects. Reliability was improved with a 2-factor model (processing speed and memory) and by aggregating multiple baseline exams, yet remained below acceptable limits for some studies. Sensitivity to decreased cognitive performance within 72&nbsp;h of injury ranged from 45%–93% for computerized tools and 18%–80% for standard neuropsychological test batteries. The method for classifying cognitive decline (normative comparison, reliable change indices, regression-based methods) affected sensitivity estimates. Combining computerized tools and standard neuropsychological tests with the strongest psychometric performance provides the greatest value in clinical assessment. To this end, future studies should evaluate the efficacy of hybrid test batteries comprised of top-performing measures from both modalities. },

  abstract={ The development of p-i-n structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs) requires more extensive explorations on seeking efficient, low cost and stable hole transporting materials (HTMs). Small molecular HTMs are superior to polymeric ones in terms of synthetic reproducibility as well as purity. However, thin films composed of small molecules are usually labile during the solution-based perovskite deposition. Herein, we propose a molecular engineering strategy of incorporating oligothiophene as conjugation bridge to develop robust oligomer HTMs for p-i-n type PSCs. Upon increasing the oligothiophene chain length from α-bithiophene to α-quaterthiophene and α-hexathiophene, their HOMO energy levels remain unchanged, but their solubility in common organic solvents decreased remarkably, thus greatly enhancing their tolerance to the perovskite deposition. The rational design of oligothiophene chain length can effectively tune their optoelectronic properties as well as thin film stability under polar solvent soaking. The best performance is achieved by an α-quaterthiophene based HTM (QT), showing a high efficiency of 17.69% with fill factor of 0.81, which are comparable to those of a commercially available benchmark polymer HTM (poly[bis (4-phenyl)(2,4-dimethylphenyl) amine], PTAA) based devices fabricated under the same conditions. Our developed oligomer system not only provides the definite molecular structures like small molecule-type HTMs, but also exhibits the excellent film-forming like polymer-type HTMs, thus achieving the well-balanced parameters among solvent tolerance, thin film conductivity, and interfacial charge transfer efficiency, especially building up a platform to develop low cost and reproducible efficient HTMs in p-i-n structured perovskite solar cells. },

Here, we present results from further improvement to land cover mapping and impact analysis of spatial resolution on area estimation for different land cover types. We proposed a set of methods to aggregate two existing 30 m resolution circa 2010 global land cover maps, namely FROM-GLC (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring-Global Land Cover) and FROM-GLC-seg (Segmentation), with two coarser resolution global maps on development, i.e., Nighttime Light Impervious Surface Area (NL-ISA) and MODIS urban extent (MODIS-urban), to produce an improved 30 m global land cover map—FROM-GLC-agg (Aggregation). It was post-processed using additional coarse resolution datasets (i.e., MCD12Q1, GlobCover2009, MOD44W etc.) to reduce land cover type confusion. Around 98.9% pixels remain 30 m resolution after some post-processing to this dataset. Based on this map, majority aggregation and proportion aggregation approaches were employed to create a multi-resolution hierarchy (i.e., 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, 5 km, 10 km, 25 km, 50 km, 100 km) of land cover maps to meet requirements for different resolutions from different applications. Through accuracy assessment, we found that the best overall accuracies for the post-processed base map (at 30 m) and the three maps subsequently aggregated at 250 m, 500 m, 1 km resolutions are 69.50%, 76.65%, 74.65%, and 73.47%, respectively. Our analysis of area-estimation biases for different land cover types at different resolutions suggests that maps at coarser than 5 km resolution contain at least 5% area estimation error for most land cover types. Proportion layers, which contain precise information on land cover percentage, are suggested for use when coarser resolution land cover data are required. },

  abstract={ Non-native plants are often found in the transition between the high salt marsh and upland zones of southern California salt marshes. Although plants in these transition zones experience high levels of abiotic stress associated with high salinity and seasonally variable moisture levels, non-native plants are often able to germinate during brief periods of lowered soil salinity that occur after winter rain. In this study, the germination response of four non-native plants (Glebionis coronaria, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Atriplex semibaccata, and Bassia hyssopifolia) was tested in a growth chamber at a range of soil salinity and moisture conditions found within this zone. Glebionis coronaria and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum were restricted to a narrow range of less stressful soil conditions, with successfully germination generally only at soil salinity values of 10&nbsp;ppt or lower, and germination greatly diminished by low moisture levels. Atriplex semibaccata and Bassia hyssopifolia had successful germination at a wider range of soil conditions. The pattern of lower germination with low moisture levels was less pronounced for these species, and successful germination occurred at soil salinity levels of 20&nbsp;ppt and 30&nbsp;ppt, respectively. This indicates that non-native plants in the salt marsh vary in the extent to which germination is constrained by seasonal change in soil conditions. These results suggest that the potential management technique of controlling non-native plants through salt addition might not be effective for all non-native species. Species with a greater tolerance for high soil salinity and low moisture conditions might become more successful in the future, as rising sea levels and increase in drought conditions associated with global climate change create conditions that favor these species. },

  abstract={ Jack pine-dominated ecosystems in northern Lower Michigan are heavily managed using a harvesting and planting regime designed to provide breeding habitat for the federally endangered Kirtland’s warbler. These plantations do not resemble naturally-regenerated patterns of jack pine, but few data exist after which alternate planting configurations may be modeled. Our objective was to use quantitative analyses to construct new planting configurations that better mimic the spatial patterns of natural post-fire regeneration. We used high-resolution color imagery of a 2000 wildfire to map jack pine saplings and the point density function in ArcMap to quantify the spatial heterogeneity that follows large wildfires in this region. Based on metrics calculated from this analysis of landscape pattern, we used a neutral modeling approach to develop prototypical planting configurations. Jack pine regeneration in the burned area occurred as a series of high-density patches within a matrix of moderate- to low-density regeneration. In contrast, the planted areas were dominated by a single, high-density class with large patch sizes and little heterogeneity. We were able to construct neutral models that were not significantly different from the actual landscape using the metrics we calculated. Though highly successful for Kirtland’s warbler habitat, current jack pine plantations in northern Lower Michigan do not emulate natural post-fire patterns. Quantifying the spatial pattern of regeneration following wildfires may inform neutral landscape models, which will be important tools for managers as they attempt to better emulate natural patterns within plantation design. },

However, the large dark current seriously hinders the improvement of device performance. Alloying is an important means to control the physical properties of topological insulators. In this work, we have designed and prepared Bi1.3In0.7Se3 crystals. The optoelectronic properties of the individual Bi1.3In0.7Se3 nanowire-based photodetector are systematically investigated. The photodetector is very sensitive to broadband wavelength from solar-blind ultraviolet C (254 nm) to near-infrared (1,064 nm), showing superior optoelectrical properties with photoresponsivity of 241.3 A·W−1 and detectivity of 1.18 × 1012 Jones at 638 nm. Furthermore, the photodetector demonstrates ultrafast photoresponse characteristics with a photoresponse time of about 770 ns, which is 3 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than other compound semiconductors based on Bi or In reported so far. In addition, it also exhibits good polarization sensitivity in a broadband range from ultraviolet C (266 nm) to near-infrared (1,064 nm) and obtained the maximum dichroic ratio is 1.73 at 1,064 nm. Our results suggest that this platform creates new opportunities for the development of low-cost, high-sensitivity, high-speed, and broadband angle-sensitive photodetectors. },

This research focused on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) under a biological watershed management practice in the Taleghan paired watershed, namely, treated (TW) and control watersheds (CW), in Alborz province, Iran. In this research, along with the remote sensing techniques, the soil moisture and vegetation cover data were measured and statistically analyzed in the three aspects of both TW and CW during a growth period from May to October 2017. The results indicated that soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature values in the paired watershed were significantly different at the 0.01 level during the study period. The increased vegetation cover in the TW had an inverse effect on the land surface temperature and TVDI, while directly impacted the soil moisture content. The average TVDI in the CW was 0.83, while this index was found to be 0.69 in the TW. Unlike the vegetation cover and soil moisture, the results revealed that the southern aspects had the highest TVDI and land surface temperature compared to the northern and eastern aspects of both watersheds. However, the increased vegetation cover as a biological watershed management activity in the steep terrain and mountainous areas of TW led to an increased soil moisture and a decreased land surface temperature and soil dryness. As a result, decreasing soil dryness in the TW can exert vital controls on the water resources and increasing water availability. In the arid and semiarid countries such as Iran, a proper watershed management activity can effectively increase soil moisture and water availability in the watersheds. In particular, the vegetation cover protection and biological practices can be considered as practical solutions in the rehabilitation of exhausted watersheds in arid and semiarid environments. },

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30&nbsp;g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological,&nbsp;muscular, cartilage,&nbsp;neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system.

There are yet many inexplicable physiochemical properties of MDI-BDO–based hard polyurethane segments such as the geometry, cis–trans isomerism, electronic structure, chemical reactivity, the inter-hard-segment interactions, and the photo-response. In the present study, it was attempted to develop and validate a model system that would facilitate further research on the structural and chemical properties of the MDI-BDO hard segments. It was found that the trans isomer of urethane bond is more stable than the cis isomer, and it is argued here that thermal transformation from trans to cis not possible due to the high rotational energy barrier. The differences between the calculated IR spectra of the cis and trans isomers are proposed as a powerful differentiation tool. The calculated Fukui indices show that cis and trans isomers are different in their chemical reactivity. The findings of the present study suggest intermolecular and intramolecular pi-stacking and highly plausible two significant types of hydrogen bond types between hard segments. In the present study, a model system for MDI-BDO hard segment was developed and successfully validated via computational experiments. Further calculations done with the new model provided an indispensable understanding of the structure, cis–trans isomerism, reactivity, and intermolecular interactions of the MDI-BDO hard segments. The proposed model can be further improved in the future by incorporating suitable soft segments. In summary, the model system developed and validated in the present study has provided new opportunities to understand and further study the structural and chemical features of the hard segments of the MDI-BDO–based polyurethane. },

We searched MEDLINE and the specialized LUDOK database for studies published between 01.01.2011 and 11.05.2017 investigating health effects of ambient air pollution-related UFP. We included epidemiologic studies containing UFP measures and quantifiable measures of associations. Relevant data were extracted on the basis of previously developed evaluation criteria.

Panel (n = 32), scripted exposure with predefined settings (n = 16) or time series studies (n = 11) were most frequent. Thirty-four studies adjusted for at least one other pollutant. Most consistent associations were identified for short-term effects on pulmonary/systemic inflammation, heart rate variability and blood pressure. The evidence suggests adverse short-term associations with inflammatory and cardiovascular changes, which may be at least partly independent of other pollutants. For the other studied health outcomes, the evidence on independent health effects of UFP remains inconclusive or insufficient. },

  abstract={ We measured the effects of a plant invasion (Phragmites australis) on resident fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) in New England salt marshes by assessing diet quality at the food web base and by quantifying the importance of primary producers to secondary production using a recently developed Bayesian mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R, “SIAR”). Spartina alterniflora, the dominant native plant, exhibited significantly greater leaf toughness and higher C/N ratios relative to P. australis. Benthic microalgae and phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) exhibited the lowest C/N indicating higher diet quality. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in SIAR by modeling F. heteroclitus at three separate trophic levels (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5) using species-specific discrimination factors to determine basal resource contributions. Overall, the best-fitting models include those that assume F. heteroclitus resides approximately 2.0 trophic levels above primary producers. Using discrimination factors from a range of data sources reported in the literature, our analyses revealed that consumers rely less on benthic microalgae and phytoplankton in restricted marshes (7–23&nbsp;% and 11–44&nbsp;%, respectively) relative to reference marshes (5–34&nbsp;% and 23–48&nbsp;%, respectively), resulting in a shift in diet toward invasive plant consumption (0–27&nbsp;%). This is likely due to increased P. australis cover and marsh surface shading leading to decreased microalgal biomass, combined with reduced flooding of the marsh surface that favors terrestrial invertebrate assemblages. Restoration decreased the quantity of P. australis in the food web (0–15&nbsp;%) and increased the importance of microalgae (1–30&nbsp;%), phytoplankton (19–48&nbsp;%), and native plants (23–63&nbsp;%), indicating a shift in ecological recovery toward reference conditions. },

  abstract={ The posttranscriptional addition of nontemplated nucleotides to the 3′ ends of RNA molecules can have a significant impact on their stability and biological function. It has been recently discovered that nontemplated addition of uridine or adenosine to the 3′ ends of RNAs occurs in different organisms ranging from algae to humans, and on different kinds of RNAs, such as histone mRNAs, mRNA fragments, U6 snRNA, mature small RNAs and their precursors etc. These modifications may lead to different outcomes, such as increasing RNA decay, promoting or inhibiting RNA processing, or changing RNA activity. Growing pieces of evidence have revealed that such modifications can be RNA sequence-specific and subjected to temporal or spatial regulation in development. RNA tailing and its outcomes have been associated with human diseases such as cancer. Here, we review recent developments in RNA uridylation and adenylation and discuss the future prospects in this research area. },

  abstract={ Interaction of a strong converging shock wave with an SF6 gas bubble is studied, focusing on the effects of shock intensity and shock shape on interface evolution. Experimentally, the converging shock wave is generated by shock dynamics theory and the gas bubble is created by soap film technique. The post-shock flow field is captured by a schlieren photography combined with a high-speed video camera. Besides, a three-dimensional program is adopted to provide more details of flow field. After the strong converging shock wave impact, a wide and pronged outward jet, which differs from that in planar shock or weak converging shock condition, is derived from the downstream interface pole. This specific phenomenon is considered to be closely associated with shock intensity and shock curvature. Disturbed by the gas bubble, the converging shocks approaching the convergence center have polygonal shapes, and the relationship between shock intensity and shock radius verifies the applicability of polygonal converging shock theory. Subsequently, the motion of upstream point is discussed, and a modified nonlinear theory considering rarefaction wave and high amplitude effects is proposed. In addition, the effects of shock shape on interface morphology and interface scales are elucidated. These results indicate that the shape as well as shock strength plays an important role in interface evolution. },

We evaluated here an ultrafast blastocyst warming procedure in order to improve workflow while maintaining clinical outcome. We first evaluated the expression of main markers of lineage specification in a subset of blastocysts donated to research warmed with ultrafast protocol. We then performed a prospective pseudo-randomized pilot study comparing blastocyst survival, reexpansion and live birth rates between standard (3 steps, 15&nbsp;min), and ultrafast warming protocol (1 step, 2&nbsp;min). Finally, survival, reexpansion and live birth rates (LBR) obtained with ultrafast warming protocol were prospectively collected during 3&nbsp;months and compared with previous indicators. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that staining and spatial organization of cell fate markers were conserved with ultrafast protocol. Survival, reexpansion and LBR were strictly comparable between standard (n = 47 cycles) and ultrafast (n = 39 cycles) groups in the pilot study (100 vs 100%, 80 vs 76% and 29.8 vs 30.7% in standard and simplified groups respectively). Survival, expansion and LBR obtained with the ultrafast warming protocol over the next 3-month period (321 cycles, 336 embryos) were comparable with those obtained with the standard protocol throughout the 6&nbsp;months (547 FBT cycles, 578 embryos) preceding shifting protocol (97.6 and 29.6% vs 97.8 and 28.3% respectively, p &gt; 0.05 for both). In conclusion, using an ultrafast blastocyst warming procedure results in similar embryology and clinical outcomes compared with standard protocol, but significantly shortens the technical procedure, ultimately improving the overall lab’s workflow. },

Using soils developed in serpentine and sedimentary parent materials, we tested the interactive effects of Eisenia japonica (Michaelsen) earthworms and 500&nbsp;kg&nbsp;ha−1 of dwarf bamboo charcoal (Sasa kurilensis (Rupr.) Makino et Shibata) in a microcosm incubation that lasted four weeks. Soils were extracted in parallel after the incubation with the BBP method using 0.01&nbsp;M CaCl2 (soluble P), 0.01&nbsp;M citric acid (chelate-extractable P), 0.02 phosphatase enzyme units ml−1 (enzyme-extractable organic P), and 1.0&nbsp;M HCl (mineral occluded P). Dwarf bamboo charcoal alone contained up to 444&nbsp;mg total BBP kg−1 prior to application to soil microcosms. Treatment effects in soil microcosms were highest in sedimentary soil types and where charcoal was combined with earthworms (15.97&nbsp;mg&nbsp;P&nbsp;kg−1&nbsp;±&nbsp;SE 1.23 total inorganic BBP). Recalcitrant inorganic P (HCl extracted) in combination treatments yielded the highest single inorganic BBP measure (12.41&nbsp;mg&nbsp;kg−1&nbsp;±&nbsp;SE 1.11). Our findings suggest that charcoal, as a legacy of wildfire, and native earthworm activity may help stimulate cycling of recalcitrant inorganic BBP pools. },

  abstract={ Inertial fusion energy (IFE) has been considered a promising, nearly inexhaustible source of sustainable carbon-free power for the world’s energy future. It has long been recognized that the control of hydrodynamic instabilities is of critical importance for ignition and high-gain in the inertial-confinement fusion (ICF) hot-spot ignition scheme. In this mini-review, we summarize the progress of theoretical and simulation research of hydrodynamic instabilities in the ICF central hot-spot implosion in our group over the past decade. In order to obtain sufficient understanding of the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities in ICF, we first decompose the problem into different stages according to the implosion physics processes. The decomposed essential physics pro- cesses that are associated with ICF implosions, such as Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI), Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), convergent geometry effects, as well as perturbation feed-through are reviewed. Analyti- cal models in planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometries have been established to study different physical aspects, including density-gradient, interface-coupling, geometry, and convergent effects. The influence of ablation in the presence of preheating on the RTI has been extensively studied by numerical simulations. The KHI considering the ablation effect has been discussed in detail for the first time. A series of single-mode ablative RTI experiments has been performed on the Shenguang-II laser facility. The theoretical and simulation research provides us the physical insights of linear and weakly nonlinear growths, and nonlinear evolutions of the hydrodynamic instabilities in ICF implosions, which has directly supported the research of ICF ignition target design. The ICF hot-spot ignition implosion design that uses several controlling features, based on our current understanding of hydrodynamic instabilities, to address shell implosion stability, has been briefly described, several of which are novel. },

Fifteen isolates of Fusarium oxysporum with varying colony sizes and color pigments were recovered from symptomatic A. mangium seedlings. The pathogenicity test showed that all isolates could infect plants with wilt severity reaching 80%, and the pathogen was verified as causing vascular disease.

Spatial understanding of biomass and carbon stocks in different plant functional types of these forests is important. Structure, diversity, composition, soil features and carbon stocks in six distinct plant functional types, namely: Moist Mixed-Deciduous Forest, Peninsular Sal Forest&nbsp;(PSF), Semi-Evergreen Forest&nbsp;(SEF), Planted Teak Forest, Bamboo Brakes&nbsp;(BB), and Degraded Thorny Shrubby Forest were quantified as secondary tropical deciduous forests of the Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary, Eastern Ghats of Odisha, India. Seventy-one species ≥ 10&nbsp;cm Girth&nbsp;at breast height (GBH) were recorded, belonging to 38 families and 65 genera. Above- ground biomass carbon and soil organic carbon ranged from 2.1–72.7&nbsp;Mg C ha−1 and 20.6–67.1&nbsp;Mg C ha−1, respectively, among all plant functional types. Soil organic carbon and important value index were positively correlated with above- ground biomass carbon. Maximum carbon allocation was in SOC pool (51–91%), followed by the above- ground biomass pool (9–52%), indicating SOC is one of the major carbon sinks in secondary dry forests. The results highlight the importance of secondary tropical deciduous forests in biodiversity conservation and ecological importance in reducing greenhouse gases. },

  abstract={ A major challenge in contemporary research is how to connect medical education and cognitive neuroscience and achieve synergy between these domains. Based on this starting point we discuss how this may result in a common language about learning, more educationally focused scientific inquiry, and multidisciplinary research projects. As the topic of prior knowledge in understanding plays a strategic role in both medical education and cognitive neuroscience it is used as a central element in our discussion. A critical condition for the acquisition of new knowledge is the existence of prior knowledge, which can be built in a mental model or schema. Formation of schemas is a central event in student-centered active learning, by which mental models are constructed and reconstructed. These theoretical considerations from cognitive psychology foster scientific discussions that may lead to salient issues and questions for research with cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience attempts to understand how knowledge, insight and experience are established in the brain and to clarify their neural correlates. Recently, evidence has been obtained that new information processed by the hippocampus can be consolidated into a stable, neocortical network more rapidly if this new information fits readily into a schema. Opportunities for medical education and medical education research can be created in a fruitful dialogue within an educational multidisciplinary platform. In this synergetic setting many questions can be raised by educational scholars interested in evidence-based education that may be highly relevant for integrative research and the further development of medical education. },

It is becoming a popular tool for bioanalytical applications and bioimaging as a competitor of the well-known green fluorescent protein and its analogues. The main limitation of FbFPs is that all the members have close values of their absorption and emission band maxima. Therefore the upcoming challenge is to introduce novel variants of FbFPs to extend their color palette. We report the results of computational studies of iLOV variants, introducing point mutations and chromophore analogues. We found that point mutations of the apoprotein and substitution of FMN with either 8-amino-FMN or 8-methylamino-FMN lead to the red shift of emission bands up to 100 nm. Substitution with 1-deaza-FMN and the point mutations of the apoprotein result in a set of novel fluorescent proteins with emission bands in the “transparent” window where light readily penetrates through mammalian tissues. Newly suggested FbFPs can be used for multicolor imaging and also as components of FRET pairs. },

  abstract={ The photochemical reaction of the LOV1 (light-oxygen-voltage 1) domain of phototropin 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated by the time-resolved transient grating method. As with other LOV domains, an absorption spectral change associated with an adduct formation between its chromophore (flavin mononucleotide) and a cysteine residue was observed with a time constant of 1.1 µs. After this reaction, a significant diffusion coefficient (D) change (D of the reactant = 8.2 × 10−11 m2 s−1, and D of the photoproduct = 6.4 × 10−11 m2 s−1) was observed with a time constant of 14 ms at a protein concentration of 270 µM. From the D value of the ground state and the peak position in size exclusion chromatography, we have confirmed that the phot1LOV1 domain exists as a dimer in the dark. The D-value and the concentration dependence of the rate indicated that the phot1LOV1 domain associates to form a tetramer (dimerization of the dimer) upon photoexcitation. We also found that the chromophore is released from the binding pocket of the LOV domain when it absorbs two photons within a pulse duration, which occurs in addition to the normal photocycle reaction. On the basis of these results, we discuss the molecular mechanism of the light dependent role of the phot1LOV1 domain. },

  abstract={ Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and malignant melanoma are highly aggressive cancers that widely express the cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4/NG2). CSPG4 plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival and promotes chemo- and radiotherapy resistance, suggesting that CSPG4 is an attractive target in cancer therapy. In the present work, we applied the drug delivery technology photochemical internalization (PCI) in combination with the novel CSPG4-targeting immunotoxin 225.28-saporin as an efficient and specific strategy to kill aggressive TNBC and amelanotic melanoma cells. Light-activation of the clinically relevant photosensitizer TPCS2a (fimaporfin) and 225.28-saporin was found to act in a synergistic manner, and was superior to both PCI of saporin and PCI-no-drug (TPCS2a + light only) in three TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and SUM149) and two BRAFV600E mutated malignant melanoma cell lines (Melmet 1 and Melmet 5). The cytotoxic effect was highly dependent on the light dose and expression of CSPG4 since no enhanced cytotoxicity of PCI of 225.28-saporin compared to PCI of saporin was observed in the CSPG4-negative MCF-7 cells. The PCI of a smaller, and clinically relevant CSPG4-targeting toxin (scFvMEL-rGel) validated the CSPG4-targeting concept in vitro and induced a strong inhibition of tumor growth in the amelanotic melanoma xenograft A-375 model. In conclusion, the combination of the drug delivery technology PCI and CSPG4-targeting immunotoxins is an efficient, specific and light-controlled strategy for the elimination of aggressive cells of TNBC and malignant melanoma origin. This study lays the foundation for further preclinical evaluation of PCI in combination with CSPG4-targeting. },

Controlling these instabilities is very desirable, but remains a challenge in applications such as inertial confinement fusion. The field of “shock-gas-layer interaction” has experienced rapid development, driven by advances in experimental and numerical techniques as well as theoretical understanding. This domain has uncovered a diverse array of wave patterns and hydrodynamic instabilities, such as reverberating waves, feedthrough, abnormal and freeze-out Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, among others. Studies have shown that it is possible to suppress these instabilities by appropriately configuring a gas layer. Here we review the recent progress in theories, experiments, and simulations of shock-gas-layer interactions, and the feedthrough mechanism, the reverberating waves and their induced additional instabilities, as well as the convergent geometry and reshock effects, are focused. The conditions for suppressing hydrodynamic instabilities are summarized. The review concludes by highlighting the challenges and prospects for future research in this area. },

Third, we determine the light response of the Beggiatoa sp. photoactivatable adenylate cyclase bPAC in Chinese hamster ovary cells. bPAC is activated by blue light in dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal intensity of 0.58 mW cm−2; intracellular cAMP spikes generated upon bPAC activation decay with a half time of about 5 minutes after light switch-off. Taken together, we present a setup which is easily assembled and which thus offers a facile approach to conducting illumination experiments at high throughput, reproducibility and fidelity. },

  abstract={ Sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease are two rare bone sclerosing disorders characterized by increased bone mineral density, tall stature and entrapment of cranial nerves due to overgrowth of a highly dense bone. Recent advances in human genetics have revealed the genetic background of these disorders by cloning the SOST gene, which is localized on chromosome region 17q12-q21 and codes for sclerostin. Sclerostin is a protein produced almost exclusively from osteocytes inhibiting bone formation by both osteoblasts and osteocytes. At the molecular level, sclerostin inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in osteoblast development and function. Induced sclerostin deficiency in mice reproduces the bone sclerosing human diseases, while sclerostin excess leads to bone loss and reduced bone strength. The extracellular nature of sclerostin has rendered it a promising target for the development of novel anti-osteoporotic treatment. Otherwise healthy carriers of the SOST mutation present with increased bone mass and low levels of sclerostin in serum in contrast to patients with sclerosteosis, who exhibit undetectable levels, thus pointing to the possibility of titration of sclerostin levels in the circulation. Based on these unique characteristics, human anti-sclerostin antibodies have been developed and tested in ovariectomized rats and monkeys, demonstrating very promising results in bone formation. Clinical phase II and III trials are currently underway thereby translating human genetics to drug development. },

  abstract={ Mitochondrial toxicity induced by therapeutic drugs is a major contributor for cardiotoxicity, posing a serious threat to pharmaceutical industries and patients’ lives. However, mitochondrial toxicity testing is not incorporated into routine cardiac safety screening procedures. To accurately model native human cardiomyocytes, we comprehensively evaluated mitochondrial responses of adult human primary cardiomyocytes (hPCMs) to a nucleoside analog, remdesivir (RDV). Comparison of their response to human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes revealed that the latter utilized a mitophagy-based mitochondrial recovery response that was absent in hPCMs. Accordingly, action potential duration was elongated in hPCMs, reflecting clinical incidences of RDV-induced QT prolongation. In a screen for mitochondrial protectants, we identified mitochondrial ROS as a primary mediator of RDV-induced cardiotoxicity. Our study demonstrates the utility of hPCMs in the detection of clinically relevant cardiac toxicities, and offers a framework for hPCM-based high-throughput screening of cardioprotective agents. },

This capability is leading to new insights into how the spatial and temporal coordination of signaling events governs dynamic cell behaviours such as migration and neurite outgrowth. These tools can also be used to dissect a protein’s signaling functions at different organelles. Here we review the properties of photoreceptors from diverse organisms that have been leveraged to control signaling in mammalian cells.

  abstract={ TePixD is a blue-light sensor protein from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (TePixD Tll0078). Although the photochemistry has been examined, so far the photoproduct remains unknown. We have measured the diffusion coefficient (D) of TePixD in the dark by dynamic light scattering and have discovered a very peculiar diffusion property; the decamer oligomer has a larger D than that of the pentamer. Furthermore, D of the pentamer was found to be very close to that of the TePixD decamer photoreaction product. In order to investigate this reaction further, elution profiles of size-exclusion chromatography were measured under dark and illuminated conditions at low (40 µM) and high (1.1 mM) TePixD concentrations. On the basis of these results, we have concluded that the main photoreaction of the TePixD decamer is the dissociation into the pentamer. The secondary structure change associated with this reaction was found to be minor according to circular dichroism analysis. },

All case studies were conducted in a user-centered fashion and build on social semiotics, in which interactive audiobooks are seen as providing new ways to receive, interpret, and share literary texts. Local primary and secondary schools were involved in ethnographic user studies and qualitative evaluations with semi-functioning prototypes. In the main case study presented, social interaction was chosen as key feature to allow high-school students and teachers to annotate audiobooks, then share and comment on the annotations; the social context in this case is a digitally augmented English teaching class. To better investigate the potential of sharable audiobook annotations, we also created a mockup supporting the workflow of the main case study, using standard YouTube annotations and freely available audiobooks. The findings and technical solutions explored in the three studies are the basis for design guidelines aiming at making audiobooks interactive and better integrated in learning contexts. },

  abstract={ Shear stress plays a crucial role in many physiological processes, such as atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, how cells respond to static and dynamical shear stresses remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a structure-based cellular model, consisting of cell membrane, cytoplasm, and cytoskeleton, to explore the shear rheology of cells. By simulating the mechanical responses of a single cell under shear stress, we find that this model can reproduce both the universal power-law rheology at small deformations and stress stiffening at large deformations. Besides, the loss moduli of cells at high frequencies exhibit a stronger frequency dependence than the storage moduli. Moreover, we present two master relations: one is between the power-law exponent and cell stiffness; the other is between cell stiffness and external forces. Our results are in broad agreement with experiments. The self-similar hierarchical theory offers a physical explanation of the power-law responses of cells under shear stress. In addition, we consider the geometrical nonlinearity of single filaments to account for the stress stiffening of cells. The present model can be used to examine the effects of shear flow on living cells in physiological environments. },

In the sonnet ‘Duns Scotus’s Oxford’ and the novel Jude the Obscure, Hopkins and Hardy respectively present the city of Oxford as a central confluence of medieval and early modern pasts with a Victorian present. To further link past and present, the poet and novelist both enter into the medieval conceit of the wind, wherein a lover gains intimacy with the beloved through mutually shared breath, but they do so for cross-purposes. Whereas a connection to the past is preserved in Hopkins’s sonnet by a theological understanding of the ether, any such connection is a dangerous illusion in Hardy’s novel. Yet, even with this divergence, Hardy, like Hopkins, still leads the reader into a shared sacramental intimacy suggested through medieval influences on the novel. },

  abstract={ Cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are photosensory proteins found in cyanobacteria and are distantly related to the widespread phytochromes. Whereas plant phytochromes exhibit responses to red and far-red light, CBCRs use the same photoisomerization of a linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore to respond to a wide range of colors. NpR6012g4 from Nostoc punctiforme and AnPixJ from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 belong to a large subfamily of red/green CBCRs that exhibit a red-absorbing dark state similar to that of phytochrome but a green-absorbing photoproduct rather than a far-red-absorbing one. In these canonical red/green CBCRs, the photoproduct is blue-shifted relative to the orange absorption observed in the absence of native protein structure. This spectral tuning of the photoproduct requires a conserved Phe residue on the second β strand of the CBCR GAF domain, consistent with a trapped-twist mechanism in which the bilin is sterically constrained in the photoproduct. N. punctiforme also produces NpR3784, a CBCR with a similar red/green photocycle to that of NpR6012g4. NpR3784 lacks both the β2 Phe and other residues characteristic of the canonical red/green CBCRs. In the current work, we identify NpR3784 homologs with red/green photocycles in other cyanobacteria. Spectral tuning in this NpR3784 group is accomplished by a different set of conserved Phe residues, including a characteristic Phe residue on β1. This set of Phe residues cannot be interchanged with the Phe residues found in canonical red/green CBCRs such as NpR6012g4. Our results provide new insights into the flexible protein–chromophore interactions used by CBCRs to generate their remarkable spectral diversity. },

  abstract={ In recent years it has become increasingly evident that prokaryotic organisms can sense and react to light stimuli via a variety of photosensory receptors and signal transduction pathways. There are two main superfamilies of non-membrane-bound photoreceptors: the bilin-binding phytochrome-related proteins based on GAF (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, cyanobacterial adenylate cyclases, and transcription activator FhlA) domains (bilin-GAF proteins), and the flavin-binding proteins (FL-Blues), photoperceptive thanks to their LOV (Light, Oxygen and Voltage) and BLUF (Blue Light sensing Using Flavins) domains. In this manuscript we present a comprehensive scenario of the existence of bilin-GAF, LOV and BLUF proteins in the prokaryotic world and inspect possible phylogenetic pathways, also defining novel criteria for identifying gene (and protein) sequences based on experimentally assessed photochemical events. As a whole we have inspected almost 2000 proteins recovered in 985 bacteria and 16 archaea. For LOV and BLUF proteins, ten and, respectively, twelve superconserved amino acids have been identified, which were used as criterion for selection. A similarly strict parameter cannot be applied to the more variegate family of bilin-GAF domains. The co-presence of bilin-GAF and FL-Blues occurs in 22% of the analyzed bacteria, with emphasis on the bilin-GAF/LOV co-presence in cyanobacteria and of bilin-GAF/BLUF in the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group. For construction of phylogeny/distance-trees we used the neighboring-method to obtain a branching pattern, limited to photosensing domains. We observed that in many cases organisms belonging to the same phylum are neighbors, but clustering mostly occurs according to the type of functional domain associated with the photosensing modules. },

This practical action research study utilized data collected from 24 students in a maker class, their peers, 4 teachers, and administrative documents related to school enrollment and student competitions’ records. Results showed that teachers had shifted their teaching from being teacher-centered to student-centered. The students who participated in the M-STEM-PjBL curriculum actively assisted peer learning and initiated active teacher–student interactions. Both teacher and student participants improved their practical skills during the process. Students in the maker science class had more positive attitudes toward science and science learning and changed their peers’ attitudes in the regular science class. The problematic rate of not meeting the required standard in the science subtest of the CAP was reduced from 36 to 26%. Moreover, student participants’ products recommended to the county or national level competitions frequently won awards. Student participants’ creativity and the science teachers’ teaching efforts were recognized in the media. Parent endorsement of the school was increased, the threat of losing students to other schools was decreased, and the crisis of cutting the number of classes was reduced. },

For example, statements about entities such as species, race, memory, intelligence, depression, or obesity are true or false relative to the choice of a biological, psychological, or medical ontology. Second, I show that ontological choices often depend on non-epistemic values. On the basis of these premises, I argue that it is often neither possible nor desirable to evaluate scientific statements independently of non-epistemic values. Finally, I suggest that considerations of ontological choices do not only challenge the value-free ideal but also help to specify positive roles of non-epistemic values in an often neglected area of scientific practice. },

This work provides empirical evidence supporting the claim that studying a computer graphics course, as commonly offered in computer science or engineering programs, can help develop stronger visual-spatial abilities. This benefit was estimated with the assessment of students’ performances in a standardized test of visual-spatial abilities. This empirical pre-test/post-test study ran for three consecutive semesters and involved six computer graphics groups where students were evaluated with the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test to measure whether the full-semester working on contents heavily related to 2D/3D geometric transformations had a positive effect on students’ visual-spatial intelligence. Results show a statistically significant increase in the average score in the test, which in turn suggests that these cognitive abilities could be reinforced or trained through the normal course workload. Additional findings in this study suggest that a retest gaining factor is present just by taking the test twice, and that there is a weak correlation between students’ level of visual-spatial abilities at the beginning of the course and the final grades obtained at the end of the semester. },

  abstract={ In most cases, product development is not inventing a product completely new and from scratch, it typically either adds a few newly developed sub-functions to mainly known sub-functions, or it generates invention based on new combinations of already existing and slightly modified sub-functions. This synthesis is ideally based on a preceding and comprehensive system analysis that is necessary to define promising directions for advancement in further product development. In analysis as well as in synthesis the design engineer needs creativity—either to be able to recognize which functions are realized in a given system that is subject to analysis or to be able to think up new ways how a desired function could be realized in a system. The main cognitive mechanism for creativity is analogy and this mechanism in turn is based on schemas and mental models. In microsystems development, micro specific obstacles accrue when using analogies. In this work, the authors derive the nature and source of these obstacles and their implications on microsystems development. To overcome these obstacles, a functions catalogue is proposed. This catalogue can directly be used to add an external source for analogies during system synthesis. By transferring a method called geometrical similarity search to microsystems technology and combining it with the functions catalogue, system analysis can be supported as well. },

Findings indicate that cognitive CQ has an inverted U-shaped relationship with organizational commitment, while motivational CQ has a positive linear relationship with organizational commitment, and cultural distance moderates the relationships between CQ and commitment such that negative or positive moderation occur contingent on whether the optimal CQ level is reached. Our results suggest the need for identifying an inflection point of individuals’ CQ level to differentiate between the increasing and decreasing trend of organizational commitment in view of the effect of cultural distance. This may help enabling multinationals to leverage expatriates with different levels of CQ to stay committed in multi-cultural environments along the Belt &amp; Road countries. },

  abstract={ Language learners struggle with achieving their highest reading competence, particularly when they sit standardized tests with authentic advanced passages. The related literature shows a significant gap in suggesting specific techniques or strategies for individuals to develop a reading competence. To fill this gap, this study investigated the potential relationship between EFL learners' reading performance and their learning styles. One hundred thirty-seven participants were administered the&nbsp;TOEFL PBT for their recruitment test, at which the reading scores were evaluated and analyzed. Ehrman and Leaver’s Questionnaire (2003) was used to classify participants’ learning styles in an ectenic-synoptic continuum. We used the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient to find any potential correlation between learners' performance and their scores as an ectenic or a synoptic learner. The results revealed a positive correlation between synoptic learners and success in the reading tasks. Consequently, a regression model provided the classification of successful learners at reading tests. Knowing that teachers have a variety of learners in their classes and their preferred learning styles can help course instructors to design activities that will exercise a range of cognitive processes and perspectives. },

  abstract={ Education is a complex system that requires multiple perspectives and levels of analysis to understand its contexts, dynamics, and actors’ interactions, particularly concerning technological innovations. This paper aims to identify some of the most promising trends in blended learning implementations in higher education, the capabilities provided by the technology (e.g., datafication), and the contexts of use of these capabilities. This literature review selected and analyzed forty-five peer-reviewed journal articles. The findings highlight some common capabilities among digital educational technologies. In particular, digital tools or platforms with human-to-machine interaction capabilities may enhance automated processes for blended learning delivery modes. In this context, digital technologies such as video capsules and intelligent tutoring systems may improve learning-teaching activities. First, by providing access to more students and facilitating self-paced online learning activities. Second, by offering an individual path of learning for each student, thus improving out-of-class activities and feedback. Educational technology capabilities (ETC) provide complementary insights to identify the best approach when aligning learning goals in technology-based implementations. Further research will be required to empirically validate these results. },

A methodological study to develop and evaluate a board game, following these stages: 1. Integrative literature review to identify educational technologies on Sexually Transmitted Infections used by imprisoned women; 2. Development of the board game; and 3. Content validation performed by 23 evaluators and semantic evaluation carried out with 10 imprisoned women who were enrolled in a school located within a female prison unit in the city of Recife, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The board game consisted of the following: 01 board; 01 instructions manual; 05 pawns; 52 cards; and 01 dice. A global Content Validity Index of 0.966 was reached in the content validation process performed by health and education professionals. In the validation of the board game content regarding appearance, performed by designers/developers, most of the items obtained a Content Validity Coefficient below 0.85, which resulted in the need for adjustments and a new validation round with these professionals, in which Content Validity Coefficient = 0.917 was obtained. In the semantic evaluation, all the women stated that they improved their knowledge, increased their motivation to attend the class and would like to play the board game again. The “Previna” board game has been validated and can be considered an important pedagogical tool in the construction of knowledge in relation to the prevention, treatment and control of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the female prison context. The quality of this educational technology is directly related to its development based on an appropriate theoretical and methodological framework, in addition to satisfactory feedback from the target audience.

  abstract={ Critical thinking (CT) is among the core abilities students need to acquire to overcome the unprecedented and ever-changing challenges of the 21st century and beyond. To facilitate the attainment of CT, numerous researchers worldwide have conducted empirical studies focusing on leveraging computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) to improve students’ CT. Notwithstanding the existence of empirical studies, meta-analyses that clearly show the overall effect sizes (ESs) of the impacts are wanting. The current meta-analysis aimed at filling this lacuna by examining 30 empirical studies that were conducted between the years 2014 and 2023, stored in databases such as Scopus, the Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar, and search engines such as Google and Ecosia and that met the inclusion criteria. The study included journal articles, conference papers and student theses. The total number of participants in the studies was 2,980, representing 11 countries. The results indicated that CSCL was an effective instructional approach to foster students’ CT with statistically significant levels of overall ES estimates (ES = 0.859, z = 8.55, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [0.661–1.055]). The results also indicated that there was no apparent evidence of publication bias (Egger’s regression = 0.478, p &gt; .05). Instructional activities, technology usage, participants’ level of education, dimensions of CT, intervention duration and sample size were found to significantly moderate the overall ES estimate. Based on the results, recommendations are made regarding effective ways to use digital technology and collaborative learning for honing students’ CT. },

The research is timely, with a general capability focused on critical thinking in the newly implemented F-10 curriculum in Australia. The design of the research was a quasi-experiment with pre- and post-intervention cognitive tests conducted with participating students (n = 655) from nine cohorts in seven high schools. Findings showed significant cognitive gains compared with an age-matched control group over the length of the program. Noteworthy is a correlation between baseline cognitive score and school Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA). We argue that the teaching of thinking be brought into the mainstream arena of educational discourse and that the principles from evidence-based programs such as Thinking Science be universally adopted. },

  abstract={ The assessment of cognitive abilities has been the dominant activity performed by school psychologists since the implementation of the field. As such, the teaching of this skill to future psychologists is arguably the most important function of graduate education. Consequently, understanding graduate programs instruction in this area is extremely important. Given the fact that the last comprehensive survey of what is being taught in the cognitive assessment course in school psychology was approximately 20&nbsp;years ago and the fact that laws governing the practice of psychology have changed (i.e., elimination of the discrepancy model mandate), there exists a need to understand current assessment teaching practices in the field of school psychology. As such, the purpose of this study was to understand the current state of the mandatory cognitive assessment course in school psychology programs. Results from our analysis of syllabi from APA- and NASP-accredited programs indicated that several aspects of training remain consistent with two-decade-old practices even in the face of changing legal options and practitioners’ assessment preferences. More specifically, the most commonly taught instrument was the Wechsler scale with the Sattler and Flanagan texts being the most prolific. This indicates that graduate training practices have remained relatively stable. Implications are discussed in terms of current and future practices in the training and education of psychologists. },

  abstract={ In this paper it is championed that a two stages hypothesis for the evolution of language must take into account a qualified approach to heterochrony and the available information from the archaeological record. As it seems, a protracted childhood and youth was already at work in Homo erectus, but early postnatal brain growth (usually called secondary altriciality) was only available to Homo sapiens. According to these facts, the term hysteron proteron is given here to the reversal that sets off linguistic capacity during the first three years of life, upon the ancient abilities for social, natural and technological knowledge, which were already established during the last 2 Mya BP. The unfolding of linguistic capacity creates the typical effect that ontogeny reverses phylogeny: since late postnatal brain growth, quite recent in evolution, launches in ontogeny before the phylogenetically old processes of playing and learning take place during childhood and youth. Full symbolic abilities may be explained as emerging from older semiotic competences based on iconicity (figuration) and indexicality (metonymy), which would have presumably sustained human life for millennia. Furthermore, it is argued that the formation of linguistic categories follows from that overlaying of extended connectivity linked to early postnatal brain growth, inasmuch as it entangles and transforms previous iconic and referential information: i.e. the ancient semiotic capacities for proprioception, embodiment, extended mimesis and pragmatic knowledge, shaping a sort of self-organization process that provides the formal and semantic properties we find in articulated languages. },

  abstract={ Geographic data are used by United Kingdom (UK) defence for purposes including peacekeeping, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and fighting wars. The geographic extent of defence data covers the world, with greater focus directed towards areas considered to be of current interest. Traditionally, these data have been officially sourced, e.g. via National Mapping Agencies, but there is now increasing interest in the potential of crowdsourced geographic data to supplement authoritative data where they are not available, outdated or incomplete. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) and social media have the potential to provide this needed missing information. This paper presents initial work carried out in identifying the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in defence. We first provide a short description of the role of UK defence and review the existing literature on crowdsourced geographic information in defence, as well as generic VGI quality assessment methods. We then explore the potential of crowdsourced data in real-world applications: the conflation of VGI and social media with official data for effective decision-making in war zones, and the potential for crowdsourcing to increase effective collaboration between machines and humans in disaster situations. Based on our review, we outline specific research challenges for deploying crowdsourced geographic information in defence, focussing on data quality and fitness-for-purpose assessment. Defence-specific constraints include the need for rapid quality assessment processes and the need to communicate high-quality information effectively in situations where rapid decision-making is required. Ethical issues are also of fundamental importance. },

Fatty dystrophy of the hepatopancreas in crayfish and pathology of the pancreas in carp were modeled by administration of alloxan at doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Crayfish received alloxan into the ventral sinus and fish were treated i.p. Liver pathology in fish was modeled by administration of seven doses of paracetamol 15 g/kg over 14 days. Parenteral administration (into the central sinus of crayfish, i.v. in fish, and i.p. in axolotls) of stem and progenitor cells from mammalian donors (mice) at a dose of 10·106 bone marrow cells (BMC) was found to have effects. Fish and crayfish with pathology displayed intensive tissue regeneration and restoration of damaged parenchymatous organs. Administration of stem cells accelerated the process of regeneration of amputated limbs in axolotls. These results extend the potential of medical-biological studies of in vivo models. },

The purpose of this article is to understand the overall perspective (required competencies, challenges, and skills gaps) of knowledge workers’ competencies in the modern economy. An expert panel research method was used, as it allows for more complex research that addresses both observed and unobserved determinants of skill and competency requirements. Based on competency management, the result indicates that critical thinking, interpersonal and emotional skills, inspection and monitoring skills, and basic digital skills are the key competencies required. The resulting consequences of the lack of these competencies are also mentioned. },

The purpose is to use the distance-based rigid graph method to control multi-agent, and ultimately achieve dynamic formation tracking and target interception of multi-agent. Initially, distance-based graph stiffness and back-stepping techniques were considered to address the formation control challenge. This method helps achieve the initial expected formation and effectively complete the formation mission. Leaders continue to chase the moving target, while followers stick to the expected arrangement. The leader then precisely tracks the moving target and surrounds it within the formation. By using Lyapunov stability theory with adaptive control, it is ensured that the total distance meets finite and consistent error limits. Finally, the numerical simulation of the interception plan was carried out by 6 multi-agents and 1 target at different times to verify the effectiveness of the control method. },

  abstract={ Traditional research on vehicular edge computing often ignores the challenges brought by the rapid movement of vehicles and the dynamic characteristics of the environment, and often ignores that different vehicles on the same path may generate the same computing tasks, resulting in a large number of repeated calculations. Therefore, this paper proposes a vehicular edge computing content caching solution using content prediction and D4PG. Considering the complexity of the vehicular edge environment, this study proposes a digital twin-assisted method to digitally simulate the vehicular edge environment to assist in the decision-making process related to traffic prediction and content caching strategy. In response to the problems of high-speed vehicle movement and dynamic environmental changes, this paper proposes an informer-based traffic prediction model, which uses the informer prediction model to predict the environment and provide information for vehicle task content caching. At the same time, considering the problem that different vehicles on the same path may generate the same computing tasks, this paper proposes a content caching model based on distributed deterministic policy gradient (D4PG), and uses the D4PG content caching model to determine the content caching strategy. Experimental results show that this scheme can effectively reduce the vehicle task processing delay. },

In order to identify these educational practices, we conducted a review of the existing literature, comprising a systematic search of the Education Resources Information Center and Web of Science databases for studies from the last 25&nbsp;years. Only empirical studies that investigated the impact of interventions were included. Applying these criteria resulted in the inclusion of seventeen studies. Four different educational practices were shown to have a positive impact on cognitive learning outcomes: providing dynamic feedback, enhancing self-regulated learning, adjusting the curriculum and providing differentiated instruction. The impact of educational practices on affective-motivational learning outcomes was inconclusive. Based on this review, we conclude that teachers can help high-ability students in mixed-ability classrooms in grades one to six across various educational contexts using the educational practices reported in this study. },

The studies were undertaken as part of the requirements for their 2-year M.Ed. program from the Aga Khan University, Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED), Pakistan. The teachers enrolled in the program are expected to conduct a small-scale study as part of their thesis requirement which counts for 16 credits or 25% of the program. Twenty studies from a total of 350 M.Ed. thesis were selected based on specific criteria that they (a) are qualitative action research studies, (b) are undertaken by teachers who themselves teach in the science classroom, and (c) use an innovative strategy for teaching science. The meta-synthesis shows that action research contributed to developing understanding in all three domains of teacher knowledge: pedagogical knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge. The teacher researchers developed an understanding of the theory and practice of the innovative strategy implemented and found that the transformation of their science content knowledge to “fit” the new ways of teaching was the most challenging and rewarding part of their research. They also found that the balance between innovative ways of teaching science and current methods of assessment was very hard to achieve and created a barrier to the acceptance of new methods of teaching. },

  abstract={ This study explores the potential of leveraging tourist-generated images to enhance engagement and loyalty at intercity tourist sites through a photo challenge game. With over 1.72 trillion photos shared annually on social media, these visuals offer a valuable resource for motivating participation. Unlike traditional games that focus on individual attractions, our approach targets intercity destinations to foster a deeper connection and sense of loyalty. The research methodology involved meticulous preparation of diverse and relevant datasets comprising tourist-generated images. These images were categorized and classified using advanced techniques such as GAN and geometric augmentation, employing an ensemble of models including EfficientNetV2B1, EfficientNetV2B0, and MobileNetV2. Additionally, a modified Siamese network compared tourist-submitted photos with standard photos from the warehouse, displaying the ranking publicly to boost engagement. The computational analysis demonstrated outstanding performance, with a classification accuracy exceeding 97.08% and a robust scoring system accuracy of 93.10%. User feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with a high SUS score of 96.09%. By capitalizing on the vast quantity of tourist-generated images, our photo challenge game successfully enhances engagement and loyalty at intercity tourist sites. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced image processing techniques with gamification elements to create a memorable visitor experience and attract a broader audience of mature tourists. },

This paper characterizes smart and smartness in relation to describing, analyzing, and designing smart devices and systems. Examples of nominally smart devices and systems and principles that support thinking about smartness lead to a definition of smartness in the context of devices and systems. The definition leads to a classification matrix for smart capabilities organized around four categories: information processing, internal regulation, action in the world, and knowledge acquisition. Each category includes a set of separate capabilities that can be described on a continuum from not smart to somewhat smart to extremely smart based on the definition of smart. A concluding section describes how this multidimensional view of smartness can be applied in thinking about smartness while describing, analyzing, and designing devices and systems. },

This study adopted advanced methodological approaches to (i) highlight a network depicting distinct domains of human mind and behavior, and to (ii) delineate their possible direct influences. Through an Exploratory Graph Analysis on the Human Connectome Project’s database, we found a network composed by seven separate but related domains - Mental Health, Externalizing problems, High-level Cognitive Functions, Basic Cognitive Functions, Substances use/abuse, Reward Delay Discounting and Pain - unveiling a low dimensionality of human mind and behavior. Finally, by applying Bayesian Networks on this model, we observed that some facets have also specific and oriented relationships, while other facets are instead independent from each other. In such a way, we drew a potential architecture of individual’s facets that can pave the way for future neuroimaging studies and clinical practice. },

This adaptability requires large study data and intelligent decisions based on the learner’s ability. This article introduces a Definitive Teaching Support System (DTSS) exclusive to music learning to augment this concept. This system is designed to increase the adaptability of music learning based on student interest and ability. The system is powered by a fuzzy decision system for identifying maximum teaching adaptability to personalized processes. Low-to-high-sorted personalization provides new endorsements for further music sessions in the fuzzy derivative process. Maximum adaptability is the target for new personalized sessions in the universities. This differs for various students from which a common adaptability level for monotonous recommendations is identified. The identified adaptability is set as a global maximum solution towards music learning personalization. The defuzzification reduces the chances of low adaptability by expelling the stationary adaptability outcomes. },

  abstract={ The attributes and representative spirit of a culture, era, or community, as manifested in its attitude and aspiration, hold the concept of ethos. Likewise, every civilization has its own unique ethos; however, at present, it is shared through multiple globalized dynamics such as—media, technology, and other connectivities. The communication gaps have been filled with unique mediums; people are more open to new things, and comforts have increased dramatically. Nevertheless, despite such liberal and contemporary facts, we have encountered several problems and value degradation in every aspect of human life. Service and leadership, art and aesthetics, ethics and morality, politics and society, science and law, and many other realms of human endeavour have been filled with much more complexity and crisis than before. It provokes intellectuals to rethink contemporary civilization and inspires the present critical research on top. Practically surrounded by all such challenges and selecting a few of them, this paper aims to address the complexities and stepping stones in the path of leadership, holistic ethics, and human well-being from philosophical perspectives while presenting a dystopian picture of contemporary reality and continuously following the critical method. Additionally, the conclusion and uniqueness of this paper locate within the fundamental questions raised in the present composition regarding the above-selected themes and an emphasis on the renaissance of inclusive ethics and virtuous leadership. },

  abstract={ We propose an environment for assisting in the transfer of motor skills by supporting nonverbal communication with wearable haptic technology. The proposed setting comprises a human expert and several learners, all endowed with wearable devices. Learners benefit from the automated feedback obtained via wearable technology regarding a desired move relevant to a specific motor skill. Similarly, the expert benefits from automated means to provide instructions to the learner as well as from monitoring data provided by wearable devices. We focus on tactile communication as the basis for this interaction, thus supporting users who are not able to rely on other senses that are relevant to most motor skill-related tasks, such as sight and hearing. We discuss leader-follower dance as a motor skill context in order to instantiate and validate critical components of our skill transfer environment, using accelerometers and gyroscopes as the basis for sensing movements. In this particular scenario, our approach focuses on the haptic communication elements needed to perform a leader-follower dance, assessing movements by the learners in response to the intent of the expert. In order to validate our approach, we have prototyped and conducted experiments with the three critical components of our environment that enables tactile communication between experts and learners. Our development is informed by user research conducted with expert dance teachers, through which we gathered expert dance moves that resulted in a reference database that makes up one of the components that are critical to demonstrate the potential of our proposed environment. We also implemented a tactile encoder that is used to send movement instructions to learners through the sense of touch, as well as an autonomous classifier that uses the reference database as input. Overall, our results provide a roadmap for building an environment for skill transfer using nonverbal communication based on haptic wearable devices. },

  abstract={ This paper uses Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory to develop tools for analyzing interdisciplinary scientific fields. Interdisciplinary fields are scientific spaces where no single form of scientific capital has a monopoly and therefore multiple forms of scientific capital constitute the structures and stakes of scientific competition. Scientists compete to accumulate and define forms of scientific capital and also to set the rates of exchange between them. The paper illustrates this framework by applying it to the interdisciplinary field of behavior genetics. Most behavior geneticists envision their participation in the field as a means to compete for scientific capital in other fields. However, the scientific capital of behavior genetics has different values for scientists attempting to deploy it in different neighboring fields. These values depend on situations in each field and the ways behavior genetics mediates relationships among them. The pattern of relationships of exchange helps explain the social hierarchy and several features of knowledge production within behavior genetics. },

  abstract={ Academic performance (AP) is crucial for lifelong success. Unfortunately, many students fail to meet expected academic benchmarks, leading to altered career paths or university dropouts. This issue is particularly pronounced in the early stages of higher education, highlighting the need for the instructors of these foundational courses to have access to simple yet effective tools for the early identification of students at high risk of academic failure. In this study, we propose a streamlined conceptual model inspired by the Model of Human Behavior (MHB) to which we have incorporated two dimensions: capacity and willingness. These dimensions are assessed through the definition of three variables: Prior Academic Performance (PAP), Personality and Academic Engagement, whose measurements can easily be obtained by the instructors. Furthermore, we outline a Machine Learning (ML) process that higher education instructors can use to create their own tailored models in order to predict AP and identify risk groups with high levels of transparency and interpretability. The application of our approach to a sample of 322 Spanish undergraduates studying two mathematical subjects at a Spanish university demonstrates its potential to detect failure early in the semester with a precision that is comparable with that of more complex models found in literature. Our tailored model identified that capacity was the primary predictor of AP, with a gain-to-baseline improvement of 21%, and the willingness variables increasing this to 27%. This approach is consistent over time. Implications for instructors are discussed and an open prediction and analysis tool is developed. },

  abstract={ The meteoric increase in technological advancement in the last few decades has dramatically transformed how people live their lives. Innovation is seen to be essential as it ensures sustainable growth in a knowledge-based economy and a competitive global marketplace. Consequently, enabling innovation to occur becomes of prime concern to educators and policymakers. Education for the twenty-first century is about developing multiple intelligences and this demands for a holistic education system committed to enabling a learner to achieve his/her maximum potential. The learning environment in the twenty-first century needs to encompass a multiplicity of places, ideas and people that is technologically driven and often, a virtual rather than a physical space. The responsibility for creating such an environment lies in the teacher. This paper focuses on the role that teachers play in designing a powerful learning environment to drive twenty-first century learning and how teacher education must be re-designed to bring about possibilities of innovation. Possible design features of innovative teacher education programmes are outlined, including the need for a university-based teacher education programme, a strong emphasis on values and the changing role of teachers as mediators and designers of the learning environment. In order to nurture a future generation of strong thinkers, innovative problem-solvers and responsible and active local and global citizens, teachers need to consider teaching as a high calling. Finally, the paper emphasises the need for there to be strong partnerships and systemic coherence between key stakeholders of Education in order for the innovations to bring about transformation. },

However, this field has been slow to recognise the importance of emotional capacities, particularly the ones which the learners possess while learning their mother tongue and probably carry over to their L2 learning process. Drawing on the under-researched Developmental, Individual-Difference, Relationship-Based (DIR) model of language acquisition, this paper presents Emotion-Based Language Instruction (EBLI) as a new approach to bilingual education. The relevant concepts of Emotioncy, Emotionalization, and Inter-emotionality are introduced before the paper concludes by making suggestions as to how the applications of DIR to bilingual education might improve second/foreign language learning and teaching. },

  abstract={ In 2011 Pavia University celebrated its 650th birthday. This provided the opportunity to propose the Neverland project whose purpose was to overcome the division between formal and informal science education. A number of classes (various age groups) from a group of schools in the province of Pavia took part in the project. The University Museums (Physics, Medicine, Mineralogy, Natural History, Botanic Garden) and Laboratories joined forces. Each class adopted a famous Pavia scientist of the past (including Volta, Scarpa, Scopoli, Taramelli and Golgi), visited the corresponding museum and undertook specific laboratory activities. Once back at school, the information gathered was related to the history of modern figurative art focusing on the role of analogical inference, often relevant both in scientific and artistic innovation. Participatory videos and multimedia were produced. The Neverland project draws on the past work of the History of Physics Group starting in the 1980s and 1990s which aimed to preserve, restore and explain through 3D multimedia old physics instruments. This work led to the foundation of the University (Science) Museum System. Interactive exhibitions were dedicated to Volta (1999), Einstein (an international project run in 2005 in conjunction with Berlin and Jerusalem and with contributions from Oldenburg and Pisa), Galileo (2009), and the history of the energy conservation principle (2011). In all of them, high school students were trained to play the role of “explainers”, carrying out a series of historical experiments with younger pupils, classmates, and the general public. The various activities were coordinated by university students. The youngest participants were encouraged to develop forms of “artistic” expression based on the feelings and ideas experienced in their exposure to scientific activities. },

  abstract={ The educational gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians is the most significant social policy challenge facing Canada (Richards 2008). This gap is particularly evident in the science fields. Educational institutions are still regarded as mechanisms of colonization by many Aboriginal people. Their ‘foreign’ Eurocentric (or Western) culture reinforces the systematic barrier to success of Aboriginal students in the current educational system. It is time to develop a new kind of educational process, an “ecology of Indigenous education” (Cajete, Futures 42:1126-1132, 2009), to allow Aboriginal peoples to participate fully in academic science and to share their deep understandings about sustainable living. Significant advances in environmental education for all learners will follow if we can embrace the relationship with Mother Earth that allowed Aboriginal peoples to live in harmony with nature for so long before colonization. (Cajete, Futures 42:1126-1132, ) In Indigenous cultures, the development of respectful relationships among all participants must precede any effective learning. The development of this respect among all learners results from the successful incorporation of Indigenous culture into the classroom. Equal representation of knowledge from two cultural contexts is described by Mi’kmaw Elder Albert Marshall as “Two-Eyed Seeing” (Bartlett et al. in press) and (Hatcher et al. Can J Sci Math Tech Educ 9(3):141-153, 2009a). Two-Eyed Seeing is a mechanism to cross cultural borders, and has been very effective in the science classroom at many levels, as I will describe in this paper. With this guiding principle, Indigenous culture takes a place beside Western, not as an add-on to be brought out for multicultural ‘festivals’. The devastating impact of humans on Mother Earth can be seen as a result of the anthropocentric hierarchy which is evident in many Western Sciences. Mother Earth is calling for bridge-building between Western and Indigenous worldviews. This is a challenge for teachers because of the nature of Indigenous scientific knowledge. Eurocentric, or Western scientific knowledge is passed on as a package, using books, videos and multitudes of supports and props. Aboriginal, or Indigenous knowledge can be described as ‘ways of knowing’ and is acquired through a creative, participatory involvement with Mother Earth. There is an inherent trust in the learner and an intimate relationship between the learner and the ‘knowledge’, with an experienced guide to help. In this paper I will describe the basic premises behind a transition of the University science classroom to accommodate learning from two worldviews. This transition involves a move from inside to outside, both physically, spiritually and intellectually. It also involves an incorporation of ceremony, preparing the learner to listen and observe. Most importantly, a close engagement with the community and the cycles of Mother Earth must occur, reinforcing and expanding the engagement of the learner and the ‘knowledge’. },

  abstract={ This work considers a claim by a theater-dance troupe regarding a distinction in initiation points for dance and language, where the claim contrasted physicality to abstraction. The starting point here is that the troupe is expressing an awareness of a distinction they experience and, thus, that deserves ferreting out. Three interpretations of this claim within an embodied cognitive science are examined and discounted in turn. In fact, choreographers/dancers and language users alike exhibit concern with the issue of initiation of activity in that they consciously play with varying stimuli for initiation of activity to artistic effect. This is demonstrated here through a discussion of the dance film Exquisite Corps and the renga form of poetry looking at sign language instantiations. Thus, the initial theater-dance troupe’s claim cannot find purchase in an examination grounded in embodied cognitive science. If there is, in fact, a fundamental difference between the experience of initiating dancing and initiating language use it lies elsewhere, perhaps in areas of cognition yet to be explored. },

  abstract={ The current developments in second language (L2) pedagogy and the introduction of twenty-first century education compel scholars, educators, and leading education agencies in the Asia Pacific region to revisit their respective curriculum and framework for designing and preparing their English language teaching materials. However, after surveying available literature and studies in L2 pedagogy, it could be posited that there is paucity of a materials design model that would address these developments. Hence, this paper offers a sociocognitive-transformative materials design model to guide ESL and EFL teachers, material developers, and publishers in the Asia Pacific region in preparing instructional materials based on sound theories, principles, and practices. The process of model development was anchored on the grounded theory which allows a theory or model to emerge from the data. In the context of this study, the data (i.e., scholarly literature) was obtained from the top journals in applied linguistics and second language pedagogy. It is from these data that the preliminary model was developed. Using a three-pronged validation approach, findings confirmed the robustness of the model from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The findings further confirm the possibility of integrating current and relevant pedagogical concepts without contradicting one another and without contradicting other established L2 pedagogical frameworks. },

  abstract={ Enhancing the task offload performance of UAV-assisted Vehicular Edge Computing Networks (VECNs) is complex, especially in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. These networks rely on UAVs and roadside units (RSUs) to offload heavy computational tasks and reduce the load on the on-board systems. However, UAV-assisted VECNs face severe challenges from heterogeneous offload node resources and dynamic edge network environments in providing low-latency and high-response task offloading, especially during traffic congestion or infrastructure failures. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-driven task offloading framework for UAV-assisted VECNs. The aim of the proposed framework is to improve the global performance of VECN task offloading under limited computational and communication resource constraints. Firstly, we construct a decentralized offloading decision-centralized evaluation task offloading framework for UAV-assisted VECNs based on the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. Secondly, we integrate the graph attention networks (GAT) into the framework to incorporate the dynamically changing DT network topology information into the state evaluation of VECNs. By simulating a DT-driven multi-UAV cooperative system and comprehensive evaluation of real-world task request datasets. The framework has a better task throughput rate and stability when performing task offloading in local resource overload and dynamic edge environment scenarios. },

  abstract={ The main purpose of this article was to understand the current situation and challenges of the integration of mathematics and science (IMS) in Chinese primary schools. We used a questionnaire responded to by 453 primary school mathematics/science teachers and interviewed 7 teachers among them. Research showed that Chinese primary school teachers had a positive attitude toward IMS, but their beliefs about IMS were not high. Most teachers ever integrated mathematics/science in their class, but they did not have a complete understanding of the form of IMS in their minds. Results revealed that IMS in Chinese primary schools faced some challenges, such as teachers’ incomplete perceptions of IMS, lack of resources, and insufficient school support and time. Finally, we proposed some recommendations for better implementation of IMS. This research would help policymakers, curriculum developers, educators, and primary teachers in China have an overall picture of IMS. },

  abstract={ The present work aims to construct knowledge systems of different specialties, provide personalized learning approaches for students, improve the teaching effectiveness of teachers and learning interests of students, and help students accurately diagnose their learning problems. First, the existing issues of students’ chemistry learning and knowledge systems are analyzed. Then, a personalized learning model is constructed based on the distributed computing method of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the clustering algorithm of deep learning (DL). This model realizes the effective classification of students by the DL algorithm according to the students’ learning data and designs diverse customized teaching contents in line with the performance of IoT. Finally, this model’s effectiveness is verified through the data analysis of 2019 chemistry students at M University. The research results indicate that 96.67% of students express satisfaction with the learning effect of the personalized learning model, and 100% of learners are satisfied with the various forms of teaching resources offered by this model. Besides, this model’s accuracy can reach 85% on the personalized learning platform based on IoT and DL algorithms. Compared with the latest research model, this model has a better performance in achievement prediction and customized recommendation. The test results of the actual effect demonstrate that the personalized learning system has achieved expected outcomes, significantly enhancing students’ understanding of knowledge with medium difficulty. In addition, learners are delighted with the model. They believe that the learning resources in the model can meet their learning needs, and they are willing to recommend the course to other learners actively. This model is of significant practical value to promote the development of IoT and DL technology in professional learning. This exploration innovatively stratifies learners’ level of understanding and provides personalized learning resources meeting the current cognitive competence of students to enhance learners’ knowledge and achieve personalized learning. },

  abstract={ The traditional music teaching model cannot meet the needs of modern music teaching. Therefore, this paper combines machine learning technology and Internet of Things audio technology to improve the music audio recognition algorithm. In order to ensure the smoothness between music frames and the continuity of speech, when the remaining length of the music audio stream tail is less than one frame length, it is directly discarded and no framing processing is performed. The main end of the integrated platform can communicate with the sub-end systems of each smart music classroom through a standard communication protocol by the front communication server, and access the information and data of each device subsystem in the smart music classroom. In addition, this paper combines the needs of music teaching to construct the layout of the smart music classroom and the software system architecture. After constructing the system, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of the teaching system constructed in this paper. The experimental research results show that the audio technology based on the Internet of Things proposed in this paper can play an important role in music teaching. },

  abstract={ A defining characteristic of contemporary trends in global education policy is the promotion of STEM learning in the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors of education as a means to generate innovation and prosperity in the economy. Intertwined with common sensical assumptions about future labor markets and the transformative potential of technology in education, STEM has become a hegemonic discourse informing policy formation and educational practice. In Gramscian terms, the struggle over STEM as a discursive practice, between proponents of instrumental learning of marketable economic skills and those of education towards humanistic goals, reveals insights about the ideological characteristics of the push for STEM learning. This article explores the power dynamics behind the push for STEM learning as an ideological discourse propagated by global networks of elite policy actors and enacted by non-elite policy actors at the school level. The findings point toward a disjuncture between the discourse of elite policy actors in the US, the realities of STEM labor markets, and the actualization of this policy discourse into classroom practice. The implications of this study indicate that analyses of vertical power relations in network governance in STEM education should attend to the semiotics, materiality, and mutability of networked spaces. },

  abstract={ The present study aimed to investigate the role of gender in Persian verbal humor. To do so, based on an Iranian mobile app, 354 trending jokes (‘liked’ by at least 50,000 users) were selected and scrutinized to discern how male and female Persian speakers were employed in creating humor. In the light of General Theory of Verbal Humor, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data revealed that a statistically significant proportion of the online jokes were gender-biased. Furthermore, female Persian speakers were by far the main target of humor in these jokes. Further inspection also indicated that ‘marriage’, ‘reasoning ability and intelligence’, ‘beauty and make-up’, ‘general knowledge and skill’ in the female-focused humor and, ‘(feminine) beauty’, ‘heterosexual orientation’, and ‘social position’ in the male-focused humor were the major themes of ridicule. The findings suggest that Persian verbal humor serves as a true reflection of the Iranian society, mirroring post-revolutionary as well as recent socio-cultural developments. Moreover, gender roles in Persian verbal humor (and perhaps the society), are in a transitory shifting phase to the effect that traditionally masculine hegemonic concepts are giving way, albeit gradually, to emerging patterns which are more in favor of female Persian speakers. },

Through embedded case studies, including analysis of the learning arrangements and focus group interviews with the teachers involved, we found that in general the developed technology use became integrated in the teachers’ classroom practices at all schools to a similar extent. Some differences were found between the schools, but hardly any were found between the school types. Both practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. },

This study examines interviews conducted with U.S. teachers of English who taught the Oral English Training Course (OETC), a professional development course for rural Chinese teachers of English in Jiangxi province from 2007 to 2013. These teachers reveal how their own understandings and assumptions around teaching and learning shape what and how they teach, and how they evaluate the work of others. This study explains that included in the literal baggage of these foreign teachers teaching in China, is their figurative baggage, which includes their own cultural lens. The thrust of this study lies in uncovering the ideologies, assumptions, and educative constructs of foreign teachers, how these may be perceived by the Chinese teachers that they teach, and how all of this is steeped in the realities in education and the individual experiences of local actors. This study ends with recommendations for collaboration between foreign teachers of English in China, and their students, particularly Chinese teachers of English in China. },

  abstract={ This study was intended to verify the relationships among team functional competence diversity, empathy, and competence acquisition and placed more focus on team learning rather than on individual lecturing. Although functional competence diversity involved heterogeneous experts to brainstorm the development of innovative curricula, the teamwork process incurred conflicts. With the purpose of overcoming these difficulties, cultivating greater empathy in the participants helped them become more thoughtful and reduced conflicts during teamwork. We adopt purposive sampling in this study. Three hundred questionnaires were sent out, and 108 valid responses were obtained. Initially, we proved that the more participants with heterogeneous competencies there are in functional competence diversity teams, the easier it will be for them to acquire heterogeneous competencies. Second, we also found that the more teachers engage in functional competence diversity teams, the greater empathy they must have in order to reach an agreement efficiently. Third, the greater the empathy participants have, the easier it will be for them to acquire heterogeneous competencies. Finally, we verified that empathy has a mediating effect between functional competence diversity and competence acquisition in interdisciplinary teams. This study suggests that when team members have greater empathy competence, it reduces arguments, helps polish interpersonal skills, and facilitates tight cooperation that leads to the acquisition of heterogeneous knowledge and the development of systematic curricula. },

A review of the literature suggests that it is quite possible for IWB and ICT in general to further improve upon effective pedagogy. But the literature also indicates that this effectiveness is not a natural result, but is instead derived from effective training in how to utilize new resources. The study compares the ICT knowledge and skills of 30 kindergarten teachers before and after receiving relevant training. Comparing these to a control group, the study finds that the ability to implement IWBs in the classroom is greatly improved through training and that students who are instructed with these resources achieve a better grasp of scientific concepts. The study concludes with recommendations for future teacher training in other contexts. },

We aimed to better understand the significance of the IQ profile heterogeneous in HIP, with the hypothesis that some neurodevelopmental disorders could explain this. In this observational analytical study, we present data from a single case of a girl aged 6 years and 3 months old, and assessed HIP with a heterogeneous profile on the WISC-VFR. Pluridisciplinary investigations were used: neuropsychological, neuropsychomotor, neurovisual, and oculomotor assessments. The WISC-VFR scale showed a heterogeneous profile with 41 points of dissociation between high (VCI) and less scale (PSI), General Ability Index = 136. The selective auditory attention was normal, but selective visual attention was low (standard deviation = −1.15). Visual gnosis and discrimination were impaired for age. The mathematical abilities were impaired (SD = −2.25). Regarding neuromotor functions, we noted an axis tone hypotonia (−3.35 SD), with synkinesis and difficulties in dynamic balance (SD = −2.83), and in ideomotor praxis (SD = −3.02). Oculomotor recorded yielded the numerous micro-slides and micro-oscillations in fixation with a saccadic smooth pursuit. The findings showed that the HIP with a very heterogeneous IQ profile can conceal neurodevelopmental disorders with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and different learning disabilities. The main brain implications were discussed. Moreover, our original clinical approach in the neuromotor field is to use a digital standardized developmental neuropsychomotor battery and eye-tracking, allowing clinicians to avoid scoring error bias and save considerable time for important clinical data. },

About the individual behavior patterns, the authors find that human players prefer short-term periods to AI in decision-making. The interaction relationship analysis reveals a dynamic relationship between possible short-term co-movement and nearly counter-movement in the long run. The authors apply principal component analysis to descriptive indicators and discover a regular decision hierarchy. The main behavior pattern of players in the game of Go is switching between careful and daring behaviors. The differences in the decision hierarchies imply a discrepancy of patience between humans and AI. },

They have also assessed psychology to be a soft science, with much potential to be a hard science, should it allow itself to be unified by the principles offered by evolutionary psychology. With this approach, psychology would transition from its pre-paradigmatic to a paradigmatic status. In this commentary, we question their premise, method and conclusion, and finally submit that the preoccupation with paradigm is connected with a positivist view of scientific knowledge production. Psychological constructs are not ostensive in nature and cannot be treated as matter is in the hard sciences. This is neither possible, nor desirable. Additionally, such constructs are located in various theoretical perspectives, necessary to understand their multifaceted nature. We question the proposal of evolutionary psychology as an alternative meta-theory. Psychology is essentially a human endeavor, and we must step out of our need to follow the acultural Euro-American vision of positivist science, and instead build an enterprise that can be plural, contextually sensitive and incorporate the complexity and interdisciplinarity needed to be truly successful at approaching the human condition. },

The information accumulated from the students, environments, and observations increases data exchanged in the smart education platform. The challenging aspect is the data correlation and its correctness in delivering interactive educational services. Because of addressing the correctness issue, this article proposes a Flexible Observation Data Analytics Model (FODAM). The proposed model relies on the session requirement for extracting useful information. The correctness of the information is verified at the interaction level without losing any tiny observation data. In this model, regressive learning is used for the progressive identification of required data. This learning relies on session requirements and the discreteness of the observed data. The progressive training thwarts the discreteness to provide reliable and non-interrupting educational data for the interacting members. The proposed model's performance is verified using the metrics delay, efficiency, interrupts, and information rate. },

  abstract={ Before starting the process of adaptive e-learning, it is essential to define the learner’s style which reflects all the characteristics that enable the learner to learn effectively. Traditional style identification methods provide a questionnaire to extract data. This can result in a loss of learning time, and the data obtained may not be relevant as many of the answers are arbitrary. Additionally, the use of a questionnaire in a formal learning context is not effective. For this reason, an approach is proposed that combines the K-means clustering algorithm with the Felder-Silverman Learning Style model (FSLSM). This combination is based on the results of a comparative study between k-means and four learning style models: Honey-Mumford, Kolb, VARK and Felder-Silverman. The selection of these models is based on their adaptability with distance learning environments and their ability to encompass multimedia aspects. Moreover, they are regarded as a reliable pedagogical basis for numerous research projects. The implementation of k-means and FSLSM was primarily based on analyzing learners’ preferred activities and grouping them into clusters, with each cluster representing a specific combination of the FSLSM model. The proposed approach represents an integral phase within an intelligent adaptive learning model. The objective of this study is to find a solution that can cover the different learner preferences and needs to provide effective adaptive e-learning. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach, its implementation was carried out within a learning platform dedicated to the primary level. To ensure the relevance of the identified styles, an experiment was conducted using two learning scenarios: the first was adapted to the identified style, while the second was arbitrary. The results showed a high success and engagement rate in favor of the learning scenario based on the proposed approach. },

Quantitative and qualitative studies were conducted to develop a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The structural equation model analysis of students’ responses showed that IMFs were positively correlated with ASE and SEV. However, these correlations were not dependent on giftedness status.

  abstract={ This study investigated gender differences in how people estimate the intensity and style of love in themselves and in others. The six orientations toward love analyzed were: Eros (sex and passion), Ludus (game-playing), Storge (friendship and intimacy), Pragma (practical ventures), Mania (obsession and possessiveness), and Agape (altruistic love). The sample included 265 students&nbsp;(170 females and 95 males). Respondents evaluated their parents’, romantic partners’, and own overall love and the six love styles. Women endorsed self-estimates of storge, pragma and agape more than men did. Males assessed their female partners higher in mania. Gender differences in estimates of parental love styles were not found. Concerning self-partner differences, participants estimated their partners as being higher in ludic and manic love. Regarding generational differences, children well-tended to assess themselves higher in love than their fathers and mothers. Multiple regressions indicated that erotic, storgic and agapic love styles were significant predictors of overall love for self, romantic partners, and parents. Results are discussed with reference to previous research and some suggestions for further research are also noted. },

  abstract={ This study examines Finnish apprenticeship training stakeholders’ perceptions of vocational expertise and experiences of workplace learning and guidance. The semi-structured interview data was collected in 2015 in two vocational fields: the social and health care services sector (five workplaces) and the technology sector (five workplaces). The sample (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;40) consisted of apprentices (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10), their co-workers (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10), workplace trainers (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) and employers (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;10). The study applies the classifications of natural abilities and self-regulation to identify the most important individual characteristics related to vocational expertise. The socio-cultural approach to workplace learning and guidance illustrate that vocational expertise also develops from external support through participation and guidance in everyday interactions in the contexts of education and work. The data was analysed using qualitative content analysis. The findings indicate that individuals with fluent cognitive skills (e.g., problem solving skills) combined to advanced social skills, self-awareness and self-regulation are perceived as vocational experts. The apprenticeship training was considered to draw upon an extensive learning environment to facilitate an apprentice’s vocational development by offering access to authentic work tasks and collective support by experienced workers. Yet, the lack of time, resources and pedagogical approaches were found to hinder individual guidance and reciprocal workplace learning between apprentices and experienced workers. The workplaces were shown to provide fruitful learning possibilities for those apprentices with strong self-regulatory skills. },

A culturally relevant theoretical framework, Funds of Knowledge, informs the iSTEM program, a program based on the contention that the synergistic effect of a hybrid program combining two strategic approaches (1) in-school mentoring and (2) out-of-school informal science education experiences would foster engagement and interest in STEM learning. Students are paired with one of three types of mentors: Native American community members, university students, and STEM professionals. The iSTEM program is theme based with all program activities specifically relevant to Native people living in southern Arizona. Student mentees and mentors complete interactive flash STEM activities at lunch hour and attend approximately six field trips per year. Data from the iSTEM program indicate that the program has been successful in engaging Native American students in iSTEM as well as increasing their interest in STEM and their science beliefs. },

I then argue for a form of meritocracy in education for the purpose of producing talents, leaders, and frontier explorers that is different from what is often perceived as “elitist” and that is viable and important for the common good as well as for the individuals involved. I then discuss how we can negotiate and balance priorities of equity, excellence, and diversity. In light of this form of meritocracy, I suggest that the Talent Development Paradigm be adopted as a promising alternative to the Gifted Child Paradigm for the future of gifted education. },

  abstract={ Using a contrastive analysis approach, this study aimed to study emotive words (EWs) in Persian and English short stories for children. It actually tries to find the similarities and differences between the two languages in terms of using emotive words based on different types and tokens of emotions introduced by Wierzbicka (Emotions across cultures: Diversity and universality, 1999) and Devon (The origin of emotions, 2006). Additionally, it sought to investigate the impact of teaching emotive narratives on the learners’ practical knowledge of controlling emotions. To fulfill this objective, 20 short stories with similar length and level of difficulty were randomly selected, 10 in English and l0 in Persian, and 35 lines of each story were investigated to identify and classify their EWs based on the two models employed for classification. To examine the extent of similarities and differences between the frequency of EWs used in English and Persian short stories, a Chi-square test was run. The results revealed that there was not a significant difference between the two groups of stories in terms of emotion tokens; however, a significant difference was found between the frequency of EWs used in English and Persian short stories concerning different types of emotion. In the second phase of the study, emotive short stories were explicitly taught to a sample of 25 EFL learners; a DCT was utilized as the pre-test and post-test to find if learners’ practical knowledge would improve in the wake of this intervention. The findings revealed a significant improvement in the practical understanding of the participants after being exposed to the instruction of emotive narratives. The results also demonstrated that literature-based activities containing emotional cues could improve young learners’ practical knowledge required for controlling their emotions. },

With the objective of enabling students to experience practical and reflective learning, we have designed a process of interuniversity collaboration focused on horizontally developing interaction and the generation of knowledge. The deconstruction of the process, based on a narrative approach, has allowed us to open a space to reflect on the actions that encourage participation and exchange between undergraduate students from different universities and promote links with schools. The results show the transformations of the protagonists of the experience and of those who participated indirectly, redefining personal stories in the context of collaborative work and the improvement of our professional development. It also shows the implications of an interuniversity project, recounting the richness inherent in the mixture of geographical and cultural contexts involved. The dilemmas and critical incidents allow us to guide the introduction of improvements in the next cycle of collaboration. },

  abstract={ The Research Institute for Sustainability Science and Technology under the Master degree in Sustainability Science and Technology organises the course action research workshop on Science and Technology for Sustainability (5 ECTS). The authors have been coordinating the course during the academic years 13/14, 14/15 and 15/16. The purpose of the workshop is to put together civil society organisations, local administrations, students and educators to collaboratively undertake responsible research, performing transdisciplinary learning environments and by an action research framework, to answer questions such as: Who are we researching for? Who profits from our research? What are the impacts of our research? Which methodologies and tools should be used when dealing with sociotechnical sustainability challenges? Students work on real projects, related to local sustainability problems, represented by a community entity (Service learning and Campus Lab). Action research methodology is used with a two-cycle approach. In each real-life project, students, faculty and stakeholders are asked to follow the action–reflexion process of action research projects: Action 1—Jointly defining: Project purpose; Customer and interest; Involved actors; Reflexion 1—Students define: research question, initial situation, needed additional information, action Strategy, Tasks planning and distribution: Action 2—Items returning and discussing with stakeholders, Reflexion 2—Revising and reformulating. Having now run the workshop three times, we can conclude that: first, students realised the significance of framing an investigation under a research methodological framework that allows bringing research to the community, enhancing transdisciplinarity in any initiative or action in sustainability science. They set out the importance of some topics and the difficulty to hold them. Second, the formulation of the problem became one of the most arduous tasks in the process; difficulties were mainly related to the perception of the problem from distinct community group motivations. Third, interaction and communication with stakeholders and the recognition of their role was problematic as engineering students are not usually trained to work in wicked problems nor accompany stakeholders during the whole process. Finally, it is relevant to highlight that during the process students faced conflict and frustrating situations both within their team and with stakeholders. To help tackle this problem, an Emotional Intelligence module was introduced in the workshop which proved useful in helping students to solve some paralysing situations, which could otherwise have stopped the progress of the project. We suggest that engineering students need specific training in transdisciplinary research and in conflict resolution, to avoid collapsing in frustration when dealing with real transdisciplinary sustainability transitions. },

It comprises information on student’s characteristics such as background knowledge, learning style preference, goals, personality etc. The foremost challenge that the students experience in learning system is that they are unable to bring back relevant information based on their needs. One of the methods used to obtain the students’ needs is to create a highly efficient student profile, which would represent the true students’ needs. Our contribution consists in modeling a student’s profile based on many important characteristics. In this context, we developed an “SPOnto” ontology to represent a student profile in an adaptive gamified learning system. This ontology will then help the classification of the different types of learners using the machine learning techniques. The present paper epitomizes the implementation of our contribution in a gamified learning environment “Class Quiz” and the assessment of its effectiveness. We created classification models by applying several algorithms and using a dataset encompassing 500 instances. },

Alphabet knowledge is an important fundamental literacy skill which has been found to directly impact the future academic success of students. Game-based learning and the use of multimodal engagement activities have been found to be effective intervention strategies in successful alphabet training programmes. In this study, a Kinect based digital Catcher Game was developed for English alphabet training of primary school students. For a duration of 4 weeks, a control group (CG) consisting of 41 Class-III students received traditional classroom training for 60&nbsp;min each day. During the same period, an intervention group (IG) consisting of 45 Class-III students was trained for 30&nbsp;min in the traditional class and using a Catcher Game session for another 30&nbsp;min. The alphabet knowledge performances of the two groups were compared before and after the game-based training intervention. During the pre-test, no statistically significant differences were observed in the alphabet knowledge performance of the CG and IG. In the post-intervention evaluation, the IG students were found to perform significantly better in the test than the CG. During their post-intervention feedback, most of the IG students and teachers talked favorably about the use of Catcher Game intervention and attributed the significant improvement in IG performance to this intervention. Post-intervention, the teachers also reported a significant improvement in the motivation and engagement among the IG students during regular classroom sessions. },

Has Epstein’s case for simple rules become obsolete with the arrival of artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning (ML)? Can ML deliver better algorithmic rules than traditional simple legal rules? This paper argues that the answer to these question is “no” by building an argument based on three increasingly more serious barriers that ML faces to develop legal (or quasi-legal) algorithmic rules: data availability, the Lucas’ critique, and incentive compatibility in eliciting information. Thus, the case for simple legal rules is still sound even in a world with ML. },

The sample consisted of 24 science teachers recruited using criterion sampling, which is a purposive sampling method. A case study, which is a qualitative research method, was the design of choice. Data were collected through interviews, videotapes, and expert observations. The data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Themes, categories, and codes were developed in accordance with the research purpose. Participants had positive opinions about the LSM, STEM education, and distance learning. Participants stated that the LSM activities within distance learning contributed to pedagogy and content knowledge in the STEM education process. The challenges faced by participants were unfavorable environmental conditions, time management issues, and a lack of knowledge and experience in lesson planning. Expert observations and videotapes corroborate these results, indicating that the LSM integrated with STEM education results in higher quality STEM lesson planning and teaching. Moreover, distance learning platforms are promising ways to ensure the professional development of teachers during the pandemic. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this review article is to present state-of-the-art approaches and examples of virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems, applications and experiences which improve student learning and the generalization of skills to the real world. Thus, we provide a brief, representative and non-exhaustive review of the current research studies, in order to examine the effects, as well as the impact of VR/AR technologies on K-12, higher and tertiary education students’ twenty-first century skills and their overall learning. According to the literature, there are promising results indicating that VR/AR environments improve learning outcomes and present numerous advantages of investing time and financial resources in K-12, higher and tertiary educational settings. Technological tools such as VR/AR improve digital-age literacy, creative thinking, communication, collaboration and problem solving ability, which constitute the so-called twenty-first century skills, necessary to transform information rather than just receive it. VR/AR enhances traditional curricula in order to enable diverse learning needs of students. Research and development relative to VR/AR technology is focused on a whole ecosystem around smart phones, including applications and educational content, games and social networks, creating immersive three-dimensional spatial experiences addressing new ways of human–computer interaction. Raising the level of engagement, promoting self-learning, enabling multi-sensory learning, enhancing spatial ability, confidence and enjoyment, promoting student-centered technology, combination of virtual and real objects in a real setting and decreasing cognitive load are some of the pedagogical advantages discussed. Additionally, implications of a growing VR/AR industry investment in educational sector are provided. It can be concluded that despite the fact that there are various barriers and challenges in front of the adoption of virtual reality on educational practices, VR/AR applications provide an effective tool to enhance learning and memory, as they provide immersed multimodal environments enriched by multiple sensory features. },

The key hypothesis is that the staple strategy of agency decision-making during the last decade has been ‘hypervigilance’; defined here as: a state in which agency policy is rationally structured to maximize the pursuit of false positives and gravitate aggressively toward security threats. The related research question is ‘How can we study hypervigilance and false positives in all matters regarding policing terror threats?’ We argue that increased security measures tend to err toward pursuing false positives. However, we do not claim to understand the overall economic costs and benefits of recent homeland security policy decisions, in tangible financial or other realms. We contend that such an understanding is presently unattainable, considering the lack of raw data availability of how many terrorist attacks have been halted by increased security measures within the last decade. We do argue however, that the signal detection model is an appropriate starting methodology for study of such policing strategies. },

A narrative phenomenological approach has been adopted to enable the participant researchers to socially co-construct an analysis of their experiences working with the Australian Curriculum: The Arts including challenges, implications and the future for their respective discipline areas and the Arts overall. The three key themes from these collective voices revealed a quality arts education is an entitlement for every child and young person; the Arts provide important opportunities for children and young people from diverse backgrounds and cultures to demonstrate their learning, express themselves and participate; and arts educators and the Arts industry need to work together to strengthen community understanding about the value of the Arts in education. This process provided important insights into how exposure and engagement with the Arts shape the ways in which children and young people make meaning in their lives, enhance their overall wellbeing, increase their sense of social responsibility and contribute to a socially-just society. },

  abstract={ Architectural design pedagogy is indeed complex. At the early stages, basic design principles should be addressed and the design process should be taught with its multidisciplinary variables to enable each student to develop an individual approach. In this regard, the objective of this study is to propose strategies for enhancing students’ learning and production abilities within the context of architectural education. The present study also considers the interactions and learning processes of students in design studios. The study has yielded hypotheses that underscore the necessity for the incorporation of novel and dynamic learning elements to facilitate and reinforce this process, alongside the significance of interactions between all these elements. In this context, the educational processes and components of architectural design studios were initially examined, and processes and components supporting student development were subsequently identified. In order to provide support for the identified hypotheses, a pentagon model was created and relationship network diagrams and DEMATEL analyses were conducted. Furthermore, the model was evaluated through a case study conducted with first-year students enrolled in the architectural design course during the fall term of 2022–2023 at the Department of Architecture of Bingöl University. A significant outcome of this study is the provision of a guide for researchers and studio instructors in architectural education, which details the progression of design studios. Testing the proposed model in various studios and educational settings will contribute to the development of the identified hypotheses and the created model. },

Each of these approaches has developed globally, with a rich history of supporting children’s educational freedom. This narrative analysis provides a means for early childhood educators and scholars to understand the aims, philosophical and theoretical frameworks, historical development, benefits, and challenges in these models and their methods of practice. As early childhood education evolves with technology and as re-conceptualizations about early education occur, an understanding of these alternatives to traditional education models is important. While adaptive options of these models may emerge in education systems across national contexts, this review allows educators to consider their applications and cultural appropriateness in specific local and community contexts. },

  abstract={ Meditative practices have a long history in India and have influenced contemporary meditative programs elsewhere in the world. Over the last several decades, the use of meditation as a therapeutic tool has been investigated in regard to physical, emotional and behavioral effects with impressive results. In parallel to this has been a growing interest in research on spirituality, spiritual growth, and therapeutic modalities that incorporate the spiritual dimension of the person. Ironically, very little research has explored the interface between these two constructs, despite how closely linked they are traditionally. This paper addresses the range of ways in which spirituality and spiritual development might be fruitfully investigated in the context of meditative practice, bringing further understanding to both psychological constructs. Furthermore, the widely recognized significance of both meditative and spiritual experiences suggests that cross-cultural research may be particularly valuable at identifying factors that engage the universal human capacity of spirituality, and the particular potential for meditative practice in doing so. },

The participants were 388 high school students in Turkey. Data collection tools were a ML self-efficacy beliefs scale and a learning styles inventory. The data were analysed using χ2 test, one-way analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis. The analyses indicated that students were mostly diverger learners and had a moderate level of ML self-efficacy belief, and that their levels of ML self-efficacy beliefs did not significantly differ in terms of their learning styles. The results revealed that ML self-efficacy beliefs scores differed in terms of learning styles and that converger learners had higher levels of self-efficacy beliefs. Moreover, the factors ‘reflective observation’ and ‘perceiving knowledge’ were found to be significant predictors of the ML self-efficacy belief. The negative effects of the learning style on learners’ ML self-efficacy belief should be prevented. Undesirable differences between learners’ ML beliefs can be avoided by letting mathematics teachers design and administer the learning processes according to their students’ learning styles. },

This paper argues that virtue epistemology encounters challenges reminiscent of those recently encountered by virtue ethics: just as seemingly trivial variation in context provokes unsettling variation in patterns of moral behavior, trivial variation in context elicits unsettling variation in patterns of cognitive functioning. Insofar as reliability is a condition on epistemic virtue, we have reason to doubt that human beings possess the cognitive materials required for epistemic virtue, and thereby reason to think that virtue epistemology is threatened by skepticism. We conclude that while virtue epistemology has resources for addressing this challenge, exploiting these resources forces tradeoffs between empirical and normative adequacy. },

  abstract={ This paper explores some theoretical reflections on the connection between C. S. Lewis’s thoughts on the purpose and process of education and his understanding of supernatural human nature which has been relatively little explored. An introduction about Lewis’s career as a college teacher blends into the background of this paper. It is followed by Lewis’ argument on the purpose of education which is: To produce a “good man” (“human”) who pursues knowledge for the sake of learning and makes the right emotional and behavioural responses, affirming truly objective and universal values (Tao). Intertwined with this argument is the dual reality of the human condition straddling this world and the other one with the latter taking precedence over the former. In order to produce educated men and women, Lewis argues for making the most of literary experiences and liberal studies as a main avenue toward the transformation of the inner self of each student. These literary experiences need to be combined with a healthy dose of the right action and behaviour because deliberate action with a purpose can create a reality in our character through the process of gaining momentum as a real interest or attitude in that direction takes hold. Lastly, some of the implications of these reflections for those who work with the young in schools and in liberal education are drawn out. },

An attempt was also made to understand whether tacit knowledge plays a mediating role on the relationship between online communities and innovation performance. This study applied questionnaire survey, and 163 enterprises in Taiwan served as the sample. Analyses were conducted by confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling. It was found that online communities of the enterprises had significant positive effect on the acquisition of tacit knowledge. Also, tacit knowledge had a significant positive effect on the innovation performance of enterprises. Tacit knowledge had a mediating effect on the relationship between online communities and innovation performance. This study not only proved that communication between online community members promote the acquisition of tacit knowledge, but also tested the mediating effect of tacit knowledge. Therefore, enterprises could be aware of the importance of tacit knowledge (share and apply from operating online communities) to innovation performance. Moreover, enterprises that attach importance to the interaction between online community members and the sharing of tacit knowledge were implicated in this study. },

  abstract={ We define humility as the ability to realistically assess one’s limitations and strengths. Unlike other moral virtues, humility has been found distinctively difficult to acquire. Our paper makes two significant contributions. Although the role and importance of humility have been clearly established in the literature, our paper is the first to empirically test a theoretically-posited inter-relationship between humility and the moral virtues. Our paper empirically tests this relationship, specifically between humility and the social virtues with the personal virtues acting as a mediator. The second contribution of our paper is to present the design and delivery of a humility-embedded pedagogical teaching and learning approach using a professional ethics course. Essentially, we are suggesting a methodology that make ethics education more effective. We follow Sims and Felton (Journal of Business Ethics 63 (3): 297–312, 2006) analytical framework that incorporates targeted learning outcomes, environment, processes, and experience facilitated through a student-led pedagogical approach. We utilize the concept of “critical consciousness”, developed by Jagger and Volkman (The International Journal of Management Education 12 (2): 177–185, 2013), which is captured through the mechanisms of a Student Learning Portfolio and a Process-Oriented-Guided-Enquiry approach. Both these mechanisms incorporate critical self-reflection and the application of knowledge derived from experience. Our findings have significant implications for the effective teaching of ethics, and more generally for business and management education. },

Firstly, environmental modelling is conducted. Then, the principles of the two algorithms and their roles in path planning are addressed. The monotonic heating simulated annealing algorithm solves the problem of the traversal order of each part in the area, and it uses the ant colony algorithm to connect them. Simulation results show that the path coverage rate is 100% and the repetition rate is 4.85%. It can completely cover the whole area and has a low repetition rate, which greatly improves the efficiency of the cleaning robot. },

Tasks were analysed for several dimensions with a particular focus on their level of cognitive demands (LCD). Tasks were distinguished in two groups in terms of LCD: lower-level demand and higher-level demand. The findings revealed that 75&nbsp;% of the tasks were related to higher-level demand in that they requested a certain level of interpretation, required connecting knowledge and procedures related to each other, demanded responses with some explanation and reinforced students’ non-algorithmic thinking. Only 25&nbsp;% of the tasks were related to a lower-level demand, and these tasks could be resolved by recalling and implementing rules, procedures and factual knowledge without reflecting upon the meaning behind them. Most of the tasks were presented in multiple representations and framed in non-mathematical contexts. All these task characteristics indicate that the new elementary school textbooks have the capacity to promote students’ proportional reasoning. The findings also inform the international community about crucial aspects of the curriculum reforms in Turkey and provide suggestions for teachers and textbook writers concerning the quality of the tasks and their selection and implementation in the classrooms. },

Planning, centralized policy making, top-down implementation, and administrative control had been the standards of the first few decades of Korean education. The so-called May 31 education reform implemented in 1995 made a turning point for these approaches to education policy and administration by highlighting autonomy, openness, diversity, accountability, consumer centeredness, market control, and governance for quality education. However, these government-driven education reform initiatives have resulted in limiting the expected outcomes. In this paper, the authors call for a new approach to education policy and administration and propose supporting school innovation, empowering an internal accountability system in governance. The authors also suggest a search for normative values for democratic communitarianism as a new philosophical foundation of education policy framework, beyond instrumental values of education. },

  abstract={ Skin cancer is one of the top three hazardous cancer types, and it is caused by the abnormal proliferation of tumor cells. Diagnosing skin cancer accurately and early is crucial for saving patients’ lives. However, it is a challenging task due to various significant issues, including lesion variations in texture, shape, color, and size; artifacts (hairs); uneven lesion boundaries; and poor contrast. To solve these issues, this research proposes a novel Convolutional Swin Transformer (CSwinformer) method for segmenting and classifying skin lesions accurately. The framework involves phases such as data preprocessing, segmentation, and classification. In the first phase, Gaussian filtering, Z-score normalization, and augmentation processes are executed to remove unnecessary noise, re-organize the data, and increase data diversity. In the phase of segmentation, we design a new model “Swinformer-Net” integrating Swin Transformer and U-Net frameworks, to accurately define a region of interest. At the final phase of classification, the segmented outcome is input into the newly proposed module “Multi-Scale Dilated Convolutional Neural Network meets Transformer (MD-CNNFormer),” where the data samples are classified into respective classes. We use four benchmark datasets—HAM10000, ISBI 2016, PH2, and Skin Cancer ISIC for evaluation. The results demonstrated the designed framework’s better efficiency against the traditional approaches. The proposed method provided classification accuracy of 98.72%, pixel accuracy of 98.06%, and dice coefficient of 97.67%, respectively. The proposed method offered a promising solution in skin lesion segmentation and classification, supporting clinicians to accurately diagnose skin cancer. },

As a result, it identified facilitating and conflicting factors in practicing DI and analyzing the activity system in teaching for DI. From this analysis, specific user requirements were identified as blueprints for the design of new tools as mediating strategies. Furthermore, the findings helped establish five design guidelines for teacher tools to encourage DI practice. This study has implications for a teacher application as a mediating tool, which will facilitate DI practice by developing an understanding of teachers’ needs and the challenges they face in DI activities.

Although the results have shown that the proposed online training of university teachers may be effective in improving their competencies and motivation in the inclusion of students with disabilities, they still need some improvement -according to the suggestions made by the teachers participating in the study-. Most of these suggestions made by high-level teachers especially recommended the ones related to conceptual clarification, presentation of case studies or examples, and description of actions in the didactic field. },

  abstract={ This descriptive study attempted to explore teaching styles by eliciting beliefs of a group of English language teachers through Peacock’s (Int J Appl Linguist 11:1–20, 2001) Perceptual Teaching Style Preference Questionnaire and interviews based on Reid’s hypotheses (TESOL Q 21:87–111, 1987; Learning styles in the ESL/EFL classroom. Boston: Heinle &amp; Heinle, 1995) on learning styles and Doyle and Rutherford’s (Theory Pract 23:20–25, 1984) suggestions on matched instructional designs. The mixed methods research design was adopted in the current study, and concurrent triangulation was used to corroborate the findings. Study findings indicated that the participants reportedly applied the group teaching style more frequently than the other styles and favored a repertoire of the visual and auditory perceptual teaching styles. Although participants were mostly positive about the importance of learning styles, effects of perceptual teaching styles on learning, and the matched instructional design, they did not believe that their students were aware of their own learning styles and noted various curricular and administrative constraints in relation to implementation of the matched instruction. Consequently, the current study suggested that the language teachers and their line managers should consider effective planning and implementation of the entire teaching operation in relation to the matched instructional design in their classrooms. Also, it is recommended that as part of their professional development, the classroom practitioners are encouraged to explore their students’ “voices” and raise their learners’ awareness regarding their learning styles for more effective teaching–learning processes. },

  abstract={ Creativity is widely recognized as a crucial factor for both personal and social advancement. Given that the early years lay the foundation for future learning and development, fostering creativity during this period is of paramount importance. To facilitate and optimize creativity in the classroom, it is essential to understand teachers’ conceptualization of creativity and their instructional approaches. This paper reviewed 20 empirical studies conducted in various cultural contexts over the past decade, focusing on early childhood educators’ perceptions and beliefs about creativity and teaching practices for promoting creativity. The findings indicated that teachers generally have a shared understanding of the definition of creativity and recognize the importance of nurturing creativity in young children. However, several obstacles hinder their efforts to foster creativity in the classroom, including insufficient support from administrators and parents, as well as a lack of training and preparation for creative teaching practices. },

  abstract={ Globally, data security and privacy over the Internet of Things (IoT) are necessary due to its emergence in daily life. As the IoT will soon invade each part of our lives, attention to IoT security is significant. The nature of attacks is dynamic, and addressing this requires designing dynamic methods and a self-adaptable scheme to discover security attacks from malicious use of IoT equipment. The best detection mechanism against attacks from compromised IoT devices includes machine learning techniques. This study emphasizes the latest literature on attack types and uses a scheme based on machine learning&nbsp;for network support in IoT and intrusion detection. Therefore, the current work includes a thorough analysis of multiple intelligence methods and their deployed architectures of network intrusion detection, focusing on IoT attacks and machine learning-based intrusion detection schemes. Moreover, it explores methods based on machine learning appropriate for identifying IoT devices associated with cyber attacks. },

However, whether this can cause behavior change or elevation of leadership effectiveness remains uncertain and must be tracked and verified. The current study continues previous research and has the following purposes: (1) to investigate the status quo of vocational high school principals’ leadership effectiveness and the differences before and after implementing 360 degree evaluation feedback, (2) to analyze the relationship between principals’ leadership behavior change intentions and their leadership effectiveness, and (3) to explore principals’ opinions regarding use of the 360 degree evaluation as a motive for leadership behavior change and their perceptions of the influence on leadership effectiveness. To achieve purposes (1) and (2), this study examines the 69 schools in the pilot study and uses a sample of 40 schools and 1030 people for the questionnaire survey. The interview survey is conducted on 12 principals of the 40 schools for research purpose. (3) This study gains significant findings: (1) Vocational high school principals emphasize rational goal leadership effectiveness. (2) Implementation of 360 degree evaluation benefits principals in improving leadership effectiveness. (3) Principals with high behavior change intentions have better leadership effectiveness. (4) Principals mostly possess positive and supportive attitudes toward using 360 degree evaluation feedback as an important source of leadership behavior change, and they have positive perceptions of its influence. },

From a total of 1419 student data within 33 primary studies, we found an overall effect size of 0.78 (Hedges’ g), which indicates a strong effect size of intervention efforts on peer relations of students with disabilities. With respect to outcomes, we found higher effect sizes (g = 0.82) particularly on collaboration than self-directedness (g = 0.47). We also found that instructions were highly effective for both students with (g = 0.93) and without disabilities (g = 0.76). It would be encouraged for educators to put consistent effort into implementing instructions that target to improve peer relationships and consider instruction variables such as length of program while balancing the quantitative and qualitative aspects of peer relationship. },

  abstract={ Education in the STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—has become essential to learning in the twenty-first century, particularly in rural places where resources for education are sometimes scarce. The present state of STEM education in rural regions is examined in this systematic study, with an emphasis on the use of STEM interventions and technology. The goals are to close the knowledge gap in rural STEM interventions and to provide research directions to improve STEM education in rural areas. This systematic review examined 64 articles in rural STEM education published between July 2013 and June 2023. The findings revealed that while STEM toolkits have proven effective in enhancing student engagement and academic performance in non-Asian contexts with most studies conducted in North America, there is a significant lack of understanding of their implementation and impact in Asian rural communities. Future research should focus on creating STEM interventions that are resource-conscious and culturally sensitive as well as expanding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in rural STEM education. Comprehensive teacher training programs are needed to give educators the tools they need to successfully implement STEM education. Rural STEM education could empower students to actively participate in the global economy and foster positive community impacts. },

  abstract={ The multi-area micro-grid system (MAMG) is a complex nonlinear system. Instability or performance degradation may cause due to inadequate damping under the sudden load fluctuation in the system. Owing to this, to provide uninterrupted electric power with additional attributes, strong and intelligent control methods are curiously necessary for automatic generation control of micro-grid (MG). The utilization of ennoble class topper optimization (E-CTO) tuned fuzzy cascaded proportional-integral proportional-derivative (fuzzy PI-PD), i.e., fuzzy PI-PD controller in frequency control in two areas interconnected MG (isolation mode) with renewable penetration is a novel work. A maiden attempt of the E-CTO is intended to optimize the range of the membership function of the fuzzy controller by employing the integral time absolute error (ITAE) criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is exposed by opposing the dynamic answers of MAMG with a fuzzy PI-PD and traditional controller. In the end, a sensitivity study is offered to show the power of the planned approach to wide fluctuations in the MG parameters, magnitude likewise the situation of step/ random load disturbance. The recommended MAMG and optimization techniques are simulated in the LabVIEW@2015 environment. Also, OPAL-RT based real-time analysis is presented to full-prof the novel work. },

PTs have been applied in diverse areas, such as eCommerce, health, workplace, vehicles, urban and ambient environments. A kind of PT that has become popular in eLearning is known under the name “Gamification” – introducing game mechanics (such as points, levels, badges, leaderboards) into non-game environments. We implemented three persuasive strategies in an online learning environment supporting a University class to encourage more active engagement of students in their online learning activities. The paper presents a controlled study that shows a positive effect of the persuasive intervention on student engagement, measured by the increase in their online activities. The study results also show that personalizing the persuasive strategies to the receptiveness of individual students amplifies their effect on engagement. },

  abstract={ In October 2013, CNN reported that 400 civilians had been killed in Pakistan by unmanned aircraft (UA) (Unmanned aircraft are sometimes referred to in this article as drones) since President Obama took office in 2009. Transnational legal theory suggests that such attacks are illegal and, in 2009, the United Nations special rapporteur on extra judicial killings suggested that the use of drones by the Obama administration in Afghanistan and Pakistan was untenable and contrary to international law. The underlying concerns with regard to legal issues are state sovereignty, responsibility, and liability. One of the contentious issues would be whether unmanned aircraft flying outside their permitted areas violate state sovereignty, and if so—what can be done to prevent future UA violations of sovereignty of the airspace. Another would be, as earlier mentioned, whether the killings carried out by drones amount to extra judicial killings. The focus of this article is on legal challenges and whether military functions of UA can be brought under international regulation. Despite the inherent advantages of this relatively new mode of aviation—such as camouflage, low cost, and the avoidance of risk to the pilot on board in UA operations—serious concerns abound, which go to the heart of the law of humanity. This article addresses these concerns from a legal perspective. },

Integrating physical activity in mathematics lessons may lead to improvements in students’ physical activity levels as well as enjoyment, engagement and learning. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a curriculum-based physical activity integration program known as EASY Minds (Encouraging Activity to Stimulate Young Minds) on children’s daily school time physical activity levels. Secondary aims include exploring the impact of EASY Minds on their engagement and ‘on task’ behaviour in mathematics. Grade 5/6 classes from eight public schools in New South Wales, Australia will be randomly allocated to intervention (n = 4) or control (n = 4) groups. Teachers from the intervention group will receive one day of professional development, a resource pack and asked to adapt their lessons to embed movement-based learning in their daily mathematics program in at least three lessons per week over a six week period. Intervention support will be provided via a weekly email and three lesson observations. The primary outcomes will be children’s physical activity levels (accelerometry) across both the school day and during mathematics lessons (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary time). Children’s ‘on-task’ behaviour, enjoyment of mathematics and mathematics attainment will be assessed as secondary outcomes. A detailed process evaluation will be undertaken. EASY Minds is an innovative intervention that has the potential to improve key physical and academic outcomes for primary school aged children and help guide policy and practice regarding the teaching of mathematics.

LA ethics is an interdisciplinary field of study that addresses moral, legal, and social issues; therefore, institutions are responsible for implementing frameworks that integrate these topics. Many of the ethical issues raised apply equally to educational data sets of any size. However, in this study, we focus on big data that increases the scale and granularity of data gathered. The purpose of this study is twofold: (a) to critically review the published (2011–2018) scientific literature on LA ethics issues and (b) to identify current trends and answer research questions in the field. This study’s research questions are as follows: what is essential in LA ethics for key educational stakeholders, and what should a proposed checklist for LA ethics include for specific educational stakeholders? After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, journals, and conferences, a literature review identified 53 articles from a sample of 562. The selected articles, based on critical and qualitative content analysis, were exhaustively analysed. The findings demonstrate the shortage of empirical evidence-based guidelines on LA ethics and highlight the need to establish codes of practices to monitor and evaluate LA ethics policies. Finally, this work proposes a useful checklist as an instructional design model for scholars, policymakers, and instructional designers, so that trusted partners may use LA responsibly to improve teaching and learning. },

  abstract={ There is a growing body of empirical evidence documenting the positive effects associated with participation in environmental education and outdoor learning for students, teachers and the wider community. Despite this, there has been a substantial reduction in outdoor learning opportunities for school students, possibly due to the focus on evidenced-based outcomes, high-stakes standardised testing programs, and a lack of teacher knowledge, confidence and expertise in teaching and learning outdoors. Accordingly, this study presents an evidenced based model to support teaching practice. The model will assist teachers in the development and implementation of outdoor learning opportunities and offers applied examples that address curriculum outcomes. A comprehensive literature review methodology was implemented to identify peer-reviewed literature on teaching and learning outdoors and outdoor pedagogies. A thematic synthesis and constant comparative technique enabled development of themes, from which three themes emerged: the environment; the learner; and the educator, which inform the proposed model offered by the authors. The three interrelated components (the environment, the learner and the educator) require consideration for students to gain maximum benefit from outdoor learning experiences. The model, coupled with the applied examples, supports teachers to plan and facilitate immersive outdoor experiences that promote learning. },

  abstract={ In an online teaching system, the massive increment of offline storage data, teaching videos, and other data can not fit the requirements of personalized resource recommendation under large-scale user access. Therefore, a reliable recommendation system of personalized resources for online teaching systems under large-scale user access is designed. The system architecture and function modules, as well as the reliability recommendation process design are introduced in detail. By distributing and processing large-scale access data, the system's recommendation efficiency can be effectively improved. The establishment of unit closures based on the internal structure of subject knowledge allows for more effective learning of related knowledge. By introducing a time interest factor and using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to analyze students' interest distribution and calculate the interest weight of each topic and similarity of each topic, a topic interest model based on the time dimension is established, providing better support for personalized development of students. Collaborative filtering and association rules of unit closure are combined and recommended to realize the reliability recommendation of personalized resources. The experiment results show that the average coverage, average P@n measure and AUC measures reach 98.5%, 97.5% and 0.95 respectively, and the recommended time is 5.6&nbsp;ms. It is proved that the proposed system has a strong ability to explore non-target keywords, which effectively improves the recommendation efficiency and reliability. },

The device not only helped the student focus attention, it facilitated his becoming much more metacognitive in his reading. Comparisons of pre- and post-assessments showed that the student had gained one year’s growth in reading within a sixweeks time period. The student also gained in confidence and sense of being in control of his learning. While generalizations to other struggling readers with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder cannot be made, the success this student experienced suggests that the use of this device is worth serious consideration and research in similar contexts. },

  abstract={ An online authentic learning environment (OnALE) is proposed in this study to facilitate students’ learning of inferential statistics in a real-life context. The efficacy of the OnALE, in comparison to the conventional approach relative to the students’ performance, was explored. Respondents from the experimental group were purposively selected to complete the Perception Questionnaire regarding the features of the OnALE. The Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) on the post-test scores using prior knowledge scores as covariate disclosed a significant variance in the post-test scores between control and experimental groups (F (1, 74) = 10.924, p &lt; 0.05, partial η2 = 0.129), with the experimental group displaying a higher mean score. Outcomes from the Perception Questionnaire revealed that all respondents at least agreed that each authentic learning characteristic in the OnALE facilitated their learning. The highest and the lowest rated characteristics were Collaboration and Multiple Roles and Perspectives, respectively. The framework of the OnALE characteristics for varying levels of students’ performance unveiled the combinations of authentic learning characteristics beneficial to students from different performing groups. This framework functions as a guideline for statistics educators and learning designers to provide an effective online learning environment. },

Content analysis was utilized to explore the differentiation strategies included and student characteristics considered in PST plans and how PSTs used differentiation strategies and student characteristics to differentiate lesson content, process, product, and environment. In addition, a rubric was designed and utilized to analyze the level of detail PSTs provided in their plans. Results indicated that overall, PSTs were developing in their planning for differentiation of instruction, using general terms to describe the modifications they would make to meet student needs. Moreover, results revealed that PSTs included strategies to differentiate lesson content and environment most often in their plans and frequently considered student readiness levels when planning for differentiation. Findings also revealed that PSTs need support in learning how to plan for differentiation based on student cultural backgrounds. Implications for mathematics teacher preparation are discussed. },

  abstract={ ICT tools have gained particular importance in the English as a foreign language classroom in order to promote students’ interaction, exchange of opinions, negotiation of meaning, or digital competence. Technological development and the impact of multimedia and virtual spaces on students’ lives make educational institutions and teachers explore new tools and strategies to learn the target language. Podcasts present content available on the Internet and can become an influential teaching strategy that may improve the teaching–learning process of EFL. This study aims to investigate the effect of audio podcasts, which deal with social inequality issues, on secondary education students’ EFL linguistic competence. A sample of seventy-eight students was randomly distributed into a control and an experimental group during a term in a high school in Madrid (Spain). As instruments for data collection, the grades obtained in the different skills in the pre and post-tests and the different task performance scores were analysed in both groups. The methodological framework is defined as a quasi-experimental design that provides quantitative data. The results confirm the hypothesis that the creation and use of podcasts are beneficial for improving EFL linguistic competence, especially speaking and listening skills. Practical implications aimed at organising English classes to improve EFL proficiency are discussed. },

Researchers agree that there is a historical overreliance on IQ in determining service eligibility; however, no brief parent rating scale appears in the empirical literature to support the decision-making of school evaluation teams. Items of the Characteristics of Giftedness Scale (Silverman 1993) were selected and expanded upon to create a brief 20-item instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that the modified scale was best characterized as having a two-factor structure. Furthermore, group differences were found between students eligible for gifted school programming and those without gifted status at school. Taken together, present findings suggest that this modified scale may be a suitable evaluation tool for school-based use. },

In this paper, we describe the activities associated with the development and design of the program and the curriculum. We provide expert-ratings of the STEAM and social emotional elements of the program and present instructor and participant feedback about the program’s content and its delivery. Our results revealed that infusing the arts and social emotional learning content into science education created a holistic STEM-related curriculum that holds potential for enhancing young children’s interest in and appreciation for science and its applications. The data also suggested that the program was well-developed and, generally well-executed. However, experts rated the STEAM elements of the program more positively than the SEL elements, especially with regard to sequencing of lessons and integration among the lessons and hands-on activities, indicating that program revisions are warranted. },

  abstract={ Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a major learning objective in the initial vocational training of carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the level and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. In this study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Carpenter apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected given their general school level. In particular, their spatial skills were found to be similar to those of high school students and superior to those of apprentices of another profession. Carpenters’ spatial skills improve over the course of their apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to the training that they receive during their apprenticeship. Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to develop further solutions that encourage further improvement of teaching and learning activities for spatial skills. },

It is no longer good enough to work on these challenges discreetly, or solely within the dominant, western colonial paradigm and practices of governance. There are ongoing harms being caused by climate work that does not embed justice, and there are missed opportunities for synergies across these domains as they have the same systemic root causes. Cities must adapt and transform the processes and practices of planning and policy-making in order to work at these problematic roots. Drawing on an empirical study, this article describes how social innovation, systemic design, and decolonizing practices can shape a different approach to planning and policy-making processes when working at the intersections of climate, equity, and decolonization. },

  abstract={ Situated learning suggests that knowledge is grounded in and influenced by the learning context, the activity, and the culture. Thus, learning in such situated learning contexts can improve learners’ learning performance. Based on embodied cognition and situated learning, this study proposes a situated embodiment-based strategy to help learners learn flag semaphore through real signaling practices with their body movements in a richly perceived learning context. With the support of natural user interface technologies and educational robots, the situated embodiment-based strategy provides a realistic learning context via learners’ body movements to help learners easily construct procedural knowledge. In order to evaluate the effects of the situated embodiment-based strategy, a flag semaphore learning activity was designed and a quasi-experiment was conducted with 60 participants. Three variables were assessed, namely practical signaling performance, attention, and cognitive load. The results showed that the situated embodiment-based learning group had significantly higher practical signaling performance and attention, and significantly lower extrinsic cognitive load than the embodiment-based learning group. The findings suggest that the situated embodiment-based learning strategy is an effective design that can improve the procedural knowledge construction and enhance the attention level with the lower extrinsic cognitive load in a learning process. },

The educational exercise involved an initial didactic lecture followed by group exercises and individual presentations, utilizing feature films as tools for understanding the mental status examination. Each student selected a movie depicting a character with a psychiatric or substance-use disorder and performed a hypothetical mental status examination for the character, which they presented to their classmates. One hundred nine (109) students (97.3%) in the course completed evaluations of the educational exercise, and the majority found the exercise valuable; 93.6% of respondents felt that their ability to conceptualize a case had improved because of the exercise. In general evaluations of the course, this particular educational exercise was frequently mentioned in response to a free-form question about “the best part of the course.” Movies depicting psychiatric illness and substance use disorders can be a fun and highly effective tool for helping students to learn and develop competency in the performance of mental status examinations. },

  abstract={ There has been an increasing emphasis on defining outcomes of medical education in terms of ‘performance’ of trainees. This is a step beyond the description of outcomes in terms of ‘competence’ that encompasses mostly ‘potential abilities’ rather than the ‘actual performance’. The contextual adaptations and behavior judgments of the trainees are best assessed by a program of in-training assessment. Workplace based assessment (WPBA) is one of the modalities, which assesses the trainee in authentic settings. Though Postgraduate (PG) medical training in India is said to be competency-based, most institutions do not have any formative or in-training assessment program for the same. The two cardinal elements of WPBA are ‘direct observation’ and ‘conducted in work place’ in addition to provision of ‘feedback’ to the trainee. The WPBA conforms to the highest (Level 4: ‘Does’) of Miller’s pyramid and also has the potential to assess at all four levels. Some of the tools used for WPBA are: Logbooks, Clinical Encounter Cards (CEC), mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mini-CEX), Case based discussions, Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), Multisource feedback (peers, co-workers, seniors, patients) etc. These can be documented in the form of a portfolio that provides a longitudinal view of experiences and progress of the trainee. The WPBA scores high on validity and educational impact by virtue of being based on direct observation in real situation and contextual feedback. The feasibility and acceptability is enhanced by making appropriate choices of tools, advance planning, building of mutual trust, and training of assessors. Given the established benefits of WPBA in shaping clinical learning, there is an imminent need for including this mode of assessment in our clinical training programs especially PG training. },

This begs the question, are the literacy strategies recommended for content-area instruction founded in established educational theories? The purpose of the current study is to examine the implicit and explicit theories driving science disciplinary literacy instruction. Theories assist in organizing and advancing research in a systematic manner. Information on the status of theory is essential to both practitioners (who are implementing strategies) and researchers (who are making recommendations for classroom instruction). Our study revealed that in science literacy, vocabulary instructional practices are frequently supported with Schema and Dual-Coding theories. Articles also frequently used theories grounded in social dynamics, including social constructionism and sociocultural perspective, to support literacy instruction. However, recommendations for other aspects of instructional practices in science literacy are generally not well-grounded in major reading theories. },

The bidirectional self-equalization of stage evolution is used to improve the personalized recommendation of resource push, and the fuzzy adaptive binary particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the evolution state judgment is used to solve the problem of the optimal sequence recommendation, so as to realize the personalized learning resource recommendation. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher matching degree and faster recommendation speed. },

  abstract={ Flipped classroom (FC) has recently attracted researchers’ interest in teacher education thanks to its potential for promoting pre-service teachers’ (PTs) professional development. However, some of major issues are the lack of interactivity, disengagement, and amotivation of PTs for pre-class activities due to poor online instruction design. This explanatory sequential mixed study explores the effects of the microlearning-supported FC on PTs’ learning performance for professional development, motivation, and engagement. A total of 128 PTs participated in this study from a university in Turkey. In the quantitative phase, a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was conducted and the treatment lasted for 14 weeks. The PTs were divided into two experimental groups and one control groups using random sampling technique. In first experimental group (m-FC, n = 43), the participants learned with microlearning-supported (by using a-bit sized learning chunks outside the classroom) FC model. In the second experimental group (t-FC, n = 39), the participants learned with traditional FC model. A control group (non-FC, n = 46) was not taught using FC model and teacher-centered approach was adopted in this group. The findings indicated that FC model (in both experimental groups) increased learning performance, intrinsic motivation, emotional, and behavioral engagement compared to a group that was not used to FC. Moreover, m-FC group had better intrinsic motivation and engagement than both t-FC and non-FC groups. Semi-structured interviews showed that two major themes emerged regarding benefits and challenges of microlearning-supported FC. Most of PTs had positive perceptions that it enhances the willingness to participate in pre-class activities. The implications for teacher education, recommendations and directions for further studies were also discussed. },

Firstly, a SM surface-based performance index function is designed and the Hamiltonian equation is solved by the policy iteration algorithm. Secondly, the IRL technique is utilized to obtain the integral Bellman equation, which makes the controller do not need to know the drift dynamics. Thirdly, the ETC is introduced to reduce the communication burden and a triggering condition is designed to ensure the asymptotic stability of the system. Then, a critic neural network (NN) is used to learn the optimal value function to obtain the optimal tracking controller. Finally, the asymptotic stability of the whole closed-loop system and uniformly ultimately bounded of the critic NN weights are proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Simulation and comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. },

  abstract={ To measure the effectiveness of learning activities, intensive research works have focused on the process of competency building through the identification of learning stages as well as the setup of related key performance indictors to measure the attainment of specific learning objectives. To organize the learning activities as per the background and skills of each learner, individual learning styles have been identified and measured by several researchers. Despite their importance in personalizing the learning activities, these styles are difficult to implement for large groups of learners. They have also been rarely correlated with each specific learning stage. New approaches are, therefore, needed to intelligently coordinate all the learning activities while self-adapting to the ongoing progress of learning as well as to the specific requirements and backgrounds of learners. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a new framework for an intelligent management of the competency building process during learning. Our framework is based on a recursive spiral Assess-Predict-Oversee-Transit model that is orchestrated by a multi-agent system. This system is particularly responsible of enabling smart transitions between learning stages. It is also responsible of assessing and predicting the process of competency building of the learner and, then, making the right decisions about the learning progress, accordingly. Results of our solution were demonstrated via an Augmented Reality app that we created using the Unity3D engine to train learners on Air Conditioner maintenance. },

A a single group pretest-posttest weak experimental model was implemented. The participants involved in the study consisted of a group of 27 gifted students (age mean = 12.8), comprising 10 males and 17 females. The training program was implemented across three distinct sessions utilizing the Imedu VR platform. The training program used Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning principles, applying Exaggerated Feedback in the second session and Corrective Feedback in the third as instructional design elements. The initial phase encompassed a duration of 120 minutes of distance learning that emphasized Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on ocean acidification. Subsequently, participants engaged in a 30-minute IVR experience utilizing Oculus Quest 2 headsets to investigate the effect of ocean acidification on organisms and ecosystems. The final session comprised a 30-minute escape room activity conducted in a distance learning format via Imedu to reinforce what the students learned. Preceding and succeeding the intervention, students completed the Nature Relatedness (NR) Scale and the Revised New Environmental Paradigm Scale (R-NEP). Following confirmation of data normality, a paired samples t-test was employed to compare pretest and posttest scores. The study revealed a statistically significant enhancement in nature relatedness and attitudes towards environment among gifted students (p &lt; .05). Effect sizes were high for NR (Cohen’s d = 1.099) and moderate for R-NEP (Cohen’s d = 0.539). The integration of VR technologies in gifted education for cultivating nature relatedness and attitudes towards environment is thus encouraged. },

The study uses a qualitative research method to investigate pupils’ descriptions, in retrospect, on the process of their entrepreneurial work. We completed semi-structured interviews with two teachers and six groups of pupils from two schools. Independence and being able to determine their own product were motivating factors. Often the pupils included other actors, particularly family members, on their own initiative as part of their work. The pupils’ interest in STEM education did not appear to have been affected except for two pupils who broadened their educational perspective. However, the awareness of sustainability issues has for some of them been supported, one of them with a change of lifestyle. By including engineering design process models in the analyses, the concept of entrepreneurship in science and technology became more process oriented and operational, which may also help both the teachers’ facilitation and the pupils’ inventing process. },

  abstract={ This exploratory case study affirmed the merit of using science fiction-inspired story writing to help Saudi Arabian Grade 10 female students learn science. Recognizing that teacher-centered rote learning was not reaching her rural students in the western part of Riyadh Province, the female teacher in this case switched to the constructivist active learning pedagogy, especially story writing. The case study report reflects data from a teacher interview, classroom observations (n = 2), and a content analysis of students’ (N = 25) two homework assignments. In the spirit of science fiction (SF), they were required to (a) demonstrate their science learning by weaving their imagination and personalities with the world of arthropods and writing a story that reflected the values and principles they aspired to spread in society and (b) answer the third conditional sentence question “What would you ask god for if you were a Crustacean?” A content analysis confirmed that students correctly used science facts while creatively and innovatively using their imagination to write stories reflective of their value systems. They valued identity, societal recognition, validation and respect, enduring friendships, dialogue and conversations, protection, and family. Regarding the God/Crustacean question, they wanted to be happy, at peace, safe, valued, respected, and have a clean place to live. The study confirmed the value of further investigating the use of the science fiction genre in Saudi science education and using writing to learn science. },

In so doing, two groups of lecturers were recruited to participate in quantitative (n = 43) and qualitative (n = 14) phases of the research. The findings obtained from a researcher-developed questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were threefold. First, five independent evaluation measures (SETs/students’ ratings, student learning outcomes, peer evaluation, self-evaluation, and observation) were introduced. Second, features of a successful teacher evaluation system were discussed. Third, evidence for a differentiated teacher appraisal model was presented. The model discussed called for L2-specific features in L2 teacher effectiveness evaluation. The findings were imbued with several implications for the main stakeholders, e.g. administrators and teachers. },

  abstract={ A hybrid (face-to-face and online) professional development (PD) course focused on energy science for middle and high school teachers (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;47) was conducted using the teaching science as inquiry (TSI) framework. Data from the PD indicates that online opportunities enhanced participation and that the TSI structure improved teachers’ inquiry implementation. Teachers found the TSI modes of inquiry easily accessible and effectively implemented them (modes correspond to the inquiry mechanisms of investigation, such as product evaluation, authoritative, inductive, deductive, and descriptive). On the other hand, the TSI phase structure (i.e. learning cycle) was most helpful for teachers novice to inquiry teaching, suggesting that modification of the PD is needed to promote more in-depth use of the phases in the TSI framework. In terms of content, teacher interest in energy science was high, which resulted in implementation of energy science activities across a range of disciplines. However, teachers’ confidence in teaching energy science through inquiry was low compared to similar TSI PD courses on other subjects (mean perceived pedagogical content knowledge&nbsp;=&nbsp;8.96&nbsp;±&nbsp;2.07 SD for energy compared to 15.45&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.83, 16.44&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.81 and 15.63&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.69, for elementary astronomy, high school aquatic science, and college aquatic science, respectively). These data support current findings on the complexities of teaching and understanding energy science content and suggest the need for additional teacher PD opportunities in energy science in order to provide opportunities for teachers to increase both their content knowledge and their confidence in teaching energy science. },

In order to provide insight into what is known about children’s learning in museums, we examined study content, methodology and the resultant knowledge from the last decade of research. Because interactivity is increasingly seen as essential in children’s learning experiences in a museum context, we developed a framework that distinguishes between three main interactivity types for facilitating strategies and activities in children’s learning: child–adults/peers; child–technology and child–environment. We identify the most promising strategies and activities for boosting children’s learning as situated in overlapping areas of these interactivity types. Specifically, we identify scaffolding as a key to enhanced museum learning. Our review concludes by highlighting research challenges from the last decade and recommendations for practice and future research on how to design, evaluate and guide theoretically-grounded educational programs for children in museums. },

  abstract={ In a democratic society students need to cultivate independent and higher-order thought processes, and school curricula should provide students with activities facilitating this. This mode of teaching, however, is not always present in subjects like English as a Foreign or Second Language, where the focus of the instruction tends to be solely on its linguistic attributes. Thus, the researcher conducted an online historical image response project with an attempt to encourage higher-order thinking into the EFL writing course. The wiki was employed as a platform for the researcher's 18 Taiwanese university students to post responses to images for a group of American university students. The study aims to find out what higher-order thinking, if any, the participating students exhibited throughout the process, what transformation, if any, the student final writings exhibited after the implementation of the project, and what the students self-reported about the impact the project had on their thought processing. Various sources of data were collected and analyzed, including the participating students' postings on the wiki, pre-test and post-test essay writings, open-ended retrospective written surveys, and follow-up interviews with five randomly selected students. The findings indicate the following: The students exhibited higher-order thinking, especially evaluation and analysis, in their writings; their final writings displayed more thorough understandings and judgmental opinions toward the historical events than before; in addition to considering the project beneficial to their English learning, the students found it also fostered independent and critical thinking skills. In this paper the researcher reports the theoretical background that guided the construction of the project, the process of the project implementation, and the results of the project on students’ thought processes. In the end, pedagogical suggestions are made based on the findings. },

In this paper, we explore (1) what is meant by learning outcomes in diverse contexts and (2) whether policy and practice governing learning outcomes accord with developments in learning theories, especially regarding sociocultural approaches that have drawn significant interest since the 1990s (Engeström 1987; Lave and Wenger 1991). Shepard’s (Educational Researcher, 29(7), 4–14, 2000) publication is particularly salient to our examination due to her identification of an emerging paradigm to assist in the understanding of the relationships among teaching, learning and assessment. Employing recent work on conceptualisations of learning outcomes and a four-quadrant taxonomy (Prøitz in Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability, 22(2), 119–137, 2010, 2014), we discuss relevant learning theory approaches. This article is a conceptual investigation exploring the grounds for the assumption that learning can be predefined in terms of (expected) outcomes. Specifically, we discuss this assumption from the perspective of recent developments in learning theories. We argue that introducing learning outcomes predominantly for policy and management purposes may actually weaken the learning outcomes’ potential to direct teaching and learning and to improve the quality of both. },

This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student’s learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed. },

  abstract={ The recent proliferation of AI scandals led private and public organisations to implement new ethics guidelines, introduce AI ethics boards, and list ethical principles. Nevertheless, some of these efforts remained a façade not backed by any substantive action. Such behaviour made the public question the legitimacy of the AI industry and prompted scholars to accuse the sector of ethicswashing, machinewashing, and ethics trivialisation—criticisms that spilt over to institutional AI ethics boards. To counter this widespread issue, contributions in the literature have proposed fixes that do not consider its systemic character and are based on a top-down, expert-centric governance. To fill this gap, we propose to make use of qualified informed lotteries: a two-step model that transposes the documented benefits of the ancient practice of sortition into the selection of AI ethics boards’ members and combines them with the advantages of a stakeholder-driven, participative, and deliberative bottom-up process typical of Citizens’ Assemblies. The model permits increasing the public’s legitimacy and participation in the decision-making process and its deliverables, curbing the industry’s over-influence and lobbying, and diminishing the instrumentalisation of ethics boards. We suggest that this sortition-based approach may provide a sound base for both public and private organisations in smart societies for constructing a decentralised, bottom-up, participative digital democracy. },

The study use survey and quasi-experiment to sample 371 students of Junior Secondary school 1-3 who are within the age brackets of 10-12. Based on the problem and objectives of the study, research questions were formulated. Research question one to know the extent of excessive game-playing among the children, while research question two sought ascertain the relationship between excessive game-playing and the academic performance of children. A null hypothesis was also formulated and tested with the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient with the level of significance tested at 0.5 level of significance. The findings showed that a proportion of the sampled population met the criterion of addiction and the majority of the children were still non-frequent gamers. The result also showed that there is a negative correlation between excessive game-playing and academic performance as the majority of the very high scorers in tests administered on the children were from the category labelled as non-frequent and low frequent gamers. The null hypothesis that said 'there is no significant relationship between extent of excessive play and academic performance was rejected, as the r-value was -0.27. Based on these findings, it was recommended that parents should monitor their children's gaming habits and that governments should control the importation of entertainment games and encourage more of educational games. },

This article describes a successful strategic initiative to foster a partnership for researchers and health system decision-makers to promote a health system change. We identify impactful factors in a two-day integrated knowledge translation workshop bringing together practitioners, researchers, decision-makers and couples seeking services for gambling and substance use disorders. The initiative shifted awareness of decision-makers, built a network of collaborative relationships and created a consensus for action among stakeholders. This early integrated knowledge translation strategy opened up research partnership on a couple therapy randomized trial in the health system, training for counselors, and research opportunities for graduate students. },

  abstract={ To meet the intentions of the New Zealand Curriculum 2007 teachers must critically reflect on their role and their idea of what defines ‘best practice’ for teaching and learning in the twenty-first century. The teacher’s role has changed considerably over time. There is now, more than ever, a need for much greater transparency, accountability and collaborative practice within education. Famous philosophers and theorists including Plato, Rousseau and Dewey have expounded ideals of authenticity and authentic engagement, but it is only with the spread of constructivism that authenticity has gained more favour. The authors will investigate perspectives of authenticity, authentic learning, and authentic activities (Kreber et al. in Adult Educ Q Am Assoc Adult Contin Educ 58(1):22–43, 2007; Newmann in Authentic achievement: restructuring schools for intellectual quality, Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Fransisco, 1996; Newmann and Wehlage in Educ Leadersh 50(7):8–12, 1993; Reeves et al. in Quality conversations. Paper presented at the 25th HERDSA annual conference, 2002; Splitter in Stud Philos Educ 28(2):135–151, 2008). Through qualitative investigation they identify and summarise key viewpoints and demonstrate how these can be successfully implemented through programmes of technology education. A model of authentic technology for producing quality technological outcomes is presented. The authors show how an activity from an initial teacher education course in technology education uses identified aspects of authentic technological practice through the various dimensions of authenticity to develop enduring learning for students. They consider the role of context in developing learning and introduce some new ideas on successful student engagement in the field of conation (Riggs and Gholar in Strategies that promote student engagement, Corwin Press, California, 2009). Conation is defined as the will, drive and effort behind students’ engagement in learning and is increasingly seen as an integral part of authentic education. },

Methodologically, we employed Delphi study and scenario-based methods as primary techniques to collect and synthesize international experts’ opinions. A cross-sector panel of international experts from North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific participated in the study, consisting of 14 K-12 teachers, 13 academics, and 10 managers. The Delphi study was conducted in four rounds through online and face-to-face platforms: (Round I online) to generate own views on ML challenges in each of three sectors; (Round II online) to identify possible solution strategies and transferability; (Round III F2F) to develop workable solutions in small cross-sector teams; and then (Round IV online) to finalize transferability of solution strategies. Overall, the mobile learning experts identified four major challenge themes, which are risk taking (attitudes toward experimentation), matching technology to us (using technology in pedagogically sound ways), know-how (resources for information), and infrastructure (supporting structures and systems), that all sectors have been faced with. Findings suggest that perceived pedagogy and policy-related issues were the most prevalent in K-12 and higher education, while in the industry the emphasis was on technological challenges. This study also provides a synthesis of transferable solutions to some of the most significant challenges in mobile learning across sectors. },

  abstract={ The global carbon neutrality strategy brings a wave of rechargeable lithium‐ion batteries technique development and induces an ever-growing consumption and demand for lithium (Li). Among all the Li exploitation, extracting Li from spent LIBs would be a strategic and perspective approach, especially with the low energy consumption and eco-friendly membrane separation method. However, current membrane separation systems mainly focus on monotonous membrane design and structure optimization, and rarely further consider the coordination of inherent structure and applied external field, resulting in limited ion transport. Here, we propose a heterogeneous nanofluidic membrane as a platform for coupling multi-external fields (i.e., light-induced heat, electrical, and concentration gradient fields) to construct the multi-field-coupled synergistic ion transport system (MSITS) for Li-ion extraction from spent LIBs. The Li flux of the MSITS reaches 367.4&nbsp;mmol&nbsp;m−2&nbsp;h−1, even higher than the sum flux of those applied individual fields, reflecting synergistic enhancement for ion transport of the multi-field-coupled effect. Benefiting from the adaptation of membrane structure and multi-external fields, the proposed system exhibits ultrahigh selectivity with a Li+/Co2+ factor of 216,412, outperforming previous reports. MSITS based on nanofluidic membrane proves to be a promising ion transport strategy, as it could accelerate ion transmembrane transport and alleviate the ion concentration polarization effect. This work demonstrated a collaborative system equipped with an optimized membrane for high-efficient Li extraction, providing an expanded strategy to investigate the other membrane-based applications of their common similarities in core concepts. },

Language barriers are a significant obstacle to humanistic care, and trained medical interpreters have demonstrated to effectively bridge the gap for the vulnerable limited English proficiency (LEP) patient population. One way in which medical schools can train more humanistic physicians and provide language access is through the implementation of programs to train bilingual medical students as medical interpreters. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate whether such training had an impact on bilingual medical student’s interpretation skills and humanistic traits. Between 2015 and 2017, whole-day (~ 8&nbsp;h) workshops on medical interpretation were offered periodically to 80 bilingual medical students at the Penn State College of Medicine. Students completed a series of questionnaires before and after the training that assessed the program’s effectiveness and its overall impact on interpretation skills and humanistic traits. Students also had the opportunity to become certified medical interpreters. The 80 student participants were first- to third- year medical students representing 21 languages. Following training, most students felt more confident interpreting (98%) and more empathetic towards LEP patients (87.5%). Students’ scores in the multiple-choice questions about medical interpretation/role of the interpreter were also significantly improved (Chi-Square test, p &lt; 0.05). All students who decided to take the exam were able to successfully become certified interpreters. Ninety-two percent of participants reported they would recommend the program and would be willing to serve as a future “coaches” for interpreter training workshops delivered to peer students. Our program was successful in increasing self-reported measures of empathy and humanism in medical students. Our data suggests that implementation of medical interpreter training programs can be a successful strategy to develop of humanism in medical students, and aid in the development of sustainable language access for LEP patients. },

Highlighting the necessity of considering the unique cultural, social, and economic factors that influence career development in the Indian context, the paper presents the cultural preparation process model as a potential framework for the development of a career psychology for India. Data from the Work Orientations and Responses to Career Choices: Indian Regional Survey (WORCC-IRS) is presented to illustrate the model and to discuss occupational and career interests which are constructs that are central to career guidance. Data is provided to show that cultural factors such as parental approval and the attribution of prestige have a strong influence on the formation of occupational and career interests. The paper concludes with a discussion on the importance of creating a platform for the emergence of an Indian career psychology that integrates into its purview the diverse factors that influence career development in the Indian context. },

Through a methodology built on the Successive Approximation Model (SAM), this article studies learning itinerary design, implementation and assessment process, representing, through non-linear organised conceptual maps, sets of activities leading to the development of competencies that must be understood, mastered and demonstrated. Obtained results show the adequacy of a learning itinerary based on conceptual maps of the subjects’ characteristics, solving real situations through the construction and creation of new schemes and knowledge management methods while contributing to a reflection on curricular design principles using ICT and generating learning-process autonomy. },

Social media is a rich repository of multimedia content during disasters, encompassing reports on casualties, infrastructure damage, and information about missing individuals. While previous research has predominantly concentrated on textual or image analysis, the proposed study presents a multimodal middle fusion paradigm that includes Cross-modal attention and Self-attention to improve learning from both image and text modalities. Through rigorous experimentation, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed middle fusion paradigm in leveraging complementary information from both textual and visual sources.The proposed intermediate design outperforms current late and early fusion structures, achieving an accuracy of 91.53% and 91.07% in the informativeness and disaster type recognition categories, respectively. This study is among the few that examine all three tasks in the CrisisMMD dataset by combining textual and image analysis, demonstrating an approximate improvement of about 2% in prediction accuracy compared to similar studies on the same dataset.Additionally, ablation studies indicate that it outperforms the best-selected unimodal classifiers, with a 3-5% increase in prediction accuracies across various tasks. Thus, the method aims to bolster emergency response capabilities by offering more precise insights into evolving events. },

  abstract={ These days, colleges and universities have accumulated many resources in teaching and scientific research due to the acceleration of education information in China. However, many teaching resources are in short supply due to a lack of standardized resource construction and the closeness of management methods. Physical education significant teaching resources in Chinese colleges and universities must be utilized. If not integrated, it would seriously restrict the development of physical education in China. However, the traditional management of physical education teaching resources tends to worsen the data management, which is easy to cause the loss of physical education teaching resources data. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and other technologies, intelligent edge cloud computing can ensure the integrity of physical education teaching resources and improve utilization. In this paper, cloud computing is used to manage physical education teaching resources in colleges and universities, and virtualization technology is used to research physical education teaching resources. Moreover, a resource scheduling method is proposed to ensure equal load distribution across various edge resources. The proposed strategy also provides increased utilization levels for computing resources. The comparison between the sports teaching resources under cloud computing and traditional sports teaching resources found that cloud resource management's sharing degree of teaching equipment has increased by 20.6% compared with conventional resource management. The sharing degree of courses has increased by 16.5%, and the utilization rate of sports venues has increased by 27.1% compared with traditional resource management. The utilization rate of sports film and television materials increased by 30.7%. Teachers and students benefit significantly from college and university teaching resources in the context of cloud computing. It demonstrates how cloud computing may assist colleges and universities in managing and integrating their teaching resources more effectively. The management and integration of college sports resources through cloud computing can promote the mutual exchange of college resources and have practical significance for the development of college education. },

After achieving technological advancements, further improving people's living standards will become the first priority, and indicators concerning quality of life will become more important, including spiritual needs, environmental conditions and social order. In particular, the degree of spiritual and cultural satisfaction is a prominent indicator for consideration. The current research investigates how new-age art is changing and how it may affect society dynamics in the future. It explores how new-age art, as a phenomenon in culture, adjusts to shifting environments, emphasizing the social roles, realization of values, and influencing elements of the art. With a focus on spiritual and cultural fulfillment, the study highlights the value of art in improving people's quality of life while taking into account elements such as social order, environmental influences, and spiritual demands. The primary goal is to comprehend the ways in which new age art raises living standards and general well-being. The results demonstrate the lasting contributions that new-age art makes to enjoyment, cultural transmission, and education, thereby reaffirming its important position in society. The paper emphasizes how crucial the socialist culture sector with Chinese characteristics will become to the future economic framework. This study found that new-age art continuously produces excellent literary and artistic works in addition to preserving traditional Chinese culture and fostering cultural self-confidence through its support for the improvement of living standards and industrial growth. This illustrates its practical importance in upholding economic supremacy and promoting cultural advancement. },

  abstract={ While previous classroom studies of status hierarchies tell us who has low status and how to increase those learners’ participation in small group contexts via teacher-led interventions, we know little about how one becomes low status, or the role peers play in legitimating or delegitimating inequitable relations. This study used the sociocultural concept of marginal non-participation to describe interactional moves learners use to navigate status hierarchies in an inquiry science context where student authority may permit learners to obstruct peers’ participation. Participants were three collaborative groups of 3–4 learners in 7th grade science classrooms where a series of inquiry curriculum units were being implemented. Interviews were used alongside a microgenetic analysis of video-recorded group work observations to identify interactions that legitimated and delegitimated status hierarchies. Legitimation involved communicating acceptance of differential belonging and competence while delegitimation involved challenging differential reward by fostering widespread participation. Low- and high-status group members were active in both processes. Results suggest that diffuse status characteristics and science capital inform how status hierarchies are negotiated and that learners adapt disciplinary norms for status legitimating and delegitimating ends. Implications for learners’ participation in scientific practices and identification with science are discussed. },

Relying upon this literature, we evaluate several common reservations regarding the governance of pre-deployment research and testing including covert deployment, technological lock-in, weaponization, slippery slope, and the blurry line between research and deployment. We conclude that these reservations are no longer supported by literature. However, we do not argue that there is no reason for concern. Instead, we enumerate alternative bases for caution about research into stratospheric aerosol injection which are supported by an up-to-date understanding of the literature. We conclude that in order to establish the correct degree and type of governance for stratospheric aerosol injection research, the research community must focus its attention on these well-grounded reservations. However, while these reservations are supported and warrant further attention, we conclude that none currently justifies restrictive governance of early-stage stratospheric aerosol injection research. },

Organizational theories are employed to highlight the professional learning experienced by nursery staff through types of learning (formal, informal, and non-formal) and organizational learning analysis (single, double, and triple loops of learning). Qualitative data was collected through unstructured interviews, observations, and document analysis and was gathered in two sessions of three months during one academic year. This study focuses on voices from the learning communities in one early year's classroom in a state school located in Andalusia, in the south of Spain. Twelve early years staffers—including teachers, teaching assistants, managerial team, and external professionals—and six parents and 24 children were observed, including two children diagnosed with special education needs (SEN). This case study shows that a dearth of essential elements such as communication and responsibility networks, a non-permeable system, and resource management policies result in a lack of capability to offer professional development to nursery staff to meet children's educational needs. },

  abstract={ In the healthcare systems of the world, reinforcing the competence and professionalism of nurses has become a concern. Gaining clinical nursing competence in the healthcare system requires more effort, and additional training is required. Medical education and training have begun using digital technologies, such as virtual reality (VR). The purpose of this research was to examine the efficacy of VR in terms of cognitive, emotional, and psychomotor outcomes and learning satisfaction in nurses. The study searched eight databases (Cochrane library, EBSCOHost, Embase, OVID MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for articles that met these criteria: (i) nursing staff, (ii) any virtual reality technology intervention for education, all levels of immersion, [1] randomized control trial and quasi-experiment study, and (iv) published articles and unpublished theses. The standardized mean difference was measured. The random effect model was applied to measure the main outcome of the study with a significance level of p &lt; .05. The I2 statistic assessment was applied to identify the level of heterogeneity of the study. A total of 6740 studies were identified, of which 12 studies with 1470 participants met the criteria for inclusion. The meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in the cognitive aspect (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.48; 95% CI = 0.33–2.63; p = .011, I2 = 94.88%), the affective aspect (SMD = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.34–0.86; p &lt; .001, I2 = 34.33%), the psychomotor aspect (SMD = 0.901; 95% CI = 0.49–1.31; p &lt; .001, I2 = 80.33%), and learning satisfaction (SMD = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.17–0.77; p = .002, I2 = 0%) aspects of the groups that received the VR intervention compared to the control groups. Subgroup analysis found that dependent variables (e.g., level of immersion) did not improve study outcomes. The quality of evidence was low which is affected by major methodological issues. VR may favorable as alternative method to increase nurse competencies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on larger samples are needed to strengthen the evidence for the effect of VR in various clinical nurse settings. ROSPERO registration number: CRD42022301260. },

  abstract={ Oases of learning which are transformative and lead to significant behavioural change can be found around the globe. Transformational learning has helped learners not only to understand what they have been taught but also to re-conceptualise and re-apply this understanding to their daily lives. Unfortunately, as many global reports indicate, inspirational transformational learning approaches for sustainable development are rare and have yet to become the norm – despite calls for such approaches by several outstanding educators and organisations. This article examines three learning approaches developed by the network of the Partnership for Education and Research about Responsible Living (PERL). These approaches are structured around core elements of transformative learning for sustainable development, yet focus particularly on the ability to care, consult with others and be creative. They seem to depend on the learners’ ability to articulate their perceptions of sustainable development in relation to their own values and to identify how these are actualised in their daily life. Together with other core elements of transformative learning, an almost magical (not precisely measurable) synergy then emerges. The intensity of this synergy appears to be directly related to the individual learner’s understanding of the contradictions, interlinkages and interdependencies of modern society. The impact of this synergy seems to be concurrent with the extent to which the learner engages in a continual learning process with those with whom he/she has contact. The findings of this study suggest that mainstreaming transformational learning for sustainable development in ways that release the “magic synergy of creative caring” can result in the emergence of individuals who are willing and able to move from “business as usual” towards more socially just, economically equitable, and environmentally sensitive behaviour. },

Since effective teaching asks for alignment between teaching and assessment practices, the increasing diversity challenges teachers’ assessment practices and schools’ assessment policies as well. This study will explore these practices and policies in schools with a diverse student population. To this end, data was collected in 2017 through case studies in six primary schools, three of which are characterized by a heterogeneous pupil composition and three of which have a homogeneous composition. The data collection includes interviews with six school principals and 24 teachers in primary education, six of whom are employed in pre-primary education. Although the results show a variety in reported assessment practices, there is no evidence for differences linked to schools’ pupil composition. This study emphasizes the crucial role of an assessment policy at the school level, as it serves as a condition for high-quality assessment practices that support effective teaching, while also responding to the challenges of diversity. },

Neurodidactics is an educational paradigm that addresses optimization of the learning and teaching process from the perspective of how the brain functions. In this context, the features extracted can be fed as input into various machine learning algorithms to predict the students’ performance. The proposed approach was tested with data from an international course with 698 students. Accuracies greater than 0.99 were obtained in predicting the students’ final performance. The best model was achieved with the Random Forest algorithm. It selected 7 relevant features, all with a clear interpretation in the learning process. These features are related to the principles of neurodidactics, and reflect the importance of a social learning and constructivist approach in this context. This work constitutes a first step in relating the tools of learning analytics to neurodidactics. The method, after its adaptation to capture relevant features corresponding to different contexts, could be implemented on other management learning platforms, and applied to other online courses with the aim of predicting the students’ performance, including real-time tracking of their progress and risk of dropout. },

Thematic analysis revealed that ChatGPT could support writers at the pre-writing, during-writing and post-writing stages and serve as a self-learning tool for writing and thinking development with its human and non-human features. Nonetheless, its generative nature also gave rise to concerns for learning loss, authorial voice, unintelligent texts, academic integrity as well as social and safety risks.

  abstract={ The present study focuses on high school students' acceptance of digital comics creation (DCC) in classroom learning and aims at identifying the factors that affect it. The DCC is a modern ICT activity, which combines the popular and familiar to students medium of comics with the computers. The research model used to explain the students' preference for DCC is based on the technology acceptance model. A partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data and examine our research model and corresponding hypotheses. The results confirm the acceptance of the model and show that students' preference for DCC is directly influenced by perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Among them, the perceived enjoyment is the stronger influencing factor. Digital comics creation self-efficacy was a significant indirect factor of students’ preference for DCC through perceived ease of use. It is important that teachers take these into consideration and incorporate ICT activities that students enjoy, perceive them as useful and easy to use in order to capture their interest. Teachers should also enhance students’ self-efficacy when providing them with ICT systems. Further relationships among the aforementioned factors and future research directions are also discussed. },

  abstract={ Post-graduate teacher recruitment schemes are designed to fulfil ongoing teaching shortages. However, despite the emphasis of technology integration in educational contexts, little research has examined the knowledge, skills and attitudes post-graduate pre-service teachers bring to teaching from a technology perspective. This paper presents findings from the final phase of an explanatory case study exploring the development of post-graduate pre-service teachers’ technology integration beliefs and practice during a teacher education program at an Australian university. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 post-graduate pre-service teachers after two professional (field) experiences. A social cognitive lens was applied to understand how technology integration beliefs and practice developed during this time. Results showed occupation-specific technology experience provided this group with a diversity of technology expertise, confidence using technology, resilience to overcome technical issues, and self-regulatory traits to learn new technology tools. Contributing personal factors influencing beliefs and practice included age, professional background, technology skills and technology self-efficacy beliefs. Initial practice revealed a predilection to integrate technology to supplement teacher-directed pedagogy. The shift towards technology integration to support student-centred pedagogy was dependent upon modelling and mentoring provisions offered by both teacher-educators and teacher-mentors during professional (field) experience placements. Other extrinsic factors, such as hardware provisions, Information Technology infrastructure, and school culture, were also instrumental in the conceptualization and realization of technology pedagogy. Recommendations include the necessity for post-graduate teacher education programs to recognise the untapped technology expertise this group may bring to teaching, and practical suggestions to support the development of meaningful technology integration epistemologies. },

  abstract={ In today’s fast changing and unpredictable world we tend to rely upon children’s agency to ensure their survival following traumatic events. Because of this, parents and teachers need to be conversant with ways of encouraging children’s agency to support their health and efficacy throughout the lifespan. This paper takes the form of a literature review covering historical and recent developments in the field of childhood, child abuse and child agency. It offers the findings of a qualitative document study that aimed to explore how childhood and child agency have been conceptualized historically in the Western world. It begins with a summary of theories and typologies of childhood throughout history, exploring the unique social and historical concepts in which theories of childhood and child agency developed. Furthermore, a paradigm shift in Western society towards women achieving agency is revealed. With this came greater attention to the child, especially the abused child. Focusing on abuse to which children have been exposed, this study looks at child agency and how it can be actualized for children’s wellbeing. Research findings make a strong case for the arts to provide valuable tools of resilience for the developing child. Arts-based activities have been increasingly appreciated as providing a voice for traumatized or abused children. Therefore, the findings of this study into agency and child abuse were distilled into a poem to demonstrate the potential impact on a child and to help adults better understand the historically perceived voiceless victim. The poem, as seen from the perspective of the child, offers a distinctive contribution to the literature on child abuse. Key findings of this study are discussed, including the importance of increasing understanding of children’s agency. It is argued that a shift in childrearing, incorporated child protection laws and agentic experiences build children’s confidence to challenge the traditional adult-child power relationship. The results of this research help to contribute to teacher knowledge about the intricate background to child abuse and child agency. },

  abstract={ Self-reflection and reflective practice are increasingly considered as essential attributes of competent professionals functioning in complex and ever-changing healthcare systems of the 21st century. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of students' awareness and understanding of the reflective process and the meaning of 'self-reflection' within the contextual framework of their learning environment in the first-year of their medical/dental education. We endorse that the introduction of such explicit educational tasks at this early stage enhances and promotes students' awareness, understanding, and proficiency of this skill in their continuing life-long health professional learning. Over two years, students registered in first-year pathology at the University of Saskatchewan were introduced to a self-reflection assignment which comprised in the submission of a one-page reflective document to a template of reflective questions provided in the given context of their learning environment. This was a mandatory but ungraded component at the midterm and final examinations. These documents were individually analyzed and thematically categorized to a "5 levels-of-reflection-awareness" scale using a specially-designed rubric based on the accepted major theories of reflection that included students' identification of: 1) personal abilities, 2) personal learning styles 3) relationships between course material and student history 4) emotional responses and 5) future applications. 410 self-reflection documents were analyzed. The student self-awareness on personal learning style (72.7% level 3+) and course content (55.2% level 3+) were well-reflected. Reflections at a level 1 awareness included identification of a) specific teaching strategies utilized to enhance learning (58.4%), b) personal strengths/weaknesses (53%), and c) emotional responses, values, and beliefs (71.5%). Students' abilities to connect information to life experiences and to future events with understanding were more evenly distributed across all 5 levels of reflection-awareness. Exposure to self-reflection assignments in the early years of undergraduate medical education increases student awareness and promotes the creation of personal meaning of one's reactions, values, and premises in the context of student learning environments. Early introduction with repetition to such cognitive processes as practice tools increases engagement in reflection that may facilitate proficiency in mastering this competency leading to the creation of future reflective health professionals. },

  abstract={ Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has emerged as a revolutionary welding technique, offering numerous advantages in joining dissimilar materials with enhanced mechanical properties. However, ensuring the quality and reliability of FSW joints remains a critical challenge, necessitating the development of advanced modeling, prediction, and defect detection techniques. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has gained traction as a powerful tool for addressing these challenges in FSW processes. This comprehensive review explores the cutting-edge applications of ML in modeling, prediction, and defect detection for FSW. The review discusses various ML techniques employed in FSW, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DT), and deep learning (DL) architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Furthermore, the review examines the importance of defect detection in FSW, highlighting the significance of early identification and mitigation of defects for ensuring structural integrity and performance. Additionally, the review discusses the advantages and limitations of ML approaches in FSW defect detection, addressing key challenges such as data availability, interpretability, and computational complexity. Through an in-depth analysis of recent research studies and case studies, this review provides valuable insights into the state-of-the-art applications of ML in FSW, paving the way for future advancements in quality control and process optimization in welding applications. },

With a main focus on cognitive psychology, educational psychology, educational technology and instructional design, this internationally well-known scholar reflects on the work conducted within the mathematics education community. This paper presents a summary of the comments and reflections that he expressed during the interview. A first main theme relates to the general idea behind the special issue, i.e. the feasibility of applying cognitive theory-based instructional design principles in the field of mathematics education. Second, the interview related to the set of instructional design principles that were included in the special issue and those that were omitted. Third, reflections are made on the differences between the application of instructional design principles in mathematics education research and in instructional design research more generally. One main idea running through this interview is that, according to Kirschner, mathematics education research is not necessarily a special field in its own, as the variation of instructional goals and of research foci within mathematics education is at least as large as the variation across different content domains. },

To do this, it must promote competence-based learning through active teaching methodologies. This study will analyse the use of Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodologies in the context of transversal subjects, as an efficient technique to develop interpersonal communication and teamworking skills. This research is quasi-experimental, with a pre-test/post-test design with an equivalent control group. The sample consists of 610 university students from the Community of Madrid, of whom 387 participated in the PBL (Experimental Group: EG) and 223 did not (Control Group: CG). A reliable and validated questionnaire on personal competences was used as a measurement instrument. The hypotheses on the effectiveness of PBL as a technique for the development of interpersonal communication and teamworking skills in the context of transversal subjects are confirmed. The results suggest that greater use of active methodologies to promote the development of transversal or generic competences is highly recommended and that the insertion of transversal subjects into university curricula may be highly beneficial. },

Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press, 2009) as the First, Second and Third Way that defined global educational policy and practice since the 1960s. It then introduces the main tenets of the Fourth Way, which is characterised by inspiring success stories of educational leadership and change that have led to remarkable leaps forward in student learning and achievement. The Fourth Way is distinguished by a paradigm shift in the change mindset of educational leaders of how they push educational frontiers to achieve a more sustainable future. It is defined not merely as a destination but a journey in itself. Second, it considers how Singapore presents an interesting case study of paving the Fourth Way through its many forward-looking educational initiatives and fidelity in the implementation of these reforms. In doing so, this article also sets the stage for the other articles in this volume which cover different aspects of the Singapore education story, from pre-primary to tertiary education, to teacher preparation, and leadership development to the internationalization of its teacher education programmes and how educational research translates into policy and practice in this unique nation. },

It has also been possible to conclude the existence of some significant differences regarding gender in some aspects related to the curricular mediation of video games in which males are more inclined towards their use, as well as in regard to their personal relationship with this theme. Therefore, it can be inferred that video games can be used in the education of children at the primary stage. },

We elaborate on the concept of a purposive value orientation in dialogic pedagogy. We show how the teacher used the social practice of Song of the Week (SOTW) to mediate the embodiment, enactment, and development of a shared ‘chronotope’ of ‘our community values’. We argue that a dialogic value-orientation positively impacts how the talk and interaction of language and literacy practices are taken up in a classroom community. },

At the best of times, animals, cadavers and patients constituted the «surface» on which surgeons would train, but whichever the model of simulation, it was not without its disadvantages. The evolution of laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery, mainly based on monitor-image, lacked 3-dimensional image information and haptic feedback; this shortcoming, along with the difficulties in eye-hand coordination, dictated the need to seek a new simulating model. The development of surgical virtual reality-simulators (VR — simulators) can offer a much-needed new dimension to the training of novice surgeons, students and residents by providing a safe and viable alternative. Models of a virtual patient can provide an evolved and realistic human anatomy that can simulate normal and pathological conditions in a virtual reality environment. In addition, VR-simulators can provide a structured learning environment with controlled levels of difficulty. Training in a virtual reality environment could help surgeons to overcome the two most common difficulties in image-guided surgery: the lack of tactile and three-dimensional image information. Equally important is the training in a VR — environment, which could help surgeons avoid errors during real surgical performance. The level of transferrable learning to the operating room is acceptable. },

While several studies have begun exploring its effects on oral task repetition, little attention has been paid to the effects of spacing in writing task repetition and its interaction with learners’ emotional states (i.e., enjoyment and anxiety). Focusing on 270 learners studying English as their second language (ESL) in the U.S., the current study examined their writing performance and emotions in the same decision-making task under three different schedules: (1) in one class (massed practice), (2) with a two-day interval (short-spaced practice), and (3) with a one-week interval (long-spaced practice). Following each writing session, learners completed a questionnaire assessing their anxiety and enjoyment during the task. The results showed that the long-spaced group outperformed the other groups after the experiment in general syntactic complexity, phrasal complexity, and lexical diversity, and they also experienced lower anxiety and higher enjoyment. Conversely, the massed group had lower achievements in phrasal complexity and lexical diversity and experienced lower enjoyment and higher anxiety than the other groups. These findings suggest that the interval between task repetitions can significantly influence learners’ writing performance and emotional states. },

Exploratory factor analyses, correlation, and regression analyses were conducted. Results revealed and confirmed five factors: knowledge and access to resources, supportive network and optimism for challenges, culturally sustaining traditions and practices, spiritual promoting practices, and diverse communication and connection channels. While some differences were found based on income and parental education, there were no differences by family structure. Validation analyses indicated that family cultural wealth was associated with parental experiences of discrimination and parent emotional distress but not child behavioral problems. These findings suggest that the FCWS has adequate psychometrics, making it a potential tool for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers as they ensure that programs and strategies leverage the assets of racially marginalized families. },

This study aims to explore preservice teachers’ perceptions and needs of online course design elements in the context of feedback and collaborative learning. Instructional Technology course was selected to investigate the perceptions and needs of pre-service teachers towards online course structure. A total of 191 pre-service teachers participated in this study. A semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher was used as a data collection tool. Content analysis was conducted to analyze the qualitative responses to open-ended questions. The results of this study showed that the most important factors affecting students’ perceptions in online courses were interactive learning tools, personalised feedback, knowledge sharing environments, practice activities, generative activities, tools to support communication skills and sociability, structures to reflect on meeting course expectations, accessible assessment criteria, feedback from instructors, and online course structure. Feedback was also a factor affecting students’ collaborative work. The introduction and use of tools to monitor group work and support collaboration were considered important by the participants for in-group collaboration. In terms of presentation of content, preservice teachers in online courses valued summary and providing prior learning documents and materials explaining the steps of implementation”. In addition, it was observed that verbal and guided feedback was frequently used in online courses. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to investigate whether or not the use of video can have a positive effect on satisfaction, empathy, and learning achievement in problem-based instruction among Korean college students majoring in education. To achieve this purpose, this study compared the findings from three dependent variables in problem-based video instruction with those in problem-based text instruction. The results indicate that there were statistically significant differences in learner satisfaction, empathy, and learning achievement between students who received problem-based video instruction and students who received problem-based text instruction. Consequently, the findings of this study imply that video can be an effective medium to present authentic situations in order to enhance student satisfaction, empathy, and learning achievement in problem-based instruction. This study might be significant in expanding the potential use of problem-based video instruction and in establishing an example of problem-based video instruction for Korean college students majoring in education. },

  abstract={ We conducted (I) 18 event-related potential (ERP) field tests to detect concealed information regarding major terrorist crimes and other real-world crimes and (II) 5 ERP tests regarding participation in a classified counterterrorism operation. This study is a test of the brain fingerprinting scientific standards hypothesis: that a specific set of methods for event-related potential (ERP) concealed information tests (CIT) known as the brain fingerprinting scientific standards provide the sufficient conditions to produce less than 1% error rate and greater than 95% median statistical confidence for individual determinations of whether the tested information is stored in each subject’s brain. All previous published results in all laboratories are compatible with this hypothesis. We recorded P300 and P300-MERMER ERP responses to visual text stimuli of three types: targets contain known information, irrelevants contain unknown/irrelevant information, and probes contain the situation-relevant information to be tested, known only to the perpetrator and investigators. Classification CIT produced significantly better results than comparison CIT, independent of classification criteria. Classification CIT had 0% error rate; comparison CIT had 6% error rate. As in previous studies, classification-CIT median statistical confidences were approximately 99%, whereas comparison CIT statistical confidences were no better than chance for information-absent (IA) subjects (who did not know the tested information). Over half of the comparison-CIT IA determinations were invalid due to a less-than-chance computed probability of being correct. Experiment (I) results for median statistical confidence: Classification CIT, IA subjects: 98.6%; information-present (IP) subjects (who know the tested information): 99.9%; comparison CIT, IA subjects: 48.7%; IP subjects: 99.5%. Experiment (II) results (Classification CIT): error rate 0%, median statistical confidence 96.6%. Countermeasures had no effect on the classification CIT. These results, like all previous results in our laboratory and all others, support the brain fingerprinting scientific standards hypothesis and indicate that the classification CIT is a necessary condition for a reliable, accurate, and valid brainwave-based CIT. The comparison CIT, by contrast, produces high error rates and IA statistical confidences no better than chance. },

Treatment of tendon allograft with hydrogen peroxide at the beginning of tissue processing may reduce bacterial contamination, however, the potential side effects of hydrogen peroxide treatment include hydrolysis of the collagen and this may alter the mechanical properties of the graft. Pairs of human tendons were used. One was washed in 3&nbsp;% hydrogen peroxide for 5&nbsp;min and the untreated tendon was used as a control. The ultimate tensile strength of the tendons was determined using a material testing machine. A freeze clamp technique was used to hold the tendons securely at the high loads required to cause tendon failure. There was no statistical difference in the ultimate tensile strength between the treated and untreated tendons. Mean strength ranged from Extensor Hallucis Longus at 588 Newtons to Tibialis Posterior at 2,366 Newtons. Hydrogen peroxide washing may reduce bacterial contamination of tendon allograft and does not affect the strength of the tendon. },

  abstract={ To enhance the quality of STEAM activities and contribute to the ongoing progress of STEAM education, this study was meticulously designed to focus on assessing STEAM competence—an integral objective within the realm of STEAM education. Employing established theories, previous research, and empirical investigations, a cohort of 1,098 primary school students from three distinct educational institutions actively participated in a comprehensive questionnaire. The investigation rigorously examined structural components, reliability, validity, and various analytical methodologies, including exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis, and scalar invariance, with a specific emphasis on paternal occupation and gender distinctions. Data collection and analysis were executed using SPSS 25.0 and Mplus 8.3 software, leading to the development of a primary-factor CFA model, path analysis outcomes, Pearson correlation analysis, as well as reliability and validity assessments, all contributing to a well-fitting model. The scrutiny of invariance extended across gender and paternal occupation groups at the configural, metric, and scalar levels. Additionally, this paper delves into exploring the intricate interrelationships among diverse indicators, providing a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted aspects of STEAM competence. },

In this study, we carry out a qualitative study of an aspiring teacher entrepreneur’s journey in designing and holding their first STEM course, in a non-profit informal STEM Center to investigate the teacher’s entrepreneurial competencies and the effects of their environment on their work. Our findings show how the exhibited competencies of the teacher participant differed compared to existing literature on teacher entrepreneurs and which competencies were not seen and why. Length of program and stakeholder expectations were seen as challenges specifically arising from the nature of the non-profit informal STEM setting the teacher worked in. Possible solutions to such challenges are presented and implications for supporting and educating teacher entrepreneurs are also explained. Our study contributes to literature on teacher entrepreneurship, novice teacher progress, and informal STEM learning environments. },

  abstract={ This paper deals with multi-agent energy management and fault tolerant control of the micro-grid powered by wind farm based on two doubly fed induction generators. The stator flux orientation has used to eliminate the active and reactive power coupling. The proposed control scheme is based on two cascades closed loops. The inner controllers concern the rotor currents. The outer controllers have a parallel configuration with the stator voltage or the stator power control. Switching between these two controllers is realized by the synchronization mechanism. All controllers are designed with Lyapunov approach associated with sliding-mode control, this solution shows good robustness against parameter variations, measurement errors and faults. The global asymptotic stability of the overall system is proven. After that, a Multi-agent energy management was proposed and tested in order to satisfy some objectives and overcome some constraints. The advantages of the wind energy integration associated with multi-agent energy management are: production cost minimization, reduction of the carbon emissions, increasing the energy autonomy and he robustness against weather conditions and faults that may occur during operation. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control. },

However, not all talents and skills have equal utility value in all societies. Thus, societies tend to suppress some and support others (via education or social policies). STEM represents the U.S. policy to support a narrow set of skills and talents/interests and suppress non-STEM skills. As the human society enters a different time, we have witnessed the rising value of other talents/skills. This paper brings evidence to show how traditionally undervalued talents/interests (arts, music, entertainment, global competency—translators/interpreters, interpersonal/intrapersonal, etc.) have gained value as human beings acquire more disposal income and leisure time to be able to consume psychological and spiritual products. The paper also discusses the potential danger of an excessive focus on STEM in education. },

This extends to the design and development of healthcare technology where the involvement of users has been found to positively impact the quality and safety of products. However, there is currently little known about which methods are the most appropriate for involving children in technology development. The research applied and developed a framework to guide the use of methods in the design and development of healthcare technology for upper limb rehabilitation in children with cerebral palsy. Utilising an assessment framework to explore the suitability of four interview methods for involving children in the design and development of healthcare technology, research was carried out in primary schools in the United Kingdom. The research team i) used the assessment framework to guide the collection of information for comparing methods for involving children; ii) considered additional criteria for inclusion in the framework; and iii) gathered observations and data to comment on the criteria in relation to the four interview methods. Children were able to participate in all four interview methods, although further consideration is needed to identify how children with disabilities can be involved in design activities forming part of interview methods. Differences were found between the methods relating to their robustness, reliability, validity, efficiency, enjoyment and cost. The involvement of participants with a disability highlighted the need to develop new methods that support their inclusion in healthcare technology design work. The assessment framework applied in this research was useful to inform the comparison of methods and represents a step towards a more unified approach to understanding how best to capture the perspectives of children to develop technology that meets their needs. },

Fifty senior university students participated in a project-based course with two key organizational features: first, a web system (PEGASUS) was developed to help students identify their learning styles and distribute them to heterogeneous groups. Second, group facilitation meetings were introduced as a technique to help students reflect on their weak/strong traits and employ appropriate roles in their group. The study research questions focused mainly on students’ attitudes regarding the learning style-based group formation approach. By applying qualitative research method students’ views were recorded about the impact of styles awareness and group heterogeneity on group collaboration and possible benefits and drawbacks related to the style-based grouping approach. Evaluation data revealed that students gradually overcame their initial reservations for the innovative group formation method and were highly benefited since styles heterogeneity within the group emphasized complementarities and pluralism in students’ ways of thinking. Overall, this work provides evidence that the adoption of learning styles theories in practice can be facilitated by systems for automated group formation and supportive group facilitation meetings that help avoiding the trivial and discouraging approach of using learning styles to simply label students. },

  abstract={ Morocco is a multilingual country with a diverse culture. When it participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) for the first time, its reading literacy scores ranked relatively low in the test. Employing hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), the present study examined the effects of both student- and school-level factors on students’ reading literacy in Morocco. Student-level (N = 5800) and school-level (N = 179) data were drawn from the PISA 2018. The results showed that students’ reading literacy differed significantly across schools, accounting for about 40.5% of the overall variation. Further, the results showed that at the student level, when the variables of gender and family indices (i.e., economic, social, and cultural status) were controlled, language spoken at home, understanding and remembering of meta-cognition, self-concept of reading, expected occupational status, adaptation to instruction, teacher support in test language lessons, and duration in early childhood education and care all had significant effects on students’ reading literacy. At the school level, school location, school type, school size, shortage of educational material, and proportion of highly educated teachers had a crucial influence on student reading literacy, either directly or indirectly. To date, the reasons for these effects have not been systematically investigated. Morocco was the only African country to take part in the PISA test and it would be worthwhile to explore the factors affecting reading literacy in this low-performing country. Further, the results may be applicable to some extent to low reading performance in other countries. },

Here, Hans-Christoph Diener and colleagues review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of MOH, and suggest strategies for prevention and treatment. Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders as a headache in patients with a pre-existing primary headache disorder that occurs on ≥15 days per month for &gt;3 months, and is caused by overuse of medication intended for acute or symptomatic headache treatment. The prevalence of MOH in the general population is around 1%, but the condition is much more common in people with headache, in particular chronic migraine. The phenotype of the headache in MOH depends on the initial primary headache and the type of overused acute medication. In this Review, we will discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of MOH. Treatment of MOH is performed in three steps: educating patients about the relationship between frequent intake of acute headache medication and MOH with the aim to reduce intake of acute medication; initiation of migraine prevention (such as topiramate or onabotulinumtoxin A in migraine) in patients who fail step 1; detoxification on an outpatient basis or in a day hospital or inpatient setting, depending on severity and comorbidities. The success rate of treatment is around 50–70%, although patients whose MOH is associated with opioid overuse have higher relapse rates. In all patients with MOH, relapse rates can be reduced by patient education and care in the follow-up period. },

The researchers conducted two rounds of focus groups and individual interviews to explore the perceptions of the participants after the introduction of the new program. Our findings suggest that program change is demanding for ECE educators and many of our participants were initially resistant to changing their praxis. However, by the second round of data collection many of the teachers were beginning to adapt to the demands of child-centered ECE and their professional perceptions had changed. We conclude that although ECE program change is demanding, it can be achieved quickly if the process is well understood and supported by leadership/stakeholders. Also, our study suggests that in-service training can be a powerful tool for facilitating ECE program change and teacher development. },

The article focuses on the clinical component of the preservice curriculum (practice teaching and methods courses). It reveals that curriculum became malleable in two major ways: there was (1) a shift to learner-centered well-being and social emotional learning (SEL); and (2) an adaptation of teaching methods. The Covid-19 shutdown imposed a restructuring of the content, sequence, and scope of the curriculum. While certain topics were omitted or reduced in scope, others—especially those related to digital instruction—were introduced or expanded. Pedagogy instructors also began to attend to their students’ well-being by introducing SEL contents and activities. This response during challenging times revealed teacher educators’ adaptability, resilience, and agency. The Covid-19 breakout transformed the curriculum from a traditional pre-planned and structured syllabus to one that is more responsive, dynamic, and malleable. },

We examined eight conversations among subsets of 29 experienced geometry teachers with respect to how they described students and the mathematical work they perceived students to be engaged in. Across the study group conversations, participants described students in terms of the tasks’ mathematical resources which students could understand or misunderstand and the tasks’ material and social resources which they could use or misuse, but participants paid little attention to the operations that students might employ in the task or the goals that students were working toward in the task. This study suggests that, when supporting students’ work on conjecturing tasks, teachers focus on the tasks’ resources which students use. This conjecture suggests in turn that in exchanging students’ work on conjecturing tasks for claims that students have learned a bit of the geometry curriculum, teachers might deem that particular work valuable on account of the resources used. },

  abstract={ The aim of this paper is to provide an exploratory overview of second-language classroom activities that can be used in order to stimulate students’ collocational and colligational fluency. For at least two decades, it has been acknowledged in second language vocabulary acquisition research that lexical proficiency extends beyond knowledge of single words, and thus, learners should be given exposure to longer stretches of language, i.e., what is sometimes referred to as “chunks”. After briefly discussing the motivation behind this theoretical stance, this paper will present and discuss a range of strategies that learners can successfully employ to notice, store and actively produce the many multi-word expressions that make up the bulk of language in use. The relevance of the current study lies primarily in its pedagogical implications. The selection of strategies has been based on a review of the current literature into the teaching of phraseology as well as the author’s own reflective practice. One of the main findings to emerge from this paper is that though many strategies have been suggested, only a small minority has been subjected to empirical or experimental verification, and that practitioners like curriculum developers, materials writers and teachers should be advised to judge the available array of activities critically. },

  abstract={ In this mixed-methods study, the effect of training teacher–researchers in a collaborative research environment is examined for a cohort of teachers enrolled in a Math and Science Partnership (MSP) master’s degree program. The teachers describe changes in their research views and in their application of research in practice, and detail the challenges they faced during the process. The findings of the study suggest training teachers as researchers is likely to encourage teacher interest in conducting and applying theory in math and science classrooms. The results of this study have implications for bridging the gap between theory and practice in math and science education in general. },

  abstract={ Epilepsy is a common and diverse set of chronic neurological disorders characterized by spontaneous, unprovoked, and recurrent epileptic seizures. Environmental factors and acquired disposition are proposed to play a role to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Genetic factors are important contributors as well. Comparing to the phenotype of epilepsy caused by mutation of single gene on an autosome, the phenotype of X-linked epilepsy is more complex. X-linked epilepsy usually manifests as part of a syndrome or epileptic encephalopathy, and the variability of clinical manifestations of X-linked epilepsy may be attributed to several factors including the type of genetic mutation, methylation, X chromosome random inactivation, and mosaic distribution. As a result, it is difficult to establish the genotype–phenotype correlation, diagnostic tests, and genetic counseling. In this review, we provide an overview of the X-linked epilepsy including responsible loci and genes, the molecular biology, the associated complex phenotypes, and the interference factors. This information may provide us a better understanding of the pathogenesis of X-linked epilepsy and may contribute to clinical diagnosis and therapy of epilepsy. },

  abstract={ Professional development becomes relevant and effective when teachers are actively involved, collaborate, and when it is linked to teachers’ daily school practice (Hunzicker in Prof Dev Educ 37:177–179, 2011). Preparation of teachers for a curriculum implementation such as the new subject Nature, Life, and Technology can be done by a professional development programme where teachers are actively involved (Visser et al. 2010). This study evaluates the designed and implemented professional development programme with respect to its effectiveness in terms of degree of teacher learning and development. Effects are evaluated for five learning areas: Instructional strategies, differences in students’ prior knowledge, adjustments to the module, assessment methods and instruments, and field trips and guest lectures. Eleven teachers from four different schools participated in two professional development programmes, six teachers in the first professional development programme and five teachers in the programme for the subsequent module. Questionnaires and interviews were used to assess the effects in the different learning areas. The findings show that the professional development programme is a useful venture for teachers’ professional growth in different learning areas. },

  abstract={ The potential for community-led local sustainability initiatives to play a key role in a transition towards a low-carbon economy has been acknowledged by both policymakers and researchers. To date, such initiatives have predominantly been established through the efforts of volunteers, resulting in a scattered uptake across towns, cities and other communities in the UK and further afield. In a context where local and national Government are increasingly seeking to deliver local action on climate change in partnership with community organisations, is it possible or desirable for Government and other publicly funded bodies to successfully set up these grassroots initiatives “from the outside” where none exist already? This paper describes a project which explored this question through the provision of a 2-year programme of support for local action on climate change in a sub-region of the UK. Community development strategies were employed with a view to establishing new grassroots climate change initiatives in a range of different communities. The results indicate some potential for the strategy to meet with success, with several new groups and small-scale projects being established as a result. However, the short lifespan of many of the organisations set up and the relatively low impact on carbon emission reduction of their activities raises questions about the effectiveness of grassroots initiatives and how support of their activities can be delivered most effectively to maximise impact and improve cost effectiveness. },

  abstract={ Computer-assisted language assessment literacy (LAL) has gained momentum in English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching since computer-based education became particularly common in language education. As EFL teachers play a critical role in administering computer-assisted language assessments, Iranian EFL teachers need to learn, relearn, and improve their computer-assisted LAL. Iranian EFL teachers can use collaborative reflection (CR) to improve their computer-assisted LAL and practices. This study, therefore, qualitatively investigated how collaborative reflective practices can improve novice and experienced EFL teachers’ computer-assisted LAL. To achieve the goals of the present study, we adopted an instrumental case study to explore how EFL teachers perceive the benefits, applications, and challenges of computer-assisted language assessment practices and how teachers could improve their computer-assisted LAL through virtual CR. Four novice and experienced EFL teachers were selected purposively to explore internet-based CR through social media, observations, and interviews. The data were qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that computer-assisted language assessment practices enhanced the quality of formative assessment and assessment for learning, authenticity, and meaningfulness of tasks, administration, scoring, and interpretation, among others. Furthermore, EFL teachers experienced various personal, social, educational, and professional advantages of their computer-based language assessment practices through internet-based CR. The pedagogical implications of the study for the development of computer-assisted LAL of EFL in-service language teachers through online reflective practices are discussed. },

A repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated that spelling accuracy for words trained with retrieval practice was higher than for words trained with rainbow writing on both tests (η p 2  = .49). In experiments 2 (second graders, n = 16) and 3 (first graders, n = 12), students completed 2&nbsp;days of spelling practice followed by a spelling test 1&nbsp;day later. Results replicated experiment 1; spelling accuracy was higher for words trained with retrieval practice compared with rainbow writing (η p 2  = .42 and .64, respectively). Furthermore, students endorsed both liking and learning from retrieval practice at least as much as (and sometimes more than) rainbow writing. Results demonstrate that retrieval practice is a more useful (and as engaging) training method than is rainbow writing and extend the well-established testing effect to beginning spellers. },

Population ecology is one biological perspective that has been especially influential within the organization design literature. In the current study, we illustrate for the first time how this framework can be used to reveal when and in what ways intervention is warranted within a system that, like a biological population in nature, has emerged with little to no purposeful design. Specifically, we use 20 years of data on 1,074 Arizona charter schools to illustrate how population analysis can be used to uncover the characteristics of individual organizations that have the highest ability to survive over time within systems that have been allowed to emerge with little to no purposeful design. Our findings lead us to argue how pre-intervention population analysis at the system level can influence organization-level design choices in a way that enables dynamic fit and thereby enhances the likelihood of organization survivorship and innovation over time. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to discover pre-school children's vocabulary learning, retention levels, and perspectives of English language learning using augmented reality (AR) technology. To achieve this goal, a one-group pre-test, and post-test design was used to assess the effect of using AR-supported educational toys on pre-school children's learning of English words/concepts and retention levels. The case study method was used to investigate the children's perspectives of their AR learning experiences. The sample of this study consisted of 39 pre-school children aged between 5-6. Firstly, the word/concept test was conducted as a pre-test. After 4 weeks of implementation, the test was applied as a post-test. Two weeks after the implementations were completed, the same test was conducted again, and the retention level of the children was determined. Then, face-to-face interviews were done with six children within the week after the final tests. Results showed that there was a 72-point increase in their word/concept learning after the implementation. The children dropped 17 points in the retention test after a two-week break following the post-test. It was found that the children correctly answered 93% of the words saying the English versions of the visual and 55% of the words saying the English equivalents of the words. In addition, the children remembered 77% of the English version of the words shown in the visual and 50% of the English equivalents of the words. Qualitative results indicated that children liked AR materials in general and that it had a positive effect on their learning. },

  abstract={ This essay first summarizes an overarching theory of cognitive organization and development. This theory claims that the human mind involves (1) several specialized structural systems dealing with different domains of relations in the environment, (2) a central representational capacity system, (3) general inferential processes, and (4) consciousness. These systems interact dynamically during development so that changes in each are related to changes in others. The changes in all systems and the change mechanisms are described. This theory integrates research and theorizing from cognitive, developmental, and differential psychology. Based on this theory, a model for education is proposed that specifies, first, educational priorities for different phases of development according to the cognitive developmental milestones associated with each phase. The theory also specifies how education can educate students to (1) construct mental models for the sake of conceptual change, (2) use their central representational capacity efficiently, (3) advance analogical and deductive reasoning, (4) learn how to learn, and (5) become critical and creative thinkers. The theory is offered as an overarching paradigm for the architecture, the development, and the education of the human mind. },

Nine female junior high school students living in an urban area of Taiwan were recruited. Five major themes emerged after data analysis: uncomfortable feelings about gender inequality, denial of the importance of beauty, high career aspirations, agreement on the stereotypes of negative female dispositions, and identification with masculine qualities and interests. These themes reflected their mixed sentiment toward gender stereotypes. The social identity approach, social status theory, and optimal distinctiveness theory were employed to explain these young women’s perception of gender stereotypes. Implications for interventions to address inner conflict and for future research were also discussed. },

This study aimed to describe the design and students’ evaluation of a blended “Sports Multimedia Courseware Design” course among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using information communication technologies, a 4-month blended course was developed, which consisted of 36 credits (18-credit online self-learning + 18-credit offline group-learning). A total of 1300 Chinese university students who majored in physical education, completed the blended course from Mar to Jun 2020, among which 238 (69.75% males; 21 ± 1.2&nbsp;years) were randomly recruited to evaluate the course in terms of three aspects: (1) online self-learning, (2) offline group-learning, and (3) overall learning outcomes. A descriptive analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS 27.0. Students’ overall positive evaluation supported a successful development and implementation of the blended course. Over 90% of students fulfilled the learning tasks and satisfied with the online learning resources. About 83% of students indicated high levels of autonomous motivation and engagement in online self-learning. Approximately 88% of students showed positive attitudes to the offline group-learning content, while the participation rate (60%) was relatively lower than of the online self-learning. Over 50% of the students indicated self-improvements in diverse aspects after attending the blended course. Blended online and offline pedagogy shows apparent promise in delivering the PET course among Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further application and comprehensive evaluation are warranted in the future. },

Many frameworks and debates centred on rethinking and reshaping the curriculum including what knowledge, skills, values and attitudes should be taught to prepare learners to thrive in the 21st century, have been developed. This study examined the students’ conceptions of 21st century education in four diverse schools in Zimbabwe. The study is framed by the powerful theory and the complexity theory. The study used a quantitative non-experimental correlation design to collect data from four secondary schools, three of which follow the ZIMSEC syllabus and the other, a private school that follows a Cambridge syllabus. The questionnaire was adapted from the Partnership for 21st century framework (P21) and (Ravitz, 2014) to fit the Zimbabwean context. A total of 236 students and 93 took part. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and ANOVA were used to analyse the data. The results showed that the students’ conception of 21st century skills is defined by three factors: the learning of self-management, learning skills and values and learning process. Students most strongly endorsed self-management. It is envisaged that the proposed model of Zimbabwean students’ conceptions of 21st century skills will act as a baseline for theory, policymakers, head teachers, teachers and teacher education colleges to realign the current teaching to fit the 21st century curricula. },

Attributes related to education for a knowledge society, sustainable development, or 21st century skills are parts of current national educational policies and reforms. A powerful pretext for global educational reform thinking is current international student assessments. As a consequence, particular educational reform orthodoxy has emerged that relies on a set of basic assumptions in order to improve the quality of education and fix other educational deficiencies. This article describes the beginning of the present global educational reform movement discussing some of its key characteristics and implications in practice. Although overlooked by many policy analysts, Finland represents a striking and highly successful alternative to this global educational reform movement. The scholarly work of Andy Hargreaves is seen as essential in understanding the requirements and resources that are needed in securing good public education for all in the future. },

It departs from the rising offer of programmes for school children in out-of-school contexts (e.g. museums, libraries, science centres). It asks what makes these practices educational (and not just interesting, entertaining and/or audience building). Based on Biesta (2006a, 2010) theory of education, the author frames and analyses the educational characteristics of, and possibilities of articulating, in and out-of-school educational practices. This paper aims at understanding if the occasional outing from primary school premises promotes interruptions in the humanist foundations of school. In order to analyse relations between different institutions and professionals (to be) engaged in educational activities and programmes, Nóvoa (2002, 2009) essays will be brought to the discussion, namely his conception of the ‘Public Space of Education’—as a space where culture, education, arts, sports and leisure are shared responsibilities, and where diverse institutions are networked aiming towards societal pluralism. I argue for the possibility of using cities’ public spaces as contexts with a worldly quality to complexify children’s education. Nevertheless, I draw attention to the unbearable educational lightness that these practices may carry if they do not go beyond the praise of chance; as well as to their unsustainable weight if they perpetually repeat school’s normal orders and add up rational discourses. },

National survey data from 11,819 adolescents (mean age, 14.29&nbsp;years; 48&nbsp;% girls) in 200 junior high schools in China were used to examine whether school-level importance of money was associated with self-esteem, and how adolescents’ family income and gender modified this association. Multilevel structure equation modeling analysis indicated that school-level importance of money was significantly and negatively related to individual students’ self-esteem after controlling for school- and individual-level family incomes. The negative effect of school-level average importance of money on self-esteem varied with Chinese adolescents’ subjective, but not objective, family income. Adolescents whose parents subjectively perceived that their families were poorer than others were more vulnerable to the negative effect of school-level average importance of money. No gender difference in susceptibility to the school-level average importance of money was observed. These findings suggest that Chinese adolescents’ self-esteem is contingent on social standards about money. },

Lowered engagement in school has been attributed to factors such as inappropriate teaching strategies, curricula that is unchallenging and irrelevant, and cultural and technological conditions that continue to evolve (Sullivan et al. Australian Journal of Education 53(2):176-191, 2009). There is currently a gap in this field of research in terms of a lack of longitudinal studies conducted in an Australian context that feature students’ voices and their perceptions of mathematics teaching and learning during the middle years. As part of a qualitative longitudinal case study spanning 3 school years, 20 students in their final year of primary school (aged between 11 and 12&nbsp;years) were asked to provide their views on mathematics teaching and learning. The aim of the study was to explore the students’ perspectives of mathematics teaching and learning to discover pedagogies that engage the students. During focus group discussions and individual interviews the students discussed qualities of a “good” mathematics teacher and aspects of “good” lessons. These were found to resonate well with current Australian quality teaching frameworks. The findings of this study indicate that students in the middle years are critically aware of pedagogies that lead to engagement in mathematics, and existing standards and frameworks should be used as a starting point for quality teaching of mathematics. },

  abstract={ Virtual reality (VR) has brought about numerous alternative learning opportunities in the last decade, and with modern products such as Oculus Rift and other wearable Virtual Reality technologies being introduced into society, VR will promisingly continue to provide yet unseen opportunities in the next few decades and therefore is a technology that deserves serious consideration and study. In an attempt to better understand how virtual worlds positively affect student learning, this study used an online 3D VR English language learning platform and conducted an experiment to evaluate the student learning effectiveness based on Bloom’s cognitive complexity level. t test analysis was used to determine the effectiveness of the learning platform, while structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used to determine the learning model behind the pedagogy. Participants were 448 students at a science and technology university in Taiwan. Results show that students improved their phonological, morphological, grammar and syntax knowledge, and virtual world learning assisted in the development of a more complex and higher level of thinking. The SEM analysis results indicated the virtual learning environment with unique features of immersion and ease of use, together with help-seeking positively affected student language cognition. },

  abstract={ In online education, ensuring robust performance and preemptively addressing system vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing user experience and operational efficiency. This study concentrates on developing a dynamic risk warning system for ideological and political education by utilizing LSTM-MLP models for the processing and optimization of online education data. The system encompasses functional modules designed from five distinct aspects: data collection, data analysis, early warning information presentation, intervention and effect evaluation, and system setup. By integrating LSTM for sequence learning and MLP for feature extraction and combining it with the static characteristics of students’ behaviour portraits, the system effectively predicts and manages performance fluctuations and potential risks associated with varying user demands. In a test set including 800 participants, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.9817 and a recall rate of 0.7633, significantly outperforming traditional models. Performance testing under irregular user increments demonstrates that the system maintains satisfactory response times and latency within acceptable thresholds, even under high concurrent loads. This research contributes to the resilience and reliability of online educational platforms, fostering improved user satisfaction and academic outcomes. },

  abstract={ Conceptions of learning and learners underpin and lend legitimacy to curriculum decisions. This study engages with the national early childhood curriculum documents of three countries, Australia, Japan and China in order to understand their conceptions of learning and learners. The lens through which we explore learning and learners is one that privileges curriculum as an important document in which the concepts of learning and learners are understood. The purpose of this cross-national comparison is twofold: it analyses learning and learners in each curriculum document to consider ways in which the concepts are constituted; and it compares the three curricula with regard to their expressions of the concepts in order to identify how national and global contexts influence early childhood curricula. Concept analysis provides an approach with which to explore learning and learners, and consequently a useful way of understanding them across the three documents. While findings highlight some similar articulations of the concepts, significant differences are detected. It is argued that the documents produce distinctive national and global versions of learning and learners. The study is expected to become a catalyst for national and international discussions of key curriculum terms. },

  abstract={ Favourable home learning environments (HLEs) support children’s literacy, numeracy and social development. In large-scale research, HLE is typically measured by self-report survey, but there is little consistency between studies and many different items and latent constructs are observed. Little is known about the stability of these items and constructs over time when used in either longitudinal research or studies with children with a wide range of ages. A review of the literature shows commonalities and differences between approaches in research on HLE. When we tested the psychometric properties of a short-form measure of HLE with a Rasch item-response-model using longitudinal data from over 1600 Australian families, there was support for two dimensions of HLE—formal and informal learning frequency. We found that this measure was stable over the transitional period from pre-K to school as well as between gender and family language background. There were small but significant associations between the HLE measures and cognitive and behavioural developmental outcomes. We recommend that other measures of HLE could be similarly validated to assess their suitability for use in longitudinal research on learning environments. Recommendations are made for the future development of measures of broader constructs of the HLE. },

  abstract={ In keeping with practices elsewhere in Europe, Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in Ireland have in recent decades adopted access policies for non-traditional students (not recent school leavers). This paper assesses a particular initiative to facilitate access to HEIs to non-traditional students. However, due to the initiative's origins as a non-accredited certificate for asylum seekers and refugees, specific attention will be paid to the immigrant community. This paper assesses the details of a new programme in Irish politics and political leadership for non-traditional students in Ireland. It will present the curriculum and document the teaching strategies that were selected while exploring the role for universities and political science departments, in particular in facilitating integration. Student-centred learning provides the overarching framework for the curriculum. Three teaching approaches – KWL, service learning, and enquiry- or problem-based learning – have been selected as the pedagogical underpinnings of this Certificate programme. The paper explores all three approaches and provides examples of how these will be employed. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion of how the programme could be adapted in other jurisdictions and its uses in integrating citizens from new communities across European democracies. },

Teacher education programs play an important role in the development of beliefs regarding teaching and learning. The purpose of the study was to document pre-service teachers’ views on science, scientists, and science teaching as well as the relations between these views and the offered courses over several years spent in an elementary science teacher training program. The sample consisted of 145 pre-service elementary science teachers who were being trained to teach general science to students in the 6th through 8th grades. The research design was a cross-sectional study. Three different instruments were used to collect the data, namely, the “Draw a Scientist Test”, “Draw a Science Teacher Test”, and “Students’ Views about Science” tests. The elementary science teacher training program influenced pre-service science teachers’ views about science, scientists and science teaching to different degrees. The most pronounced impact of the program was on views about science teaching. Participants’ impressions of science teaching changed from teacher-centered views to student-centered ones. In contrast, participants’ views about scientists and science did not change much. This result could be interpreted as indicating that science teacher training programs do not change views about science and scientists but do change beliefs regarding teaching science. },

Twenty-nine students aged between 13 and 16&nbsp;years were selected from three secondary schools in England. Data were collected from initial lesson observations and in-depth interviews in order to explore students’ views about practical work. The findings suggest that students have three main reasons why practical work is important in their school science lessons: for interest and activity, including social and personal features such as participation and autonomy; as an alternative to other forms of science teaching involving a pedagogy of transmission, and as a way of learning, including memorizing and recall. The findings are discussed in the context of a critical view of previous work on the role of practical work, work on attitudes to science and on the student voice. The paper concludes that practical work is seen to provide opportunities for students to engage with and influence their own learning but that learning with practical work remains a complex issue that needs further research and evaluation about its use, effectiveness and of the role of scientific inquiry as a component of practical activity. },

  abstract={ The ‘Be the Best You Can Be’ (BtBYCB) program is a school-based intervention designed to foster positive physical, psychological, and social development via empowering young people to take ownership over their own personal development. The aim of this work is to determine the effectiveness of the BtBYCB program on (i) pupils’ well-being, self-perceptions, self-esteem, aspirations, and learning strategies; and (ii) changes in modifiable health-risk behaviors (i.e., physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption). A two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial employing a wait-list control plus qualitative and mixed-method evaluations was used. Participants were school pupils from Years 7 and 8 (aged 11–13 years). Ten schools located in southwest England were randomly allocated to receive the BtBYCB intervention (n = 5 schools; 711 pupils) or a control condition (i.e., usual Personal, Social, and Health Education classes) (n = 5 schools; 622 pupils). Participants in the intervention condition received a program consisting of (i) a talk from an Olympian/Paralympian; (ii) 11 one-hour teacher-led PSHE classroom sessions in which pupils identified their aspirations, values, and interests and explored and acted on these via activities such as personal development planning, goal-setting, and peer-mentoring; and (iii) participated in a celebration event (e.g., second visit from Olympian/Paralympian and short individual presentations). Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Focus groups (pupils and teachers) and individual interviews (headteachers) were conducted in the 5 intervention schools to (i) gain an in-depth understanding of mechanisms of change; (ii) explore ways in which the participants’ motivation and engagement could be enhanced, and (iii) elicit user-feedback pertaining to how the program, content, and appeal could be improved. A mixed-method approach was used to describe and explain the differing experiences of particular groupings within and across the intervention schools; i.e., those for whom the program was effective, those that experienced little, if any change, and those for whom the program led to an inverse effect. The findings of this work will provide insight into the effectiveness of an innovative and child-centered program. The research will inform improvements to the BtBYCB program as well as other interventions targeting child/youth health and wellness. The trial is registered as Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN99443695 . },

I consider the articles thematically in relation to a suggested set of important or pressing questions about creativity and giftedness in mathematics education, grouped into four areas: (1) definitions and meanings, (2) learning environments, (3) teacher preparation, (4) educational policies and societal trends. The first three of these areas are addressed most specifically; the latter is given less attention, with much remaining to be researched. In the context of the topics most addressed, possible emphases in studying mathematical creativity and giftedness include cognitive, affective, conative (motivational), social, and behavioral aspects. The studies here focus mostly on the cognitive, social, and behavioral dimensions. I highlight some specific findings, offer comments, and suggest the need for greater future emphasis on affective and motivational variables. My response concludes with consideration of the value of prioritizing mathematical creativity and giftedness (or high ability), noting some troubling policy directions and societal trends that should be taken into serious account and studied. },

  abstract={ Laypeople’s participation in the planning of built environments is dependent on their spatial literacy, and it is therefore important to develop this through general education. In Norway, architectural assignments in the subject of Art and crafts are aimed at enhancing spatial literacy, but not all activities are equally educative. The use of Virtual Reality (VR) can contribute to students’ understanding of and engagement with spatial properties, but few studies have been conducted at the lower secondary school level. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore how pupils in a Norwegian lower secondary school reflect upon and use floor plan drawings, digital 3D models, and VR in architectural assignments aiming to support their spatial literacy. Although VR has the potential to facilitate activities that support the pupils’ spatial literacy, the pupils in this study tended to use VR to a lesser extent, mostly towards the end of their projects. We suggest that the finished look of the VR visualisations, conceptualised herein as ‘perceived finishedness’, may have contributed to this. This highlights the use of VR as a visualisation tool rather than a design process tool. },

Detailed descriptions of levels of achievement for each year of schooling are being ascribed the dual role of measuring the effectiveness of school systems and helping teachers to ensure all students are supported to gain common outcomes. The use of standards to inform teaching and learning has developed from research on differentiation practices and is associated with specific pedagogies designed to support students at risk of not succeeding in schooling. This project aimed to investigate the extent to which the ideas and practices associated with standards-based curriculum reform are currently influencing teachers’ thinking and practice in three Victorian primary schools situated in low socio-economic status contexts. Teachers’ beliefs and practices associated with supporting students from backgrounds traditionally linked with low achievement were collected before and after trialling units of work designed by pre-service teachers. The results reveal that the ideas and strategies currently used by teachers in three schools largely conflict with the pedagogies associated with standards-based reform and the findings question the extent to which current national agendas in Australia will influence classroom practices and student outcomes. },

Video games could contribute to the assessment and management of ADHD, but there are no previous reviews on this topic. Here, we systematically review the evidence about video game-based assessment tools and interventions for children diagnosed with ADHD. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO database. We searched four databases—PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase and clinicaltrials.gov—to identify original studies exploring either video game-based interventions or video game-based assessment tools in children with ADHD. After initial screening, full text revision and study selection, 22 articles were finally included in the review. Most studies used PC as platform, with a minority using a video console, pad, or 3D device. Video game-based assessment tools were generally effective in discriminating ADHD cases from controls, and in discriminating between ADHD subtypes. Video game-based therapeutic interventions were well accepted and generally effective in improving cognitive areas and decreasing ADHD symptoms. Gamification and cognitive training could be the main mechanisms underlying the usefulness and effectiveness of video game-based assessment tools and interventions. Software optimization and greater collaboration between developers and healthcare professionals are some of the priorities for future research in this area. },

Psychological Research, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1006-7 , 2018). Here, we expanded these findings by additionally examining the role of learners’ control in short-term task-switching training by comparing voluntary task-switching to a yoked control forced task-switching condition. To this end, four training conditions were compared: (1) forced fixed content, (2) voluntary fixed content, (3) forced varied content, and (3) voluntary varied content. To further enhance task demands, bivalent stimuli were used during training. Participants completed baseline assessment commencing with task-switching and verbal fluency blocks, followed by seven training blocks and last by task-switching (near transfer) and verbal fluency (far transfer) blocks, respectively. For the baseline and transfer task-switching blocks, we used the exact same baseline and first transfer block from Sabah et al. (Psychological Research, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1006-7 , 2018), employing univalent stimuli and alternating-runs task sequence. Our results pointed again to the contribution of content variability to task-switching performance. No indications for far transfer were observed. Allowing for learners’ control was not found to produce additional transfer gains beyond content variability. A between-study comparison suggests that enhanced task demands, by means of bivalency, promoted higher transfer gains in the current study when compared to Sabah et al. (Psychological Research, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1006-7 , 2018). Taken together, the current results provide further evidence to the beneficial impact of variability on training outcomes. The lack of modulatory effect for learners’ control is discussed in relation to possible methodological limitations. },

  abstract={ Tumour biopsy for pharmacodynamic (PD) study is increasingly common in early-phase cancer trials. As they are non-diagnostic, the ethical justification for such procedures rests on their knowledge value. On the premise that knowledge value is related to reporting practices and outcome diversity, we assessed in a sample of recent invasive PD studies within cancer trials. We assessed reporting practices and outcomes for PD studies in a convenience sample of cancer trials published from 2000 to 2010 that employed invasive, non-diagnostic tissue procurement. Extracted data were used to measure outcome reporting in individual trials. Using a reporting scale we developed for exploratory purposes, we tested whether reporting varied with study characteristics, such as funding source or drug novelty. Reporting varied widely within and across studies. Some practices were sporadically reported, including results of all planned tests (78% trials reporting), use of blinded histopathological assessment (43% trials reporting), biopsy dimensions (38% trials reporting), and description of patient flow through PD analysis (62%). Pharmacodynamic analysis as a primary end point and mandatory biopsy had statistically significant positive relationships with overall quality of reporting. A preponderance of positive results (61% of the studies described positive PD results) suggests possible publication bias. Our results highlight the need for PD-reporting guidelines, and suggest several avenues for improving the risk/benefit for studies involving invasive, non-diagnostic tissue procurement. },

  abstract={ Developmental scientists have long described mid-adolescents’ emerging capacities to make deep meaning about the social world and self, here called transcendent thinking, as a hallmark developmental stage. In this 5-years longitudinal study, sixty-five 14–18&nbsp;years-old youths’ proclivities to grapple psychologically with the ethical, systems-level and personal implications of social stories, predicted future increases in the coordination of two key brain networks: the default-mode network, involved in reflective, autobiographical and free-form thinking, and the executive control network, involved in effortful, focused thinking; findings were independent of IQ, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background. This neural development predicted late-adolescent identity development, which predicted young-adult self-liking and relationship satisfaction, in a developmental cascade. The findings reveal a novel predictor of mid-adolescents’ neural development, and suggest the importance of attending to adolescents’ proclivities to engage agentically with complex perspectives and emotions on the social and personal relevance of issues, such as through civically minded educational approaches. },

  abstract={ How do we learn about what to learn about? Specifically, how do the neural elements in our brain generalize what has been learned in one situation to recognize the common structure of—and speed learning in—other, similar situations? We know this happens because we become better at solving new problems—learning and deploying schemas1–5—through experience. However, we have little insight into this process. Here we show that using prior knowledge to facilitate learning is accompanied by the evolution of a neural schema in the orbitofrontal cortex. Single units were recorded from rats deploying a schema to learn a succession of odour-sequence problems. With learning, orbitofrontal cortex ensembles converged onto a low-dimensional neural code across both problems and subjects; this neural code represented the common structure of the problems and its evolution accelerated across their learning. These results demonstrate the formation and use of a schema in a prefrontal brain region to support a complex cognitive operation. Our results not only reveal a role for the orbitofrontal cortex in learning but also have implications for using ensemble analyses to tap into complex cognitive functions. Rats learning to solve a succession of odour-sequence problems developed an orbitofrontal cortical representation that reflected the structure—or schema—common across problems. },

  abstract={ There is a widespread belief that information technologies will improve diagnosis, treatment and care. Evidence about their effectiveness in health care is, however, mixed. It is not clear why this is the case, given the remarkable advances in hardware and software over the last 20 years. This review focuses on interoperable information technologies, which governments are currently advocating and funding. These link organisations across a health economy, with a view to enabling health and care professionals to coordinate their work with one another and to access patient data wherever it is stored. Given the mixed evidence about information technologies in general, and current policies and funding, there is a need to establish the value of investments in this class of system. The aim of this review is to establish how, why and in what circumstances interoperable systems affect patient safety. A realist synthesis will be undertaken, to understand how and why inter-organisational systems reduce patients’ clinical risks, or fail to do so. The review will follow the steps in most published realist syntheses, including (1) clarifying the scope of the review and identifying candidate programme and mid-range theories to evaluate, (2) searching for evidence, (3) appraising primary studies in terms of their rigour and relevance and extracting evidence, (4) synthesising evidence, (5) identifying recommendations, based on assessment of the extent to which findings can be generalised to other settings. The findings of this realist synthesis will shed light on how and why an important class of systems, that span organisations in a health economy, will contribute to changes in patients’ clinical risks. We anticipate that the findings will be generalizable, in two ways. First, a refined mid-range theory will contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that, for a range of information technologies, lead to changes in clinical practices and hence patients’ risks (or not). Second, many governments are funding and implementing cross-organisational IT networks. The findings can inform policies on their design and implementation. PROSPERO CRD42017073004 },

  abstract={ As mosquitoes are one of the most harmful creatures in the world, recent high-frequency interceptions of invasive mosquito species have emphasized the need to enhance the biological security of the Zhejiang Province in China. As such, an integrated management system should be implemented to monitor the vectors of mosquito-borne diseases during data digitization and the processing of permanent E-forms and provide an online one-stop identification service. This system is a semi-open network built on the latest Microsoft.NET Framework, Active Server Page.NET (ASP.NET) and Internet Information Services (IIS) for the Windows 2000 service as a basic infrastructure platform. This creates a physical separation between the data input as the back-page intranet and the online automated Lucid identification as the front-page internet through the digital interchange platform and security firewall. This system mainly comprises three core modules: automated statistical analysis of operational data, online vector identification and digital specimen storage management, in addition to accessory modules. The joint analysis of invasive and native data collected between 2011 and 2017 at 14 surveillance points in the Zhejiang Province, excluding Ningbo Port, provided insights into the geographical differences in species abundance and the dynamic nature of seasonal interception within the statistical analysis module. Most importantly, multi-access keys to mosquitoes based on Lucid software were loaded in the module for vector identification. Subscribers can utilize this procedure for the online identification of 2 subfamilies, 10 genera and 33 mosquitoes by selecting any typical morphological feature in the classification system that matches the current images at hand. Our report suggests that this system can enhance the ability to master the basic information on invasive mosquitoes and satisfy the increasing requirements for public health safety in the integrated management of vector-borne diseases. },

  abstract={ Congenital hand deformities (CHD) have attracted increasing research attention in the past few decades. The impacts of CHD on the brain structure, however, are not fully studied to date. In this work, we propose a novel framework to study brain morphometry in CHD patients using Wasserstein distance based on optimal mass transport (OMT) theory. We first employ conformal mapping to map the left and right surface-based functional brain areas to planar rectangles, which pushes the area element on the brain surface to the planar rectangle and incurs the area distortion. A measure is then determined by this area distortion. We further propose a new rectangle domain-based OMT map algorithm. Given two measures on two surfaces, we employ the proposed algorithm to compute a unique OMT map between the two measures encoding the geometric information of left and right surface-based functional brain areas. The transportation cost of this OMT map gives the Wasserstein distance between two surfaces, which intrinsically measures the dissimilarities between two surface-based shapes. Our method is theoretically rigorous and computationally efficient and stable. We finally evaluate the proposed Wasserstein distance-based method on the left and right post-central gyri from the CHD patients and healthy control subjects for analyzing brain cortical morphometry. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method, and shed insightful lights on the study of the brain morphometry for those subjects with CHD. },

  abstract={ We use mental models of the world—cognitive maps—to guide behavior. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) is typically thought to support behavior by deploying these maps to simulate outcomes, but recent evidence suggests that it may instead support behavior by underlying map creation. We tested between these two alternatives using outcome-specific devaluation and a high-potency chemogenetic approach. Selectively inactivating lOFC principal neurons when male rats learned distinct cue–outcome associations, but before outcome devaluation, disrupted subsequent inference, confirming a role for the lOFC in creating new maps. However, lOFC inactivation surprisingly led to generalized devaluation, a result that is inconsistent with a complete mapping failure. Using a reinforcement learning framework, we show that this effect is best explained by a circumscribed deficit in credit assignment precision during map construction, suggesting that the lOFC has a selective role in defining the specificity of associations that comprise cognitive maps. Animals form cognitive maps of the world to guide behavior. This study shows that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex is essential for creating precise, outcome-specific cognitive maps during initial learning, but not for general map creation in itself. },

  abstract={ The spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the long-standing health inequalities across the U.S. as neighborhoods with fewer resources were associated with higher rates of COVID-19 transmission. Although the stay-at-home order was one of the most effective methods to contain its spread, residents in lower-income neighborhoods faced barriers to practicing social distancing. We aimed to quantify the differential impact of stay-at-home policy on COVID-19 transmission and residents’ mobility across neighborhoods of different levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. This was a comparative interrupted time-series analysis at the county level. We included 2087 counties from 38 states which both implemented and lifted the state-wide stay-at-home order. Every county was assigned to one of four equally-sized groups based on its levels of disadvantage, represented by the Area Deprivation Index. Prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the daily number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases by the number of residents from the 2010 Census. We used the Social Distancing Index (SDI), derived from the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, to measure the mobility. For the evaluation of implementation, the observation started from Mar 1st 2020 to 1 day before lifting; and, for lifting, it ranged from 1 day after implementation to Jul 5th 2020. We calculated a comparative change of daily trends in COVID-19 prevalence and Social Distancing Index between counties with three highest disadvantage levels and those with the least level before and after the implementation and lifting of the stay-at-home order, separately. On both stay-at-home implementation and lifting dates, COVID-19 prevalence was much higher among counties with the highest or lowest disadvantage level, while mobility decreased as the disadvantage level increased. Mobility of the most disadvantaged counties was least impacted by stay-at-home implementation and relaxation compared to counties with the most resources; however, disadvantaged counties experienced the largest relative increase in COVID-19 infection after both stay-at-home implementation and relaxation. Neighborhoods with varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage reacted differently to the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Policymakers should consider investing more resources in disadvantaged counties as the pandemic may not stop until most neighborhoods have it under control. },

  abstract={ Heart failure affects 26 million people globally, and the optimal management of medicines is crucial for patients, particularly when their care is transferred between hospital and the community. Optimising clinical outcomes requires well-calibrated cross-organisational processes with staff and patients responding and adapting to medicines changes. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing a complex intervention (the Medicines at Transitions Intervention; MaTI) co-designed by patients and healthcare staff. The purpose of the intervention was to optimise medicines management across the gaps between secondary and primary care when hospitals handover care. The study objectives were to (1) assess feasibility through meeting specified progression criteria to proceed to the trial, (2) assess if the intervention was acceptable to staff and patients, and (3) determine whether amendment or refinement would be needed to enhance the MaTI. The feasibility of the MaTI was tested in three healthcare areas in the North of England between July and October 2017. Feasibility was measured and assessed through four agreed progression to trial criteria: (1) patient recruitment, (2) patient receipt of a medicines toolkit, (3) transfer of discharge information to community pharmacy, and (4) offer of a community pharmacy medicines review/discussion or medicines reconciliation. From the cardiology wards at each of the three NHS Acute Trusts (sites), 10 patients (aged ≥ 18 years) were recruited and introduced to the ‘My Medicines Toolkit’ (MMT). Patients were asked to identify their usual community pharmacy or nominate a pharmacy. Discharge information was transferred to the community pharmacy; pharmacists were asked to reconcile medicines and invited patients for a medicines use review (MUR) or discussion. At 1 month following discharge, all patients were sent three questionnaire sets: quality-of-life, healthcare utilisation, and a patient experience survey. In a purposive sample, 20 patients were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview about their experiences of the MaTI. Staff from hospital and primary care settings involved in patients’ care were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Patient and staff interviews were analysed using Framework Analysis. Questionnaire completion rates were recorded and data were descriptively analysed. Thirty-one patients were recruited across three sites. Eighteen staff and 18 patients took part in interviews, and 19 patients returned questionnaire sets. All four progression to trial criteria were met. We identified barriers to patient engagement with the intervention in hospital, which were compounded by patients’ focus on returning home. Some patients described not engaging in discussions with staff about medicines and lacking motivation to do so because they were preoccupied with returning home. Some patients were unable or unwilling to attend a community pharmacy in person for a medicines review. Roles and responsibilities for delivering the MaTI were different in the three sites, and staff reported variations in time spent on MaTI activities. Staff reported some work pressures and staff absences that limited the time they could spend talking to patients about their medicines. Clinical teams reported that recording a target dose for heart failure medicines in patient-held documentation was difficult as they did not always know the ideal or tolerable dose. The majority of patients reported receiving the patient-held documentation. More than two-thirds reported being offered a MUR by their community pharmacists. Delivery of the Medicines at Transitions Intervention (MaTI) was feasible at all three sites, and progression to trial criteria were met. Refinements were found to be necessary to overcome identified barriers and strengthen delivery of all steps of the intervention. Necessary changes to the MaTI were identified along with amendments to the implementation plan for the subsequent trial. Future implementation needs to take into account the complexity of medicines management and adaptation to local context. },

The spatial dimension of this multifunctionality remains to be formalised to increase effectiveness of nature-based solutions. We aimed to systematically analyse effects of fragmentation on multifunctionality and their interactions with land-use intensity responses. We generated virtual landscapes to model interactions among six ecosystem services (ES) of different spatial sensitivities. We simulated land-use patterns on topographies from plains to mountains. Four land-use intensity treatments departed from hypothesised optimal composition for biodiversity and ES with &gt; 30% intensive, &lt; 30% extensive or protected and &gt; 40% intermediate intensity use. For each composition we generated landscapes with differing fragmentation. Pixel- and landscape-level multifunctionality emerge from sensitivities of the six ES to landscape composition, fragmentation and their interactions. In heterogeneous landscapes of intermediate land-use intensity extensive grasslands and spatial complementarity supported multiple ES provision. Increasing land use intensity decreased multifunctionality by reducing all ES. However, greater fragmentation mitigated some of these effects because its benefits to nitrogen retention and pollination exceeded losses for recreation, especially in finer-grained landscapes. The five regulating ES were synergistic and showed trade-offs with recreation. Although interactions were most sensitive to intensity given its dominant effects on individual ES, fragmentation mediated interaction strength. Virtual simulations allow a systematic understanding of how interactions between land-use intensity and fragmentation modulate multifunctionality. This constitutes an essential step to designing templates for climate smart-landscapes tailored to regional geographies, land-use allocation and ES priorities. },

  abstract={ Robotic surgery offers many potential benefits for patients. While an increasing number of healthcare providers are purchasing surgical robots, there are reports that the technology is failing to be introduced into routine practice. Additionally, in robotic surgery, the surgeon is physically separated from the patient and the rest of the team, with the potential to negatively impact teamwork in the operating theatre. The aim of this study is to ascertain: how and under what circumstances robotic surgery is effectively introduced into routine practice; and how and under what circumstances robotic surgery impacts teamwork, communication and decision making, and subsequent patient outcomes. We will undertake a process evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial comparing laparoscopic and robotic surgery for the curative treatment of rectal cancer. Realist evaluation provides an overall framework for the study. The study will be in three phases. In Phase I, grey literature will be reviewed to identify stakeholders’ theories concerning how robotic surgery becomes embedded into surgical practice and its impacts. These theories will be refined and added to through interviews conducted across English hospitals that are using robotic surgery for rectal cancer resection with staff at different levels of the organisation, along with a review of documentation associated with the introduction of robotic surgery. In Phase II, a multi-site case study will be conducted across four English hospitals to test and refine the candidate theories. Data will be collected using multiple methods: the structured observation tool OTAS (Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery); video recordings of operations; ethnographic observation; and interviews. In Phase III, interviews will be conducted at the four case sites with staff representing a range of surgical disciplines, to assess the extent to which the results of Phase II are generalisable and to refine the resulting theories to reflect the experience of a broader range of surgical disciplines. The study will provide (i) guidance to healthcare organisations on factors likely to facilitate successful implementation and integration of robotic surgery, and (ii) guidance on how to ensure effective communication and teamwork when undertaking robotic surgery. },

  abstract={ Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the gold standard for oncologic resection in low and mid rectal cancers. However, abdominal approaches to TME can be hampered by poor visibility, inadequate retraction, and distal margin delineation. Transanal TME (taTME) is a promising hybrid technique that was developed to mitigate the difficulties of operating in the low pelvis and to optimize the circumferential resection and distal margins. The objective of this study was to characterize our experience implementing taTME at our institution in a technically challenging patient population. We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent taTMEs between November 2013 and May 2019 for rectal cancer at a tertiary community cancer center. Outcome measures included pathologic grading of TME specimen, post-operative complications, and oncologic outcomes. Forty-four patients with mid and low rectal cancer underwent low anterior resection via taTME. The most common staging modality was rectal MRI which demonstrated T3 or T4 tumors in 89% of our patients prior to neoadjuvant. Eighty-six percent of patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The initial cases were performed sequentially as a single team, but we later transitioned to a synchronous, two-team approach. Ninety-one percent of TME grades were complete or near complete. Only one patient (2.3%) had a positive circumferential margin. Six patients developed anastomotic leaks with an overall anastomotic complication rate of 18.2%. Two patients (4.5%) with primary rectal cancer developed local recurrence, one of which developed multifocal local recurrence. Using the taTME approach on selected locally advanced low rectal cancers, especially in technically complex irradiated and obese male patients, has yielded comparably safe and effective outcomes to laparoscopic proctectomy. },

  abstract={ Population recovery is difficult for species that require large contiguous areas of habitat, particularly within areas of heterogeneous land ownerships. Ecologically, potential for recovery success requires assessment of quantity, quality, and distribution of available habitat. Our objective was to evaluate habitat for a possible Louisiana black bear recovery in southeastern Texas. First, we categorized land cover and identified remote areas of highly suitable habitat. Next, we used the individual based simulation model J-walk to estimate ability of female black bears to move among remote habitat patches. Then, we applied graph theory to J-walk output to evaluate overall connectivity of remote habitat. An estimated 225,626&nbsp;ha of remote habitat were identified in 901 patches, most of which was located within the eastern half of the study area. Network analysis showed specific areas where targeted conservation efforts may help black bear population expansion throughout the study region. Ultimately, enough habitat area exists to sustain a black bear population and it is best connected among public and private lands largely within the eastern half of the study area. Habitat evaluation will need to be revisited if black bears establish themselves locally and actual habitat use data become available. Regardless, our analysis demonstrates an important first step that may be incorporated into a larger adaptive management framework, updated, and replicated as more-detailed habitat suitability and land use data are available. },

Similar studies assessing the heterogeneous distribution of metals at small-arms ranges (SAR) are lacking. To address this we evaluated whether grab sampling provides appropriate data for performing risk analysis at metal-contaminated SARs characterized with 30–48 grab samples. We evaluated the extractable metal content of Cu, Pb, Sb, and Zn of the field data using a Monte Carlo random resampling with replacement (bootstrapping) simulation approach. Results indicate the 95% confidence interval of the mean for Pb (432&nbsp;mg/kg) at one site was 200–700&nbsp;mg/kg with a data range of 5–4500&nbsp;mg/kg. Considering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency screening level for lead is 400&nbsp;mg/kg, the necessity of cleanup at this site is unclear. Resampling based on populations of 7 and 15 samples, a sample size more realistic for the area yielded high false negative rates. },

  abstract={ In situ sediment treatment technologies can be more economical alternatives than dredging and ex situ treatment; however, their development and application had been hindered due to uncertainties associated with the homogeneity of amendment delivery and mixing and the concern of contaminated sediment resuspension and amendment release into the water column. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the subaqueous amendment delivery and mixing efficiency of a novel pilot scale in situ sediment remediation system addressing these concerns. The in situ sediment treatment system consisted of a hydraulically operated steel casing that provided contained conditions for amendment delivery and mixing to occur and the mixing tool housed by this casing. The mixing tool consisted of a hollow vertical shaft with horizontal mixing blades. The device was capable of delivering amendments to subaqueous sediments during continuous mixing in the downward or upward vertical direction. Activated carbon was used as a tracer to evaluate the efficiency of reagent delivery and mixing. The delivery and mixing system operation was defined by the following parameters: mixing speed, vertical descent or ascent speed, mixing time, total processing time, sediment mixing depth, activated carbon slurry injection volume, pumping flow rate for activated carbon, and pumping pressure for activated carbon. Better amendment yield recoveries were observed at lower added activated carbon volumes, at higher mixing speeds, at lower pump flow rates, in case of thicker mixed sediment zones, and at horizontal locations closer to the center shaft. In general, poor amendment recoveries could be attributed to the limited capacity of the sediment pore space to accommodate the activated carbon slurry. Better recoveries close to the shaft might have occurred due to the fact that the amendment delivery pressure was not controlled and therefore was not constant through each reagent delivery port. The reagent stayed within the enclosure of the device, indicating that contained mixing conditions were achieved. The majority of the suspended sediment settled out fairly quickly from the overlying water column within the enclosure. The in situ remediation system showed potential in terms of successful amendment delivery and mixing into subaqueous sediments. Lower doses of activated carbon were mixed in more efficiently due to the limited availability of pore capacity and issues with powdered activated carbon retention in the sediment. The demonstration took place in sediments with large sand and gravel fractions; sediments containing larger silt and clay fractions are likely to behave differently in terms of sediment resuspension. },

  abstract={ Walkability has been linked to quality of life in many ways. Health related benefits of physical exercise, the accessibility and access benefits of being able to walk to obtain some of your daily needs, or the mental health and social benefits of reduced isolation are a few of the many positive impacts on quality of life that can result from a walkable neighborhood. In the age of increasing energy costs and climate considerations, the ability to walk to important locations is a key component of sustainable communities. While the health and environmental implications of walkable communities are being extensively studied, the social benefits have not been investigated as broadly. Social capital is a measure of an individual’s or group’s networks, personal connections, and involvement. Like economic and human capital, social capital is considered to have important values to both individuals and communities. Through a case study approach this article argues that the generation and maintenance of social capital is another important component of quality of life that may be facilitated by living in a walkable community. Residents living in neighborhoods of varying built form and thus varying levels of walkability in three communities in New Hampshire were surveyed about their levels of social capital and travel behaviors. Comparisons between the more walkable and less walkable neighborhoods show that levels of social capital are higher in more walkable neighborhoods. },

  abstract={ Shifting the resource base for chemical and energy production from fossil feed stocks to renewable raw materials is seen by many as one of the key strategies towards sustainable development. The objective of this study is to assess the environmental burdens of producing polyitaconic acid (PIA), a water-soluble polymer derived from itaconic acid identified by the US Department of Energy as one of the top 12 value added chemicals from northeast (NE) US softwood biomass. Results are compared to corn-derived PIA and fossil-based poly acrylic acid (PAA) on the basis of 1&nbsp;kg of polymer at the factory gate. This study uses attributional life cycle assessment to quantify global warming potential (GWP), fossil energy demand (CED), acidification, eutrophication, water use, and land occupation of the polymer production routes. This includes feedstock growth and harvest, sugar extraction, fermentation, itaconic acid recovery, and subsequent polymerization. Foreground data for softwood-derived PIA comes from lab- and pilot plant runs undertaken by Itaconix LLC. Results indicate that the use of softwood-based PIA may be advantageous in terms of GWP, CED, and acidification when compared to both, the integrated corn biorefinery and fossil-based PAA production. When looking at impacts to eutrophication and water use, the use of softwood leads to lower potential impacts compared to its corn-based counterpart but to higher impacts when compared to fossil-based PAA. Land occupation, to a large extent, due to lower yields and longer growth cycles associated with softwood growth in the NE, is highest for softwood-derived PIA and lowest for fossil-based PAA. Environmental impacts are mainly the results of onsite electricity use, inputs of activated carbon and sodium hydroxide, as well as water use during sugar extraction and fermentation. Assumptions with regards to allocation, activated carbon inputs, and electricity mixes to processes of the foreground system are tested in a sensitivity analysis. Wood-derived PIA production may be an interesting alternative to current fossil-based pathways and could contribute to a future biobased economy. However, currently, land occupation, water use, and eutrophication are high when compared to traditional PAA production. The use of short rotation crops or waste feedstocks and optimization with regards to water requirements and reuse should be investigated to further lower system-wide impacts. },

The Incremental Sampling Methodology (ISM) has been successful for characterization of energetic contamination in soils, but no published ISM processing studies for soils with small arms range metals such as Pb, Cu, Sb, and Zn exists. This study evaluated several ISM sample-processing steps: (1) field splitting to reduce the sample mass shipped to the analytical laboratory, (2) necessity of milling, and (3) processing a larger subsample mass for digestion in lieu of milling. Cone-and-quartering and rotary sectorial splitting techniques yielded poor precision and positively skewed distributions. Hence, an increase in digestion mass from 2 to 10&nbsp;g was evaluated with milled and unmilled samples. Unmilled samples yielded results with the largest variability regardless of aliquot mass. },

The concentration and flux of major ions, carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and trace metals in the heavily urbanized Bagmati River within Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, are reported. The concentrations of all chemical species increased with distance downstream with the exceptions of protons and nitrate, and showed strong relationships with population density adjacent to the river. Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dominated by NH4, was found in high concentrations along the Bagmati drainage system. The export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and TDN were 23 and 33&nbsp;tons km−2 year−1, respectively, at the outlet point of the Kathmandu Valley, much higher than in relatively undeveloped watersheds. The cationic and silica fluxes were 106 and 18&nbsp;tons km−2 year−1 at the outlet of the Bagmati within Kathmandu Valley, and 36 and 32&nbsp;tons km−2 year−1 from the relatively pristine headwater area. The difference between headwaters and the urban site suggests that the apparent weathering flux is three times higher than the actual weathering rate in the heavily urbanized Bagmati basin. Fluxes of cations and silica are above the world average, as well as fluxes from densely populated North American and European watersheds. End-member composition of anthropogenic sources like sewage or agricultural runoff is needed to understand the drivers of this high rate of apparent weathering. },

The extreme outliers strongly influenced the grab sample means for the primary contaminants lead (Pb) and antinomy (Sb). In contrast, median and mean metal concentrations were similar for the ISM samples. ISM significantly reduced measurement uncertainty of estimates of the mean, increasing data quality (e.g., for environmental risk assessments) with fewer samples (e.g., decreasing total project costs). Based on Monte Carlo resampling simulations, grab sampling resulted in highly variable means and upper confidence limits of the mean relative to ISM. },

  abstract={ A wide range of molecules acting as apoptotic cell-associated ligands, phagocyte-associated receptors or soluble bridging molecules have been implicated within the complex sequential processes that result in phagocytosis and degradation of apoptotic cells. Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3, also known as CD50), a human leukocyte-restricted immunoglobulin super-family (IgSF) member, has previously been implicated in apoptotic cell clearance, although its precise role in the clearance process is ill defined. The main objective of this work is to further characterise the function of ICAM-3 in the removal of apoptotic cells. Using a range of novel anti-ICAM-3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including one (MA4) that blocks apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages, alongside apoptotic human leukocytes that are normal or deficient for ICAM-3, we demonstrate that ICAM-3 promotes a domain 1–2-dependent tethering interaction with phagocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate an apoptosis-associated reduction in ICAM-3 that results from release of ICAM-3 within microparticles that potently attract macrophages to apoptotic cells. Taken together, these data suggest that apoptotic cell-derived microparticles bearing ICAM-3 promote macrophage chemoattraction to sites of leukocyte cell death and that ICAM-3 mediates subsequent cell corpse tethering to macrophages. The defined function of ICAM-3 in these processes and profound defect in chemotaxis noted to ICAM-3-deficient microparticles suggest that ICAM-3 may be an important adhesion molecule involved in chemotaxis to apoptotic human leukocytes. },

Since membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are highly dynamic and regulated by ligands or other perturbations, NMR methods are potentially well suited to answer basic functional questions (such as addressing the biophysical basis of ligand efficacy) as well as guiding applications (such as novel ligand design). However, such studies on eukaryotic membrane proteins have often been limited by the inability to incorporate optimal isotopic labels for NMR methods developed for large protein/lipid complexes, including methyl TROSY. We review the different expression systems for production of isotopically labeled membrane proteins and highlight the use of the yeast Pichia pastoris to achieve perdeuteration and 13C methyl probe incorporation within isoleucine sidechains. We further illustrate the use of this method for labeling of several biomedically significant GPCRs. },

A variant of the LOV domain–containing EL222 protein displays responsive blue light–gated transcriptional control of genes in zebrafish and in mammalian cell lines. Optogenetic gene expression systems can control transcription with spatial and temporal detail unequaled with traditional inducible promoter systems. However, current eukaryotic light-gated transcription systems are limited by toxicity, dynamic range or slow activation and deactivation. Here we present an optogenetic gene expression system that addresses these shortcomings and demonstrate its broad utility. Our approach uses an engineered version of EL222, a bacterial light-oxygen-voltage protein that binds DNA when illuminated with blue light. The system has a large (&gt;100-fold) dynamic range of protein expression, rapid activation (&lt;10 s) and deactivation kinetics (&lt;50 s) and a highly linear response to light. With this system, we achieve light-gated transcription in several mammalian cell lines and intact zebrafish embryos with minimal basal gene activation and toxicity. Our approach provides a powerful new tool for optogenetic control of gene expression in space and time. },

  abstract={ Bacterial Type III Secretion Systems deliver effectors into host cells to manipulate cellular processes to the advantage of the pathogen. Many host targets of these effectors are found on membranes. Therefore, to identify their targets, effectors often use specialized membrane-localization domains to localize to appropriate host membranes. However, the molecular mechanisms used by many domains are unknown. Here we identify a conserved bacterial phosphoinositide-binding domain (BPD) that is found in functionally diverse Type III effectors of both plant and animal pathogens. We show that members of the BPD family functionally bind phosphoinositides and mediate localization to host membranes. Moreover, NMR studies reveal that the BPD of the newly identified Vibrio parahaemolyticus Type III effector VopR is unfolded in solution, but folds into a specific structure upon binding its ligand phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate. Thus, our findings suggest a possible mechanism for promoting refolding of Type III effectors after delivery into host cells. Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use the type III secretion system to translocate effectors into the host cell. Here, the authors characterize a bacterial phosphoinositide-binding domain, which is conserved in diverse type III effectors of both plant and animal pathogens and couples membrane localization with refolding. },

  abstract={ The HIF-2 antagonist PT2399 is tested in mice bearing tumourgrafts derived from human renal cell cancers to demonstrate its efficacy, identify markers of sensitivity and characterize its effects. The transcription factor HIF-2, an important driver of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, has been called 'undruggable'. However, in this issue of Nature, two groups report on the development and testing of a novel HIF-2α inhibitor, termed PT2399. William Kaelin and colleagues show that PT2399 causes tumour regression in preclinical mouse models of primary and metastatic pVHL-defective clear cell renal cell carcinoma. James Brugarolas and colleagues tested the compound in mice with tumour grafts generated from human renal cell cancers. PT2399 decreased tumour growth in 10 out of 18 cell lines and was well tolerated. The authors identify potential markers of sensitivity and provide initial characterization of the effects and mechanisms of resistance acquisition in vivo. Both groups report variable sensitivity to PT2399 in some pVHL-defective cell lines, highlighting a need for predictive biomarkers to be developed for use of this approach in the clinic. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene (VHL)1,2. Because no other gene is mutated as frequently in ccRCC and VHL mutations are truncal3, VHL inactivation is regarded as the governing event4. VHL loss activates the HIF-2 transcription factor, and constitutive HIF-2 activity restores tumorigenesis in VHL-reconstituted ccRCC cells5. HIF-2 has been implicated in angiogenesis and multiple other processes6,7,8,9, but angiogenesis is the main target of drugs such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib10. HIF-2 has been regarded as undruggable11. Here we use a tumourgraft/patient-derived xenograft platform12,13 to evaluate PT2399, a selective HIF-2 antagonist that was identified using a structure-based design approach. PT2399 dissociated HIF-2 (an obligatory heterodimer of HIF-2α–HIF-1β)14 in human ccRCC cells and suppressed tumorigenesis in 56% (10 out of 18) of such lines. PT2399 had greater activity than sunitinib, was active in sunitinib-progressing tumours, and was better tolerated. Unexpectedly, some VHL-mutant ccRCCs were resistant to PT2399. Resistance occurred despite HIF-2 dissociation in tumours and evidence of Hif-2 inhibition in the mouse, as determined by suppression of circulating erythropoietin, a HIF-2 target15 and possible pharmacodynamic marker. We identified a HIF-2-dependent gene signature in sensitive tumours. Gene expression was largely unaffected by PT2399 in resistant tumours, illustrating the specificity of the drug. Sensitive tumours exhibited a distinguishing gene expression signature and generally higher levels of HIF-2α. Prolonged PT2399 treatment led to resistance. We identified binding site and second site suppressor mutations in HIF-2α and HIF-1β, respectively. Both mutations preserved HIF-2 dimers despite treatment with PT2399. Finally, an extensively pretreated patient whose tumour had given rise to a sensitive tumourgraft showed disease control for more than 11 months when treated with a close analogue of PT2399, PT2385. We validate HIF-2 as a target in ccRCC, show that some ccRCCs are HIF-2 independent, and set the stage for biomarker-driven clinical trials. },

Understanding these associations may elucidate pathways for risk stratification according to diet. Patients undergoing screening colonoscopy were included in our prospective, single center study and divided into adenoma or no adenoma cohorts. Oral, fecal, and mucosal samples were obtained. Microbial DNA was extracted, and amplicon libraries generated using primers for the 16S rRNA gene V4 region. Patient and dietary information was collected. Of 104 participants, 44% presented with polyps, which were predominantly tubular adenomas (87%). Adenoma formation and multiple patient dietary and lifestyle characteristics were associated with mucosal microbiome diversity. Lifestyle factors included age, body mass index, adenoma number, and dietary consumption of red meats, processed meats, vegetables, fruit, grain, fermented foods and alcohol. In this study we showed associations between dietary habits, adenoma formation and the mucosal microbiome. These early findings suggest that ongoing research into diet modification may help reduce adenoma formation and subsequently the development of CRC. },

Research on poverty using the cognitive bandwidth approach would benefit from considering the cultural schemas that influence how people perceive and prioritize needs. Dual-process&nbsp;morality researchers could explain variation by analysing cultural repertoires that structure moral choices. Research using the implicit association test can better explain implicit attitudes by addressing the variability in cultural schemas that undergird biases. We identify how these research programmes can deepen the causal understanding of human attitudes and behaviours by addressing the interaction between internal cognition and supra-individual cultural repertoires. Lamont et al. identify opportunities for cognitive bandwidth, dual-process&nbsp;morality and implicit association research to engage with ‘cultural repertoires’, defined as cultural schemas, frames, narratives, scripts and boundaries that actors draw on in social situations. },

  abstract={ A new small-molecule inhibitor that selectively binds an internal cavity in HIF-2α allosterically disrupts HIF-2α–ARNT interaction in vitro and in cells. This compound should allow scientists to interrogate HIF-2α's activity in hypoxia and cancer cells. Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are heterodimeric transcription factors induced in many cancers where they frequently promote the expression of protumorigenic pathways. Though transcription factors are typically considered 'undruggable', the PAS-B domain of the HIF-2α subunit contains a large cavity within its hydrophobic core that offers a unique foothold for small-molecule regulation. Here we identify artificial ligands that bind within this pocket and characterize the resulting structural and functional changes caused by binding. Notably, these ligands antagonize HIF-2 heterodimerization and DNA-binding activity in vitro and in cultured cells, reducing HIF-2 target gene expression. Despite the high sequence identity between HIF-2α and HIF-1α, these ligands are highly selective and do not affect HIF-1 function. These chemical tools establish the molecular basis for selective regulation of HIF-2, providing potential therapeutic opportunities to intervene in HIF-2–driven tumors, such as renal cell carcinomas. },

  abstract={ Tertiary lymphoid structures play important roles in autoimmune and non-autoimmune conditions. While many of the molecular mechanisms involved in tertiary lymphoid structure formation have been identified, the cellular sources and temporal and spatial relationship remain unknown. Here we use combine single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of minor salivary glands of patients with Sjogren’s disease and Sicca Syndrome, with ex-vivo functional studies to construct a cellular and spatial map of key components involved in the formation and function of tertiary lymphoid structures. We confirm the presence of a fibroblast cell state and identify a pericyte/mural cell state with potential immunological functions. The identification of cellular properties associated with these structures and the molecular and functional interactions identified by this analysis may provide key therapeutic cues for tertiary lymphoid structures associated conditions in autoimmunity and cancer. Tertiary lymphoid structures play important roles during homeostatic but also immunopathological conditions including autoimmune disorders. Here the authors integrate single cell sequencing with spatial proteomics and transcriptomics to define a cellular and spatial map of tertiary lymphoid structures in salivary glands of patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. },

  abstract={ Immunofibroblasts have been described within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) that regulate lymphocyte aggregation at sites of chronic inflammation. Here we report, for the first time, an immunoregulatory property of this population, dependent on inducible T-cell co-stimulator ligand and its ligand (ICOS/ICOS-L). During inflammation, immunofibroblasts, alongside other antigen presenting cells, like dendritic cells (DCs), upregulate ICOSL, binding incoming ICOS + T cells and inducing LTα3 production that, in turn, drives the chemokine production required for TLS assembly via TNFRI/II engagement. Pharmacological or genetic blocking of ICOS/ICOS-L interaction results in defective LTα expression, abrogating both lymphoid chemokine production and TLS formation. These data provide evidence of a previously unknown function for ICOSL-ICOS interaction, unveil a novel immunomodulatory function for immunofibroblasts, and reveal a key regulatory function of LTα3, both as biomarker of TLS establishment and as first driver of TLS formation and maintenance in mice and humans. The study suggests a link between ICOS-ICOSL signaling and LTa3 induction on T cells. LTa3 subsequently activates fibroblasts in the salivary gland, leading to formation of tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLS). },

  abstract={ Reward-evoked dopamine transients are well established as prediction errors. However, the central tenet of temporal difference accounts—that similar transients evoked by reward-predictive cues also function as errors—remains untested. In the present communication we addressed this by showing that optogenetically shunting dopamine activity at the start of a reward-predicting cue prevents second-order conditioning without affecting blocking. These results indicate that cue-evoked transients function as temporal-difference prediction errors rather than reward predictions. Maes et al. use second-order conditioning, blocking and optogenetic inhibition to show that cue-evoked dopamine transients function as temporal-difference prediction errors rather than reward predictions. },

  abstract={ Experimental research controls for past experience, yet prior experience influences how we learn. Here, we tested whether we could recruit a neural population that usually encodes rewards to encode aversive events. Specifically, we found that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) were not involved in learning about fear in naïve rats. However, if these rats had prior experience with rewards, LH GABAergic neurons became important for learning about fear. Interestingly, inhibition of these neurons paradoxically enhanced learning about neutral sensory information, regardless of prior experience, suggesting that LH GABAergic neurons normally oppose learning about irrelevant information. These experiments suggest that prior experience shapes the neural circuits recruited for future learning in a highly specific manner, reopening the neural boundaries we have drawn for learning of particular types of information from work in naïve subjects. Sharpe et al. find that prior reward-learning experience can prime reward circuits to encode fear memories. This suggests prior experience can shape the way we learn, opening the neural boundaries for learning about particular types of information. },

  abstract={ Modern engineering curricula have started to emphasize design, mostly in the form of design-build experiences. Apart from instilling important problem-solving skills, such pedagogical frameworks address the critical social skill aspects of engineering education due to their team-based, project-based nature. However, it is required of the twenty-first century engineer to be not only technically competent and socially and culturally aware, but also innovative and entrepreneurial. This paper discusses a reformulated first-year engineering course at the University of Pretoria, which was adopted 6&nbsp;years ago to better address the required innovation skills of engineering students. This design-build-innovate course employs a unique creative problem-solving strategy in designing and building solutions to set technological problems. The students further investigate the provisional patenting of their design concepts. Mini business plans are developed and the students participate in a university- and in a national innovation competition. This introductory engineering course has been successful as measured by overwhelmingly positive student feedback, several provisional patents, and a number of small start-up companies that emanated from the students’ work. },

  abstract={ Teacher education programs help teachers gain knowledge and skills, develop ‘new’ attitudes, and impact their beliefs about teaching, thereby favorably affecting teaching outcomes. In the absence of national standards and formal studies in Lebanon of existing teacher preparation programs, findings of this study could greatly contribute to needed research in the field and inform policy makers. This study examines a pre-service education program at a private university in Lebanon for the purpose of assessing the program’s learning outcomes. Qualitative data were collected from questionnaires, pre and post surveys, and reflective journals focusing on perceptions of an effective teacher before and after training to detect any development from 50 student–teachers enrolled in the senior practicum classes during the scholastic year when the study was conducted. Fifteen student journals were examined for their reflections on principles, facts and techniques acquired, changes in behavior after training, and the relation of learned theory to work field in light of what they had experienced during their 180&nbsp;h of fieldwork and seminars at the university. Results were then compared to the program’s stated learning outcomes to assess whether they were achieved. Findings indicated that training positively affects student–teachers, but still more rigorous steps should be taken to ensure that all learning outcomes are met. Implications for program training improvement and recommendations for future research are made. },

  abstract={ We investigated students' metacognitive experiences with regard to feelings of difficulty (FD), feelings of satisfaction (FS), and estimate of effort (EE), employing either computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or computerized fixed item testing (FIT). In an experimental approach, 174 students in grades 10 to 13 were tested either with a CAT or a FIT version of a matrices test. Data revealed that metacognitive experiences were not related to the resulting test scores for CAT: test takers who took the matrices test in an adaptive mode were paradoxically more satisfied with their performance the worse they had performed in terms of the resulting ability parameter. They also rated the test as easier the lower they had performed, but their estimates of effort were higher the better they had performed. For test takers who took the FIT version, completely different results were revealed. In line with previous results, test takers were supposed to base these experiences on the subjectively estimated percentage of items solved. This moderated mediation hypothesis was in parts confirmed, as the relation between the percentage of items solved and FD, FS, and EE was revealed to be mediated by the estimated percentage of items solved. Results are discussed with reference to feedback acceptance, errant self-estimations, and test fairness with regard to a possible false regulation of effort in lower ability groups when using CAT. },
