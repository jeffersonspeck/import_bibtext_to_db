  abstract={With the multimedia and network technology widely using in teaching, the multiple intelligence theory was proposed. It suggests that the traditional notion of intelligence, based on I.Q. testing, is too limited. It provides a new perspective for the curriculum development, implementation and evaluation in the multimedia and network environment. From the perspective of the curriculum reform, this paper analyzes the conception of the “intelligence curriculum” in the multimedia and network environment, through the analysis of the “intelligence curriculum” characteristics under the guidance of the multiple intelligences, this paper presents a new model for modern classroom teaching -“intelligence course” based on the multiple intelligence theory.},

  abstract={Learning characteristics, as informed by research, vary for each individual learner. Research suggests that knowledge is processed and represented in different ways and that students prefer to use different types of resources in distinct ways. However, building Adaptive Educational systems that adapt to different learning characteristics is not easy. Major research questions exist such as: how are the relevant learning characteristics identified, how does modelling of the learner take place and in what way should the learning environment change for users with different learning characteristics?EDUCE is one system that addresses these challenges by using Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as the basis for dynamically modelling learning characteristics and for designing instructional material. This paper describes a research study, using EDUCE, that explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies and the impact on learning performance when material is matched and mismatched with learning preferences. The results suggest that students with low levels of learning activity, and who use only a limited number of the resources available, have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies and that surprisingly learning gain increases when they are provided with resources not normally preferred.},

  pages={46-49},
  abstract={Association rule mining is an important topic in big data analytics, discovering useful knowledge hidden in massive amounts of data and uncovering correlations, dependencies and causal structures between data items to provide support for aiding decision-making. The multiple intelligences theory includes eight relatively independent yet interconnected intelligences, emphasising the diversity of human abilities and playing a positive role in influencing teacher growth. Using association rule mining as a basis and combining it with multiple intelligences theory to study teacher development can help cultivate teachers with creative awareness and innovative spirit. This paper investigates the principle and algorithmic process of the Apriori algorithm, constructs the general structure of multiple intelligences theory, and proposes strategies for multiple intelligences teacher growth under association rule mining to provide theoretical support for teacher growth research.},

  abstract={Intelligence of a person can be enhanced if the person focuses and practices regularly. ATIE©, a psychometric test, was developed based on the Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory of Howard Gardner to measure eight types of intelligence skills namely musical, kinesthetic, math-logic, spatial, verbal, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist. The inverse model of ATIE , Fuzzy Inverse ATIE (FIA) was developed to get the best intelligence parameters that would be garnered to maximize the employment probability of people with epilepsy (PWE). In this paper, we present a conceptual framework of a model to rank the suggested intelligences obtained from FIA which are to be improved. This information is essential in order to improve the chances of PWE to be employed.},

  abstract={Children are important things that Allah SWT gives to parents. Make them grow is the main task of parents. There is an important period for children's development. The period is when children aged 7-12 years, because at this age the fat tissue that covers nerve cells or called "White Matter" increases. The increases of white matter cause an acceleration of signal processing to the brain in children. During this period, Prefrontal-Cortex reaches maturity, because of that parents need to pay more attention to their children. So, their potential can develop properly. Digital parenting device is designed to be integrated with parents' smartphones through the cloud database. This digital parenting device will be used by children to run multiple intelligence tests, display daily activity schedules, check multiple intelligence's score and run some application that apply the theory of Multiple Intelligence so the potentials that exist in children can develop. Through field testing period that has been carried out for two weeks, five female respondents aged 12 years do the test and multiple intelligence activities based on parents' application. After testing period, value of the difference in child development and the duration of use of the application is obtained. To find out the relationship between the two variable, Pearson correlation equations are used. From this equation, the calculated value is greater than table calculation. The calculated value is 0.874225 and the table calculation value is 0.8054 (sig. 0.1). Calculated value of 0.874225 categorized as very strong correlation.},

  abstract={Due to the Corona crisis teaching in higher education was shifted to online learning and has changed the lives of learners around the world. Students study in online courses from home and sit in front of technical devices all day. To get the students’ attention teachers need to find new ways of teaching. Smart gamification allows the students to participate in many ways in the lectures. As Howard Gardener states in the Multiple Intelligence Theory people have different intelligence types and need to be activated individually. Lecturers from different universities in Europe have come together to develop and exchange new methods to keep the students active during the STEM lectures and increase their motivation to study (STEM=science, technology, engineering, mathematics). Furthermore, students have the chance to collaborate in virtual mobility with students from Germany, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. A tool is needed that gets the students’ attention with addressing different intelligence types Gardener classified, e.g. musical, visual, verbal, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic, existential. With the WBS LearnSpace 3D®, which is a tool for online working academia, students and lecturers from different countries are brought together on a virtual campus which takes virtual mobility to a next level.},

From this perspective, the psychology offers its instruments, aiming to provide reflection and self-knowledge through professional guidance. The work of professional guidance leads the subject to know himself, in the sense of enabling a choice more lucid, mature, adjusted and according to the abilities of each individual. Information about the cognitive resources that people deem to be available may be relevant to a decision-making in relation to professional life, since each profession requires certain skills and competences for it to be exercised [5]. In this sense, an information system was developed for the professional guidance of the students of the Federal Institute of Goiás, considering the theory of multiple intelligences of the psychologist Howard Gardner of Harvard University. With this system, the IFG can effectively help its students in the choice of their professions.},

  abstract={Google's Android operating system right from its inception has been gradually capturing the hearts and operating system platforms of mobile devices of a major share of the world population. Intelligence of an individual can be differentiated into nine types. Every individual possesses each of these intelligences in varying proportions. A Multiple Intelligence Inventory is capable of determining which intelligence is strongest for a person. This paper presents an Android based application (app) that will offer a free platform to users to self evaluate and know their strongest intelligence area. The app aims to provide the users with an authentic Multiple Intelligence Inventory and process the results for them free of cost and help them self-evaluate and self-guide for a better future. It is meant to empower individuals and not to label them. It is particularly meant for people who cannot afford to go to a psychologist or a counselor and very often fall prey to the compulsions and influences of the society and go on doing things they aren't good at, instead of doing things they are capable of and end up being disappointed in life. “Everybody is a genius.

  abstract={The theory of Multiple Intelligences has been widely applied in exchange of intelligence test approach with the single score (IQ). One of the applications of MI-based learning strategies is to group students based on Multiple Intelligence Research (MIR) scores. In this study, students are grouped based on MIR scores using multilevel clustering techniques. Multiple clustering is applied to meet the needs of the equal number of students and gender. Several models of multilevel clustering using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and K-Means algorithms are carried out. The evaluation results show that the smallest error is generated by the multilevel SOM. This method can facilitate students grouping based on MIR scores by maintaining the similarity of student features and class heterogeneity. This clustering method is expected to be an efficient way to group students automatically and effectively according to MI-based learning strategies.},

  abstract={The role of employment guidance in employment management is very important, but there is a problem of inaccurate outcome evaluation. The didactic teaching model cannot solve the problem of employment guidance in employment management, and the evaluation is unreasonable. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved decision tree method to optimize employment guidance analysis. First, the multiple intelligence theory is used to evaluate students, and the indicators are divided according to the requirements of employment guidance to reduce employment guidance in the interfering factor. Then, the multiple intelligence theory optimizes the employment guidance for students, forms the employment guidance program, and conducts the employment guidance results Comprehensive analysis. MATLAB simulation shows that under the condition of certain evaluation criteria, the employment rate and internship rate of improved decision tree method for students' career guidance are improved All are superior to the didactic teaching mode.},

  abstract={Under the guidance of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, this study aims to find whether music training can improve English stress production among Chinese English learners without music background. Major findings are as follows. (1) In stress production, music training has significant influence on the stress production by Chinese English learners. Specifically, after music training, there has been evident improvement in pitch and intensity in the training group in distinguishing stressed and unstressed syllables in disyllabic pseudowords. Besides, the accuracy of the production of unfamiliar words in the training group has increased by 11.5% on average, compared with that of the control group which has little change. In addition, little effect of music training on duration proportion in stressed syllables is found in this experiment. (2) Chinese English learners' perception of music can be positively transferred to their production of English lexical stress. Such findings provide further proof for the effect of music training on the production of English lexical stress, and propose a method for Chinese English learners to improve their English pronunciation.},

  abstract={The demand for personalized and adaptive learning according to learner needs and preferences is based on the learner model; learning style is one of the main components that make up the learner model. One learning style based on the cognitive approach is the multiple-intelligence learning style, which has performed well in face-to-face learning. However, the application of multiple intelligence learning styles in e-Iearning still needs to be improved. The main obstacle is the low performance of this learning style detection classification in online learning. This research aims to improve the classification performance of multiple intelligence learning styles detection in online learning by applying feature extraction techniques to the dataset. This research uses data analysis methods, including data collection from learning interactions with the module-based Learning Management System (LMS) owned by the Directorate General of Teachers and Education Personnel, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, Republic of Indonesia to form a dataset, using the Multiple Intelligences Inventory to obtain the dominant intelligence class value, data preprocessing, application of SMOTE-Tomek resampling technique to overcome the problem of the imbalanced dataset, applying feature extraction techniques Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), selection of machine learning classifier models namely K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), model validation using k-fold cross-validation technique, and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and fl-score metrics. The experimental results show that the SVM classification performance accuracy reaches 83.33 % on the dataset using SVD, 80.56% on the dataset using ICA, and RF reaches 80.11 % on the dataset using SVD, a promising result for future development.},

  abstract={In this paper, a software system, which employs an intelligent approach to adjust learning process more accurately by determining student's learning status, is described briefly. The system comes with an Artificial Neural Networks based infrastructure to evaluate students' learning styles or levels before feeding its interface with the related course contents. The Artificial Neural Networks structure is mainly fed with answers that were given for a specially designed Multiple Intelligences test and this data is also combined with some other ones like examination grades, or points given by the course teacher for each student. Eventually, the stored course contents are then viewed to the active student, according to his / her learning status determined by the system. The designed and developed software system has been tested during the "visual programming" course and obtained results have been also reported in this study.},

  abstract={There are different theories to estimate cognitive abilities. Gardner proposed a model, where intelligence is defined by multiple fields instead of using one specific number. However, the characterization and automated evaluation of these fields are still open issues. If we can make standalone measurements in separate intelligence fields, the numerical modeling of the competencies is possible. Observing the cognitive abilities of children can lead us to an optimized learning experience in performance and engagement. Our aim is to automatically match problem sets and intelligence fields in order to achieve a faster and deeper learning experience. The amount of data to be collected makes the automation of this process a focus point of these studies. In this paper we present an automatic cognitive profiling system with the help of smart devices and AdaptEd — an adaptive educational gaming framework. With the presented system the learning methods and tasks can be fine-tuned, and a personalized and more effective learning environment can be achieved.},

  abstract={One of the functions of personalized learning is to provide learning resources/materials that match the needs and preferences of learner characteristics. The management of learner characteristics uses a learner model that contains basic information, knowledge level, learning style, and cognitive traits of the learner. The theory of multiple intelligences is based on cognitive research; it has been applied in traditional learning and successfully influences and impacts learning performance. However, applying multiple intelligence learning styles in e-learning still needs improvement. One of the main obstacles is the low accuracy of this learning style detection in online learning. This research aims to implement a machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine, which is expected to improve the performance of multiple learning styles classification. This research uses data analysis methods, including data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation. The data in this research is sourced from learners’ interactions with an online learning platform, namely a module-based Learning Management System (LMS) owned by the Directorate General of Teachers and Education Personnel, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology, Republic of Indonesia. This research has produced the results of the Support Vector Machine (SVM)classification accuracy performance test, reaching 83.64% using the Radial kernel, which is promising for future development.},

  abstract={Adaptivity is an important aspect in computer based educational environments and one where the building of automated and intelligent systems that support it has been a challenge. In fact, the automatic detection of the pedagogical traits in order to construct a student model that allows inference of the next step in the learning process has been one of the main goals when producing adaptive systems. Learning styles and multiple intelligence theories have been widely used in student modeling to show how a student ad quires knowledge and highlights special learning abilities. Through the bringing together of these two areas of learning a picture of an individual student can be made. This information therefore becomes useful for a tutor to adapt the learning process to the student. It is therefore within this context that this study proposes an innovative method that is driven by the Kolb learning process in order to improve the intelligence percentages by bringing out in each individual those areas in which they excel, but also help in the improvement of the learning process where deficiency is detected. Thus, this method is able to detect and correct automatically the initial self-evaluation. The selection of learning objects during the learning process is carried out by a particle swarm algorithm.},

  pages={5681-5691},
  abstract={Photovoltaic output and load uncertainty are prone to cause voltage fluctuations in a distribution network, which can affect the power quality. With a particular focus on the distribution network voltage overrun caused by this problem, we propose a two-stage multi-mode voltage control strategy for distribution networks based on deep reinforcement learning to mitigate voltage fluctuations while realizing coordinated operation among different devices. First, the on-load regulator transformer and capacitor bank are effectively controlled using a centralized control strategy in the day-ahead phase to obtain the optimal tidal current for the distribution network, in order to achieve optimal operation of the long time-scale equipment of the system. Then, a distributed control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning with multiple intelligences is applied to regulate the reactive power of the photovoltaic inverters, based on local observations in the intraday phase, to provide fast, flexible, and reactive power support for the distribution network. Finally, a multi-mode data-driven conversion strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is used to coordinate and convert between different control modes, to enable the system to effectively reduce voltage offsets and reactive power losses under varying operational demand. The proposed method is experimentally validated on an improved IEEE 33-node distribution system, and the results show that it can effectively solve the voltage overrun problem and reduce the reactive power loss in the distribution system.},

For this reason, some dimensions have been identified by taking inspiration from the most popular and accepted models that are related to different theories of Cognitive Styles, Learning Styles and Preferences. A test has been submitted to two different groups of students and two types of analysis have been performed. Firstly, a correlation analysis have been done, within the same group of students, among the different dimensions. Then, significant differences, within the same dimension, between the two groups have been sought. Results have shown that, assuming a typical probability level, some interesting correlations among the dimensions could be detected. Furthermore, in some dimensions, significant differences appeared between the two groups. Finally, it is worth noticing that the test results have been useful both to the teacher, in order to improve the didactic method in class, and to the students, who can receive suggestions and counseling on their personal learning methods.},

  abstract={Already for years, the logic course in the first year of our Bachelor program in Computer Science has been a serious stumbling block for many students. They find the formal and abstract mechanisms of logic difficult and awkward to deal with. Many procrastinate, which results in poor understanding of the basic principles, which in turn causes them to fall even more behind. Previous attempts to remedy this have had little effect. Since educational games are deemed as an enjoyable way to foster learning, we decided to develop an educational game for the course. The game is a two-player competitive game inspired by an existing card game. We adapted this card game to proposition logic and digitized it as an app. The development was done in an iterative way. Each version was evaluated and based on the received feedback the software was improved and reevaluated. Based on the results of the evaluations we can conclude that the game is well suited for its target audience and is a good complement, and even replacement for some of the traditional face-to-face exercise sessions. However, we also noticed that making the game available without obligation to use was not the best approach. A good embedding into the course is needed to ensure that all students use the game. In this paper we present the game, explain and motivate its evolution, and present lessons learned.},

  abstract={Purpose: With the development of information technology, there are more and more practical problems in computer data processing and analysis. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the development of children's intelligence through a general linear data processing model, and to provide support for improving the development of children's intelligence. Methods: This research focuses on the use of a general linear data analysis model.A total of 176 children aged 3 to 6 years were selected as the research objects, and they were randomly divided into control class and experimental class for 24 weeks, 5 times/week, 30min/time. The daily outdoor activities of the children in the experimental class used multiple sports activity modules, while the daily outdoor activities of the children in the control class used general physical activity content. The activity time, intensity and frequency of children in the experimental class and the control class were basically the same. Results: 1) The general linear data analysis showed that the verbal intelligence, physical and motor intelligence, introspective intelligence and natural intelligence of 3–4 year old children were significantly affected by the interaction of time and intervention factors, and the interpersonal intelligence of 4–5 year old children changed significantly., Musical intelligence and natural intelligence were significantly affected by the interaction of time and intervention factors, and the physical and motor intelligence and interpersonal intelligence of children aged 5–6 were significantly affected by the interaction of time and intervention factors. 2) SPSS data processing shows that after the intervention of the multiple sports activity module, the children's linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, physical and motor intelligence, introspective intelligence, musical intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, natural intelligence and multiple The total score of intelligence was significantly different from that before the intervention (P<0.05); the language intelligence, physical and motor intelligence, logic-mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence and intelligence total scores of children in each age group in the control class were higher than those before the intervention, and the difference was significant. (P<0.05); the total scores of children's language intelligence, logic-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, physical and motor intelligence, introspective intelligence, musical intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, natural intelligence and multiple intelligences in each age group in the experimental class were compared with those in the control class, the difference was significant (P<0.05) 3) Conclusion: The joint analysis of the general linear data processing model and the T test in the S data analysis software shows that the multi-sports activity module is superior to the general physical activity content in developing children's multi-intelligence development., and the general linear data processing model can be used to analyze the influencing factors of children's multiple intelligence development.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of including the multiple-intelligence strategy when designing an e-content on the satisfaction and achievement of postgraduate students at the Arabian Gulf University. An experimental method with a quasi-experimental design was used due to the difficulty of randomly assigning the sample. Participants, males and females, were selected from the students of the Gifted Education Program at the Arabian Gulf University. The sample consisted of two groups: experimental (n=29) and control (n=22). The experimental group students studied the e-learning program through the Virtual Learning Environment (WebCT) and they were communicated using all the tools available in the virtual learning environment (VLE) such as e-mails and Discussion. The e-content was designed via instructional interactive activities that develop students' intelligence determined by using Multiple-Intelligences Scale administered before the experiment. It indicated that there are three types of intelligence in the experimental group individuals: self, logical, social.  The e-content was presented in three different forms to fit each type of intelligences. The controls studied the same course using face to face method. This study used several measures: Gardner's Multiple-Intelligence Scale, Questionnaire of Major Satisfaction, and Achievement Test. Results indicated that there are statistically significant differences among the mean scores of the experimental and control groups in the total of the final achievement test in favour of the experimental group. Furthermore, students were more satisfied with learning method using e-learning program than face-to-face method.},

  abstract={The Peer Project Learning (PPL) methodology is presented as a new active learning method based on Peer Instruction (IP) model and project-based learning (PBL). The methodological structure of PPL is shown, detailing its components, which are separated by stages, so that the instructional designs of this methodology can be used as educational strategies that allow students to engage an active learning process. This work shows two studies based on the PPL methodology. The first study, carried out in 2016 in person-person classes, shows effectiveness of the methodology through a quantitative analysis of the learning gain by students who studied a science course under the methodology in mention. This first group of results shows that students had greater learning gains in the PPL methodology than in traditional methodology. The second study, conducted in 2020 in a virtual classes, shows that the implementation of PPL methodology allows to explore the multiple intelligences of students and their own learning styles. The results of this second study will be shown in two sets: the first one presents the multiple intelligences developed along with the learning styles implemented by students; and the second one demonstrates the correlation between developed intelligences and learning styles. Based on these results it is concluded that students develop teamwork skills and problem solving associated with logical-mathematical, verbal-linguistic and interpersonal intelligences. Strategies are suggested so that instructors can use them in their classes, to best exploit the different multiple intelligences of their students based on the implementation of this methodology.},

  abstract={In the context of games for learning, it is argued that taking individual differences among players into consideration during game design can be beneficial for the game and/or learning experience. Researchers have studied a variety of factors that can be used for taking individual differences among players into consideration. Although research work indicates that the intelligence levels according to the theory of Multiple Intelligences may be a promising direction to follow, this direction is among the least explored ones. The research presented in this paper explores the applicability of the theory of Multiple Intelligences for personalized and player-centered (serious) game design using empirical evidence. Our results show that there is a correlation between gamers' intelligences, their preference for games, and game mechanics. To release the results to the game development community, a kind of recommendation system has been developed that provides information about appropriate and non-appropriated game mechanics for different intelligence dimensions.},

  pages={980-989},
  abstract={One of the fundamental mechanical constructions of ships and navigators is the cylindrical shell structure. Their damping control is difficult to predict and frequently depends on precise control models. For that reason, this work provides a data-driven multi-intelligence reinforcement learning damping control approach that is significance for damping control of massive structures. Firstly, the dynamics equations of cylindrical shell structure are established based on the hypothetical modal method, and modal variables are introduced to derive the state-space equations for damping control of cylindrical shell structure, and an interactive environment for multi-intelligent reinforcement learning is established. Secondly, the damping control strategy of cylindrical shell structure with multiple intelligences is designed based on the value decomposition QMIX algorithm. For a single smart body design vibration displacement, velocity, piezoelectric actuator voltage, smart body operation steps as the state space, quadratic performance indicators with saturation characteristics as the damping effect reward function, greedy strategy as damping action selection method for multi-intelligent body cooperative damping. The QMIX algorithm hybrid network performs fusion evaluation of the joint action value of each intelligence and updates the action value function of a single intelligence. Finally, five sets of hyperparameters are set based on the Grid Search approach for comparative simulation experiments for deep learning network hyperparameter selection. The result of the simulation demonstrate that the current tactic effectively suppresses the vibration of the cylindrical shell construction. Furthermore, the optimal hyperparameter is determined by comparing simulation trials with different values, proving that the approach described in this article has better damping performance under this parameter.},

  abstract={US Department of Defense (DoD) big data is extensively multimodal and multiple intelligence (multi-INT), where structured sensor and unstructured audio, video and textual ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) data are generated by numerous air, ground, and space borne sensors along with human intelligence. Data fusion at all levels “remains a challenging task.” While there are algorithmic stove-piped systems that work well on individual modalities, there is no system to date that is mission and source agnostics and can seamlessly integrate and correlate multi-INT data that includes textual, hyperspectral, and video content. The considerable volume and velocity aspects of big data only compound the aforementioned encountered in fusion. We have developed the concept of “deep fusion”1based on deep learning models adapted to process multiple modalities of big data. Rather than reducing each modality independently and fusing at a higher-level model (feature-level fusion), the deep fusion approach generates a set of multimodal features, thereby maintaining the core properties of the dissimilar signals and resulting in fused models of higher accuracy. We have initiated two deep fusion experiments - one is to automatically generate the caption of an image to help analysts tagging and captioning large volumes of images gathered from collection platforms, and the other is an audio-visual speech classification with potential applications to lip-reading and enhanced object tracking. This paper presents the proof-of-concept demonstration for caption generation. The generative model is based on a deep recurrent architecture combined with the pre-trained image-to-vector model Inception V3 via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the word-to-vectors model word2vec via a skip-gram model. We make use of the Flickr8K dataset extended with some military specific images to make the demonstration more relevant to the DoD domain. The detailed results from the image captioning experiment is presented here. The captions are generated from test image are subjectively evaluated and the BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) scores are compared and found substantial improvements.},

  abstract={In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical multiple intelligences architecture consisting of three intelligences: biology intelligence, space intelligence and robot intelligence. This new intelligence architecture aims to address defects of existing intelligence architecture for controlling mobile robots. The performers of the three intelligences are human, intelligent space and robot, respectively. Human sends commands according to his or her intentions and requirements. The intelligent space integrates and provides comprehensive spatial information to assist the robot in the space. The robot performs tasks with the help of intelligent space to meet requirements of people. The proposed intelligence architecture was verified in a simulated experiment platform in which a robot accomplished two tasks including bringing a bottle and bringing an apple. A contrast experiment was conducted using the control mode that the robot was controlled by the user combining additional robot intelligence in the same simulated experiment platform. Experimental results show that the performance of the hierarchical intelligence mode is better than the contrastive control mode without space intelligence.},

  abstract={To address the problem of spectrum resources and transmitting power for vehicular networks, this paper proposes a resource allocation (RA) method based on dueling double deep-Q network (D3QN) reinforcement learning (RL). Due to the high mobility of the vehicle, the channel changes rapidly which makes it difficult to accurately collect high-accuracy channel state information at the base station and to perform centralized management. In response of this difficulty, we construct a multi-intelligence model, using Manhattan Grid Layout City Model as the basis of environment and with each vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link as an intelligence. They work together to interact with the environment, receive appropriate observations, get rewards, and finally learn to improve the allocation of power and spectrum to enable users to achieve a better entertainment experience and a safer driving environment. Experimental results demonstrate that with proper training mechanism and reward function construction, cooperation among multiple intelligence can be performed in a distributed manner, with improvements in both the capacity of total vehicle-to-infrastructure links and the effective payload delivery success rate of the V2V links compared to common Q-network.},

This study evaluates the relationship between multiple intelligences, entrepreneurial awareness, and students' academic performance through the use of the BeeBest application. Using the SEM-PLS method, the results show that Intrapersonal Intelligence (coefficient 0.55) and Logic Intelligence (coefficient 0.45) have a significant influence on academic achievement. Entrepreneurial Mindfulness also shows a positive contribution (coefficient 0.35), reflecting the importance of focus, creativity, and stress resilience in supporting academic success. This model explains 60% of the variability in academic performance, reinforcing the importance of a personalized approach in smart education. The BeeBest application is proven to be effective in supporting self-management and academic growth through features that monitor student potential and provide learning recommendations based on intelligence and entrepreneurial profiles.},

  abstract={With the increase in the number of electric vehicles, the connection of EVs greatly increases the load on the power grid. By controlling the charging and discharging of EVs in a reasonable way, EVs can play a key role in the regulation of the power grid. Taking the charging and discharging control algorithm of EVs as the research object, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm based on multiple intelligences to control the continuous charging and discharging behaviors of EVs. Aiming at the dynamic change of load timing in the distribution network, the charging and discharging power of different vehicles under different tariffs is controlled so that the users can get the maximum benefit. Considering the impact of EV charging on the distribution network, the optimal current is introduced to quantify the load caused by charging behavior on the network. Multiple EV systems in different environments are constructed as Markov decisions, and a multi-intelligence reinforcement learning algorithm is used to enable the vehicles to learn personalized charging and discharging strategies. The simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively regulate the charging and discharging behaviors of different vehicles and play the role of regulating the power grid, and the load caused by the algorithm on the power grid is more stable when the vehicles are charging.},

Traditional spectrum allocation methods often do not take into account inter-vehicle interference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to eliminate interference in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the MAS-EGNN framework. Initially, an Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) is utilized to dynamically update the graph representation through node and edge conditions to effectively capture the relationships and dependencies between vehicles. Subsequently, multi-intelligence reinforcement learning techniques allow multiple intelligences to interact simultaneously within the environment, with each independently adapting to changes in the surrounding environment to optimize overall network performance. The effectiveness of the approach in improving communication quality and system throughput is verified through the simulation of V2X communication scenarios and the implementation of corresponding optimization strategies. The experimental results show that the method significantly reduces interference and optimizes V2X spectrum allocation compared with the traditional spectrum allocation strategy.},

NIMA must understand what information truly matters and foster an analytical environment that encourages creativity and excellence. Achieving this vision will require transformation in a wide spectrum of activities, including leveraging revolutionary information and knowledge fusion methods, techniques and technologies. Since September 11, 2001, NIMA has restructured operations to ensure information superiority and is continuing the transformation from being a producer of imagery and geospatial information, to being a provider of geospatial intelligence that will enable decision dominance for its customers. The goals delineated by the NIMA Strategic Intent are based on delivering predictive and actionable decision knowledge extracted from fused data and information from multiple intelligence sources into a complete geospatially-referenced common operational picture (COP). The requirements of information superiority and decision dominance present tremendous challenges for NSGI and NIMA, as well as to the entire intelligence community. To rise to these challenges, NIMA envisions leveraging the best commercial and government business, operational and acquisition practices, migration strategies, commercial and mission specific technologies.},

  abstract={Virtual machine (VM) deployment is a critical aspect of cloud data center resource management that directly impacts performance, energy efficiency, and quality of service. Efficient VM deployment ensures optimal resource utilization, reduces power consumption, and lowers operating costs. However, the dynamic nature of cloud environments poses significant challenges to achieving optimal VM deployment. This study presents various intelligences, especially partial swarm optimization (PSO), as a powerful optimization technique for dynamic VM deployment. Many cognitive algorithms mimic the collective behavior of social organisms and provide an efficient approach to solving complex optimization problems. This study addresses the issue of deploying virtual machines to maximize resource utilization while reducing power consumption and ensuring quality of service. Extensive simulation shows that the proposed PSO-based method significantly outperforms conventional static and heuristic approaches regarding energy efficiency, resource utilization, and SLA compliance. The results show the potential of multiple intelligences in improving the operational efficiency of cloud data centers, leading to future research and practical implementation in dynamic cloud environments.},

  abstract={Gerontechnology is a new field which combines gerontology with technology to support elders in five ways: prevention, enhancement, compensation, care support, and research. Using a four layer model of a human, we examine theories, approaches, and technologies that can be used to address the needs of elders on each of these layers. Current gerontechnology applications primarily focus on the model's lower layers: the elder's physiological functioning and his/her physical skills and activities. We address the cognitive (third) layer through the theory of multiple intelligences, offering ways for elders to compensate for declining cognitive faculties. To address the social interaction (fourth) layer of the human model, we apply social network theory. Coupling collaborative technology with gerontechnology, we construct collaborative social networks to offer elders both care support and enhancement. These networks connect elders and their caregivers, thereby improving communication and offering increased social support to both elders and caregivers.},

  abstract={The authors report on a distributed adaptive learning system (DALS) project at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This project grew out of work reported previously by the first author (2001), in which he described a generic DALS based on his KAL model of human learning comprised of three interacting components, a knowledge space, a collection of intelligent agents called an agency and a learner space. The DALS view of a learner is an electronic file called the learner filter. What DALS presents to the learner is called a knowledge view. The DALS agency manages the interface between knowledge views and learner filters. The current project implements a basic prototype DALS as a proof of concept of the earlier work. The DALS prototype was developed by a graduate student, Sachin Sood, under the supervision of the first author. The third author, Bhavesh Advani, also a graduate student, is designing and integrating a multiple intelligence module into the prototype to provide an innovative new presentation mode. The goal of this project is to create a very broad foundation within which to assemble the many ideas and techniques for adaptive interaction available or being developed in both the academic and commercial venues. An underlying premise is that adaptive interaction strategies are propelling us toward practical theories for knowledge organization and user profiling, where users may be individuals, teams or large organizations, with objectives to learn, sell, persuade or govern, to mention a few possible goals. In our project the paradigm is an individual learner; but the model applies in other contexts as well.},

  year={2011},
  volume={23},
  number={1},
  pages={70-84},
  abstract={When designing with young children, designers usually select user centred design methods based on the children’s required level of engagement and the inspiration expected to be created according to the designer. User centred design methods should be selected for their suitability for children and for the quality of the output of the design method. To understand the suitability of design methods, a framework was developed to describe design methods in terms of required design skills as identified by the Theory of Multiple Intelligences. The proposed framework could provide the basis for a tool to compare design methods and to generate hypotheses about what design method would work optimally with children in a specific school grade. The initial examination of the viability of the framework is a comparison of design methods by the number of skills involved; earlier work showed that the involvement of more skills (as with, e.g. low-fi prototyping) could result in more options for a design problem than the involvement of fewer skills (as with e.g. brainstorming). Options and Criteria were counted to understand the quality of the method in terms of the amount of design-information. The results of the current paper indicate that 8-to-10-year-old children generate significantly more options in prototyping sessions than when they are involved in sessions applying a Nominal Group Technique. The paper indicates that (a) with the framework we can generate hypotheses to compare design methods with children and (b) that the outcome of various design methods, which might lead to very different representations, can be compared in terms of Options and Criteria. Further usage of the framework is expected to result in empirical support for selecting a design method to be applied with young children.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the cultivation of computational skills and the enhancement of students' intellectual abilities remain of paramount importance. This research paper delves into the innovative approach of leveraging Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory to foster computational skills among high school students. The study specifically focuses on a group of 26 computer science high school students at N azarbayev Intellectual School in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The research employs a comprehensive and structured methodology that integrates MI principles into the classroom environment. Over a designated timeframe, students participate in a variety of activities designed to engage and stimulate each of their unique intelligences. Language, mathematics, spatial perception, motor skills, music, personal, and intrapersonal communication intelligences are all encompassed in these pursuits., creating a holistic learning experience. Data collection encompasses a multitude of measures, including pre- and post-assessments, observations, and student feedback, to gauge demonstrate the significant improvement in students' computational abilities following the MI-enhanced curriculum. In particular, students displayed increased problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability when confronted with computational challenges. The conclusion of this study contribute significant analysis into the potential of MI theory to transform traditional computer science education. By providing a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that nurtures students' diverse intellectual strengths, educators can empower learners to excel in computational disciplines.

  abstract={Predicting students' success prior to their admission to computer-related degree programs is challenging due to diverse educational backgrounds and varying skill requirements. Educational Data Mining (EDM) can be used to optimize the college admission process by selecting only well-equipped students for the program. The attrition rate of the College of Computing Studies at Western Mindanao State University remains high despite the rigorous admission process for the Computer Science and Information Technology programs. Many students fail programming courses, causing them to leave the program. This study developed a decision support system and ensemble models by combining Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models using learning techniques such as voting, bagging, and stacking. The goal is to automate the admission of pre-qualified students based on their likelihood of success in programming courses. Factors such as SHSGPA, CET score, class rank, and specific personality traits significantly influence academic success. The combined models, particularly using stacking techniques, emerged as the most reliable and effective model for predicting unseen data compared to standalone classification models. Students and faculty members evaluated the functionality, reliability, and usability of the decision-support system. The feedback indicated a positive reception, affirming its potential as a valuable tool in the college's admission process. Future enhancements may include incorporating multiple intelligence and grit tests and exploring additional ensemble methods to improve predictive capabilities.},

  abstract={The concepts of spatial visualization and the geometrical calculation are important elements of multiple-intelligence development. According to the cognitive-development theory of Piaget, the students in 5th and 6th grade in the elementary school are on a level of concrete thinking, in which their thinking may have greater flexible alternatives, and begin to develop conservation concepts, including physical, spatial ability, and numerical conservation. For this reason, the training of the spatial ability is imperative for students around these ages. This study is investigated the possibility of utilizes a digital game to improve individual's spatial abilities. An action game is designed and developed to achieve the purpose of the study. The game uses the 3D Studio Max 9.0 to build 3-D models, Photoshop CS2 for drawing characters and scenes textures, and Virtools Dev 4.0 for developing the game. The tasks of this game are designed to increase spatial ability with rotating question, visual discrimination and visual memory with space, rotate, reverse, inference and displacement. This study provides a game design model of various entities for learners' contact, depict size, shape, aspect and position. After we completed the game, we applied experimental activities at two primary schools. From the observations and questionnaire results, we found out that this game can increase students' motivation and willingness in learning. Players also were immersed in this game and followed the instructional materials we apply integrated into this game.},

  abstract={With the increasing growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), WBAN (wireless body area network), as a kind of IoT, has attracted much attention. However, due to the problems of existing MAC protocols like poor flexibility and generalizability, a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)-based multilink scheduling algorithm with multiple intelligences called PM- WBAN is proposed in this paper. Firstly, based on the multiantenna technology and inter-coupling technology in the existing wearable field, we suggest a design of sensors with dual antennas that can work in dual frequency bands and adapt the flexible scheduling of the hub. Then, a Multi-Agent is proposed to optimize the multi-link scheduling within Intra-WBAN and the number of health packets sent by the sensors. Finally, in order to respond for the emergent traffic, PPO is introduced to improve the frame time length of slot-ALOHA and an adapted reward function is designed. Experiments verify that PM-WBAN can converge quickly. The results also demonstrate that PM-WBAN outperforms the benchmark algorithms such as Random, Max-Rate, and it is more adaptable for those scenarios with random load as well.},
