  abstract={This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm for regional communities based on cooperation mechanisms, taking into account the objective evolutionary goals of different countries and regions in historical processes, combined with the complex diplomatic relations and deep trade cooperation needs. We first represent regional cooperation as a complex system based on multiple intelligences; then, to avoid the algorithm from maturing prematurely and falling into local optimal solutions, we introduce an elite exploration mechanism to promote regional development; secondly, we propose a cooperative discriminative mechanism based on trust relationship; finally, we verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using research cases with fast solution speed and high solution accuracy. The experimental results show that, unlike the law of the jungle of the weak and the strong, the mutually beneficial open strategy is more conducive to the coevolution of regional individuals. This paper can better represent the complex network of relationships among multi-intelligent nodes and provide a reference for intelligent decision-making of complex systems.},

  abstract={A preliminary exploratory and predictive model to correlate the academic performance of a sample of 96 students enrolled in different basic engineering courses with cognitive and social constructs is presented. The model integrates several dimensions regarding Multiple Intelligences, Self-Regulation skills and Learning Styles constructs. The exploratory study is carried out with three statistical methods: analysis of principal components, correlation analysis and cluster formation. The prediction of students' final grades was accomplished from three perspectives: i) from the average final grade in each cluster, ii) obtaining rules to classify, a-priori, each student as “pass” or “fail” by means of decision trees, and iii) detecting those dimensions of the constructs that have a larger impact on students' grades, using linear regressions. It is found that the logical-mathematical intelligence has the largest positive impact and the anxiety of the students also has a significant, but negative, impact. It is also found that students who present a high intrinsic motivation are very likely to pass their courses. Additionally, it is found that the average grades in each cluster are the expected ones according to the characteristics defining the cluster. The results are encouraging and may serve to improve instructional design and the elaboration of more tailored didactic resources.},

Software to identify active groups within this mass of data has been an important focus of research and development. This paper describes experience with an integrated set of test methods developed to evaluate the technical accuracy and real-world value of group detection algorithms as applied to link datasets of varying size and characteristics. The testing includes an automated software harness to score the algorithms against representative datasets that are generated by a controlled random process from known ground truth. It also applies novel statistical benchmarks and techniques to evaluate the value of the algorithms as applied by analysts to real intelligence data where ground-truth is absent. Together, these tests have increased understanding of the determinants of algorithmic accuracy, aided in selection among competing software packages, and resulted in significantly improved accuracy and value-in-use as a result of feedback to developers.},

  abstract={Innovation and value proposition in distance-learning-programs (e-learning programs) is a multifaceted-activity with enormous dimensionality. The implementation of information communication technology (ICT) and enhanced enterprise-resource-planning (eERP) for smart-campuses has emerged as inevitability for industrial competitiveness in smart-factories as per the dictates of total quality management (TQM). The philosophy of productivity-management and concurrent engineering stipulates a competitive framework for e-learning for dissemination and absorption of knowledge by the intelligentsia, technologists and students. Conversely, competitiveness in today's global village demands an innovative and systems-approach for improving the learning-curves in a virtual environment. The e-learning-programs have numerous inherent perplexities since in every virtual classroom there is a much higher probability to interact with orthogonal-cultures that too with multiple-intelligences. This paper proposes a “conceptual-strategic-planning-framework” for diffusion of innovative in a distance learning program (Course-Technovation). The framework is based on literature review and field visits encompassing integrated “E-commerce-model-driven architecture” embedded with business intelligence and coupled with eERP-design functionalities.},

  abstract={This paper reports on the utility of social network analysis methods in the data fusion domain. Given fused data that combine multiple intelligence reports from the same environment, social network extraction and high value individual (HVI) identification are of interest. The research on the feasibility of such activities may help not only in methodological developments in network science but also in testing and evaluation of fusion quality. This paper offers a parallel computing-based methodology to extract a social network of individuals from fused data, captured as a cumulative associated data graph (CDG). To obtain the desired social network, two approaches including a hop count weighted and a path salience approach are developed and compared. A supervised learning framework is implemented for parameterizing the extraction algorithms. Parameters utilized in the extraction algorithm consider paths between individuals within the social network, weighing relationships between these individuals based on the count weighted and the path salience calculation methodologies. An overall link strength value is then calculated by aggregating path hop count weights and saliences between unique individual pairs for the hop count weighted and path salience approaches, respectively. Ordered centrality-based HVI lists are obtained from the CDGs constructed from the Sunni criminal thread and Bath'est resurgence threads of the SYNCOIN data set, under various fusion system settings. The reported results shed light on the sensitivity of betweenness, closeness, and degree centrality metrics to fused graph inputs and the role of HVI identification as a test and evaluation tool for fusion process optimization. The computational results demonstrate superiority of path salience approach in identifying HVIs. The insights generated by these approaches and directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract={The Orton-Gillingham (OG) instructional approach has been widely used in different pedagogical settings. This multi-sensory approach has been especially helpful in teaching children with dyslexia and other learning disabilities. In this paper, we show how due to modern-day innovation in ICT like touch-screens, accelerometers, gyroscopes, voice recognition, sound reproduction, powerful processing and wide availability of mobile devices, this approach can help more learners than ever. The paper presents personalization of OG using Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence and demonstrates a software application suited for language learning by dyslexies and pre-school children. We propose that since OG is a one-to-one teacher-student approach, it has special characteristics that can allow ICT devices to become more than teaching aids, but to be used as tutors.},

  abstract={Use of E-learning techniques for education enhancement among the students is popular all over the world. Automation of the pedagogical approaches to deliver the education process remotely, providing interactivity in the learning environment and attaching the students continuously with the learning process are the major objectives of E-learning. Although the interactive mechanisms are presented with modern E-learning solutions, mechanisms on paying concentration on the individual students separately to equal knowledge distribution are very rarely applied in such applications. Since the learners are in different knowledge levels according to the capacities of their mind, for most of them, there is a difficulty of understanding and ensuring the concepts they learn and performing well in the learning environment. Each learner shows different level of aptitude for different subjects, different prior knowledge, different learning styles, different kind of memory, different motivation to learning, different family backgrounds, different habits etc. These variations influence in their patterns and the preferences of learning. Therefore, personalizing the e-learning approaches has become a major research area aimed at knowledge enhancement of the individual students alike by customizing the learning environment according to the individuals' preferences. This paper presents a model of identifying the dynamic and the static learning behavior of the students to personalize the learning environment according to the individuals' learning preferences and the styles of learning. For the extraction of learning styles and the preferences, this research uses the models such as Felder Silverman's model, VAK model, Kolb's' model and Howard Garners Multiple Intelligence model.},

  abstract={We have developed a career guidance system that helps those students who are about to begin their higher education. Most of the time, students are not aware of what career path to follow or which academic major is in accordance with their interests. The system analyzes students' skills, abilities, and interests and recommends the five fields which are most suitable for them. This project helps students identify a specific domain that fits their skills and interests. Smart Career Guidance System is a web-based application built on the Django framework. We have deployed various Machine Learning techniques and algorithms to mimic a one-on-one meeting with an experienced career counselor. The data was collected in the form of a questionnaire that was based on Holland Occupational Themes and the Theory of Multiple Intelligences. A total of 392 graduates completed this online survey. SMOTE oversampling is used to evaluate the machine learning classifiers since the data is highly imbalanced. We tested XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers for recommending the best-suited career options which furnish AUC-ROC performance scores of 0.9952 and 0.9963 respectively. A fine-tuned version of the Random Forest Classifier has successfully attained an AUC-ROC performance score of 0.9976 which indicates the minimal false-positive rate. Ms. Areej Kamal, Ms. Hadia Rafiq and Ms. Batul Naushad have collaboratively conducted all activities of the project including data collection and cleaning, literature review, testing of ML models and development of the final solution. Mr. Shahab Tahzeeb directed and supervised all phases of the project with his immense knowledge and expertise.},

  abstract={Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a promising area of research that leverages computational methods to improve educational outcomes by extracting valuable insights from vast educational datasets. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between EDM and various educational theories, including Learning Analytics Theory (LAT), Educational Psychology Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Theory, Bloom’s Taxonomy Theory, Multiple Intelligences Theory, Schema Theory, Situated Learning Theory, Zone of Proximal Development Theory, and Connectivism Theory. This scientific research provides a comprehensive overview of each theory, and discusses how EDM can be used to enhance the understanding and application of these theories in educational settings. Through various teaching-learning classroom examples, the study illustrates how EDM can help identify students’ learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses, develop algorithms that adapt to students’ learning needs in real-time, predict students’ future academic performance, identify challenging areas of a course, and provide tailored instruction and support to individual students. The study further demonstrates how EDM can inform the design of effective teaching strategies, and contribute to the development of personalized and adaptive learning environments.},

  abstract={In this study, the creation of predictive models for the detection of students at risk of failure is presented. A sample of 618 student profiles , 19% of which failed a given course, were used to detect students at risk of failing. The student profiles were determined from the constructs of Self-Regulation Learning and Affective Strategies (SRLAS) and Multiple Intelligences (MI). The first part of this work, includes an Exploratory Factor Analysis of the data. The predictive phase of the study uses nine Machine Learning classification techniques (KNN, SVM, LDA, QDA, Decision Trees, Random Forest, ADA_Boosting, XGBoosting, and Bayes) to classify students that passed or failed a given course. The Log-Math and the Anxiety dimensions turned out to be relevant variables regarding the success of the student. Decision Trees and Random forests provided the best predicting power. Our results are encouraging in the sense that the methodology followed proves successful at identifying the main factors related to student failure. This may help instructors to timely identify students at risk of failure and their possible causes, to implement appropriate strategies to mitigate this undesirable outcome.},

This contribution concerns the development of an original web-site that has been created for supporting the students enrolled at the course of Mechanical Engineering. The developed Site, called KinSynth, is a virtual space where the students have both download and upload privileges, which allows them to exchange a variety of information, mainly Codes written in Open Source Programming Languages. The system allows all the up-loaders to achieve Authoring credits and this feature trigs certain psychological dynamics among the learners that the Authors of the present investigation are willing to analyze. Hence, an online survey has been proposed to all the registered students-users with two objectives: a) understanding whether the Site is really useful to all the students, or only to a sub-group of them; b) achieving a better knowledge of the learners' typologies and attempting to correlate them with their attitude for these Web-based activities. The questionnaire has been developed on the basis of some indicators which could identify some student typologies, such as, for example, those making reference to the Gardner's multiple intelligence model, and some web-user styles. The results will be used next semester in order to build up new orientation activities.},

  abstract={Collaborative learning can be an effective instructional technique, but the results of studies of online collaboration are inconsistent. Our hypothesis is that student characteristics and group characteristics account for these inconsistencies. Studies investigating interactions during online collaboration have reported some unpredictable group behaviors. This raises important issues about the use of computer-mediated collaboration tools in educational settings. In this paper, we report the results of a two-week long experiment in which eight non-co-located teams of students each designed a green roof for a university client. The students used a suite of on-line collaboration tools, so we could capture all their exchanges in digital form. We measured many student characteristics including personality type, learning style, and multiple intelligence. We developed a measure of the level of group collaboration and studied the effect of group diversity on the degree of collaboration},

  abstract={With the rapid development of information society, people urgently need to develop the traditional city model into a highly information and intelligent city model to meet the needs of users and the development of sociality. Therefore, people put forward a new concept called smart city. Correspondingly, as a concept of multiple intelligence, smart city has also got an excellent opportunity for development in terms of service performance with the emergence of mobile cloud computing, mobile edge computing and some new technologies. Specifically, based on the concept of mobile edge computing, there are many edge servers are installed close to users in smart city, and users can offload tasks to these edge servers to obtain better services by computation offloading. However, in the further development process of this new concept, smart city still need to face some problems in terms of energy consumption, latency, resource utilization and even in privacy security. These issues will affect the service quality of smart city seriously. In view of this, the optimization problem of smart city is studied in this paper. Considering the diversity and large number of users, the tasks generated are defined as a series of complex tasks composed of time-constrained workflows and concurrent constrained workflows, and an energy- and time-efficient method with privacy preservation is proposed, which can optimize the energy consumption, time consumption and the resource of the system jointly. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption and improve resource utilization for the system effectively.},

  abstract={Nowadays, people are more concerned about understanding their children's leardarad types and personality traits. Every individual has a unique personality and innate potential. It is very important to identify inborn talent which can further help to understand the course of interest at a young age. So that they can make the most of the available opportunities in life. Understanding someone's personality can help us to identify in which field they can perform well. The goal of this research paper is to automate the time-consuming manual work. Our research suggests a better way to identify leardarad type and personality based on the fingerprint. Certain elements of brain development and fingerprints are simultaneously produced during fetal development by the combination of hereditary and environmental variables.With the help of dermatoglyphics, we can recognize innate potentials, multiple intelligences, and personality traits from the fingerprints of the person. The suggested system takes scanned fingerprints as input. These scanned images undergo image processing. The images are converted into black and white format using grayscaling. These images are then filtered using a bilateral filter. Morphological operations are also performed on these images. The Gabor filtering technique is used for image enhancement. Features are extracted and dimensionality is reduced using Principle component analysis. A convolutional neural network is trained to accurately identify into seven categories. GradCam technique is used for model evaluation. Thus, we generate a report based on the identified finger type to recommend the leardarad type and personality trait.},

  abstract={Social assistive robotics in autism has been implemented in studies and therapies to improve social skills and encourage children to comply with therapies. However, autism symptoms vary in their spectrum, which generates difficulties in implementing social robotics in a general way. In this study, the CASTOR social robot was implemented in three cases: one case of autism fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and two cases with comorbidities typically excluded in social robotic studies. A pre and post-test professional evaluations were made, and 12 variables about social skills were measured during the implementation. Four sessions of 30 minutes were performed for each study case, improving focal attention, following instructions, working and procedure memory, identifying emotions, and physical and verbal imitation. Regarding the qualification method used at the Howard Gardner Clinic for each speciality, the most remarkable improvements were P1 increased by 20% in physiotherapy, P2 increased by 23% in psychology and P3 increased by 10% in occupational therapy. The pre and posttest results indicate that the presence of the social robot in therapies improves children’s progress independently of their qualities.},
