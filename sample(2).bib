abstract = {In order to improve the quality of English translation teaching, this paper combines the theory of multiple intelligence to classify the English translation teaching process. Moreover, this paper adopts Fisher’s discriminant method and Bayesian discriminant method to classify the English translation teaching samples. In order to improve the discrimination accuracy of the extreme learning machine algorithm, this paper applies the particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine algorithm to the research on the classification of English translation teaching samples and proposes an intelligent English classification teaching model based on the actual situation of English translation teaching. In addition, this paper verifies the system model proposed in this paper by evaluating the teaching method. The research shows that the classification model of English translation teaching mode based on the theory of multiple intelligence proposed in this paper has a certain effect, which can promote the effect of English translation teaching.},

abstract = {It is of great practical significance to study the interactive teaching system of art. The traditional art teaching system is used to analyse the information interaction model, which leads to the poor interaction performance of the system. Therefore, an art interactive teaching system based on multiple intelligence theory was proposed in this paper. The art interactive teaching system mainly consists of interactive teaching service information transmitter, student mark database and web page layering server. Based on hardware design, the entire art interactive teaching system was designed through the information interaction algorithm based on multiple intelligence theory. In order to verify the effectiveness of the designed system, a simulation experiment is performed, the results show that the system has high output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the interaction efficiency is over 80%, which demonstrated the good information interaction performance and excellent application prospects of the system. The system has good application prospects.},

abstract = {The level and style of teaching management have been continuously updated and enhanced as part of China's educational system reform in recent years. A new era of individualized learning and teaching administration has begun as a result of the fusion of cutting-edge educational technologies and pedagogical theories. In light of this, we introduced a teaching management system created for the ever-changing needs of physical education in colleges and universities. We use support vector machines (SVM) to personalize and improve students' educational experiences by using the Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as our theoretical framework. In the very first step, we started with the collection of diverse student information, such as academic records, athletic prowess, and many intelligence profiles. To obtain this information, multiple skills of all the students were thoroughly analyzed using MI’s theory. By conducting thorough feature engineering and data preprocessing, we established the foundation for our analysis using SVM. In this phase, we score each student's performance in sports-related skills. From there, we created a profile for each student and preprocessed the data to build a useful dataset. This dataset trains an SVM model to forecast student engagement and performance using specific kernels and hyperparameters. Our proposed system places a big emphasis on personalized learning. We enable teachers to design a learning environment that fosters student potential by adapting teaching tactics to individual student's strengths and limitations in both sports skills and multiple intelligences. The effectiveness of the system is assessed by separating the students into two groups: one group received training using our suggested system, known as the experimental group, and the other group, known as the control group, received training using the conventional approach. The result shows that the score of the experimental group is 88.9, which is higher than the control group's 83.5. The result shows that after applying MI’s theory and SVM in physical education teaching in colleges and universities, the scores have been significantly improved, which can maximize the students' multiple intelligences.},

abstract = {The field of art is all inclusive, and each art has its own independent theoretical basis and system. This paper mainly studies the practical significance of music aesthetics based on the theory of multiple intelligences. This paper randomly selected two classes of students as the research object, and the ratio of male and female students in the two classes was similar, and the teachers were the same. In the process of the experiment, based on the theory of multiple intelligences, music teaching guidance was given to the students in the experimental class, and the conventional teaching methods were used in the control class. After that, they were trained for 15 weeks. Using SPSS17.0 software to analyze the students' scores, and compare the changes of students' scores before and after the test, and get the experimental results. The average score of the pre-test results of the experimental class was 18.4082, and that of the control class was 18.3725. The sig value of the independent sample t-test was 0.955 &gt; 0.05. The results show that the theory of multiple intelligences has a significant role in promoting music art.},

abstract = {College students with creativity and organizational innovation ability are the needs of all walks of life in modern society. The theory of multiple intelligences makes the teaching implementation and teaching evaluation more reasonable and diversified, and provides practical and effective guidance for teachers to understand and master the theory and apply the theory in teaching. This paper makes a critical analysis of college students' creativity and organizational innovation under the teaching management based on the theory of multiple intelligences. This paper adopts the method of literature analysis and sampling survey to study. In the research, 400 college students under the teaching management based on the theory of multiple intelligences are selected. Through questionnaire survey, the appropriate quantitative table is selected to evaluate the creativity and organizational innovation ability of college students under the teaching management based on the theory of multiple intelligences. The results show that in the total evaluation of creative thinking, there are 66 people in a level, 174 in B level, 130 in C level and 30 in D level. It can be seen that the creativity and organizational innovation of college students are relatively mediocre. On the basis of these research results, we make a critical analysis of this.},
